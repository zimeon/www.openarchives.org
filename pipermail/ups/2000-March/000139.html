I applaud Stevan's enthusiasm, but I'm afraid he's proposing to trade 
a link management problem for a version control problem. Either of 
those problems is preferable to stasis, but in some ways the version 
control problem is more insidious than the link problem. If you get a 
404 error and no information, you know where you stand. If you get an 
out-of-date version of paper from a harvesting archive, you don't 
know it unless you chase down the copy from the archive of record. 
Dienst has some hooks to help resolve the multiple copy/version 
control problem. We need to make sure that the OAI policies require 
scrupulous adherence to good management practices, and we need to run 
the 'archives of archives' in such a way that they can route around 
problematic downstream sites.
