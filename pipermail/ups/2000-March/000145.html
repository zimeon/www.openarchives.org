<PRE>Hi!  Many people involved in OAI, including those actively working
on implementations, have not replied to the request below regarding
our 2nd workshop.  We need you there!  Please, everyone, if you have
not, reply soon.  We must have a good list of possible attendees
so I can try to get travel funds to help out.

Many thanks, eaf
