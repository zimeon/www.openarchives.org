<PRE>What do you think about this?
These logicians are not afraid to make bold moves...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>STS-L subscribers may be interested in this message that Carol Hutchins
forwarded to SLA-PAM.  It is wonderful that the editors of the Journal of
Logic Programming have seceded from Elsevier, after having tried without
success to get Elsevier to agree to reasonable pricing.  Northwestern is
cancelling its subscription to JLP, and we will order the new journal from
Cambridge University Press when it is available. Libraries that have
signed up with ScienceDirect may find themselves locked in to JLP and
unable to cancel -- presumably that is just as Elsevier wants it.  A
demonstration, if one was needed, of the folly (from the point of view of
the customer and of the scholarly community, though not from the point of
view of the publisher) of ScienceDirect, IDEAL, and other all-or-nothing,
take-it-or-leave-it plans.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Subject: (DBWORLD) Appeal to the libraries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;X-Message-Number: 003
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      An appeal to the libraries concerning a new journal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LOGIC PROGRAMMING (TPLP)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             (<A HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/projects/alp/TPLP">http://www.cwi.nl/projects/alp/TPLP</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This is an appeal to the libraries to subscribe to this new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;journal. The following background information may clarify the matters.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;In November 1999 the complete Editorial Board of the Journal of Logic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Programming (JLP) of Elsevier Press (50 editors in total) collectively
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;resigned after 16 months of unsuccessful negotiations with Elsevier
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Press about the price of library subscriptions.  They founded a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;journal, Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP) with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Cambridge University Press (CUP).  The first issue of TPLP will appear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;in January 2001. For the current list of accepted papers please
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;consult the home page of the TPLP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The price per page of the TPLP journal will be approximately 55% lower
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;than that of the JLP.  It will initially be published bi-monthly in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;both print and electronic form. The actual extent and subscription
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;price of TPLP will be announced soon by the CUP in its own advertising
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;campaign.  The Founding Editor of the journal is Professor Emeritus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Jack Minker of the University of Maryland.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The Association for Logic Programming, acting in full cooperation with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the former Editorial Board of the JLP, withdrew its support for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;JLP and adopted TPLP as the sole official journal of the ALP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Moreover, several authors withdrew in the meantime their submissions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;to the JLP and resubmitted them to TPLP. At this moment only one paper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;handled by the former Area Editors of the JLP is still active for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;JLP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The former Editors agreed to keep their names on the masthead of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;JLP until the end of 2000, the moment when all the papers processed by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;them for the JLP will have been published.  Elsevier Press decided to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;continue the JLP as of 2001 &quot;with another editorial board&quot;.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Association, the former Editors, and the logic programming community,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;strongly believe that there is support for only one logic programming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;journal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
