I agree with Stevan's assessment that once a paper is placed on any 
web server accessible by the public and open to search engine robots, 
the genie is out of the bottle, the worms are out of the can, the 
horse is out of the barn, and there's no getting it back in there.

My concern with including links to 'personal' servers on an eprint 
site is technical. Those links need to be maintained. By allowing an 
'abstract + link' model (absent a robust and widely adopted solution 
for creating and resolving persistent identifiers), we greatly 
increase the likelihood of broken links on the preprint server. I see 
'404 Document Not Found' often enough already...

&gt;<i>(3) And, yes, the Santa Fe protocol and the Open Archives Initiative
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/">http://www.openarchives.org/</A>&gt; are definitely relevant, because they

</I>
I'm not convinced that we've given enough thought to the implications 
of a large number of small author-managed repositories with regard to 
the issues of access, availability and persistency of scholarly 
publications. It's very cheap and easy to set up a server. It's much 
more difficult and costly to keep it running over the long haul, with 
good security, reliability, performance, and consistency.
