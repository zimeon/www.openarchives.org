<PRE>Christopher Gutteridge is making Eprints 1.1 compliant with the the
January 23 release of OAI 1.0. He has some queries along the way that
some of you might wish to respond to:

Subject: Current State of Play for EPrints

Hi, I'm Christopher Gutteridge.

I'm working to make eprints OAI1.0 compliant.

I'm pretty much up to speed on the system, and hope/plan to have
eprints 1.1 ready for Jan 23rd. 

Some thoughts and comments are below, not all of these are of interest
to everyone getting this mail, so I've split them into themed
sections.

----------------------
GOING FROM OAI 0.2 to OAI 1.0 (0.9e)

The protocol seems to no longer use XML namespace prefixes, I'll remove
them; can someone explain the implications of this (briefly)?

the new &lt;about&gt; section in GetRecord is optional so I'm ignoring it. 
Is this wise?

It would seem helpful to provide data on what sets a record is in, as a
list of OAI setSpec's. Although I admit it's rather late in the day to
be adding things - if someone really needs it, they could use &lt;about&gt;,
although it would seem more logical to add it to the header (or another
section in &lt;record&gt;)

---------------------- 
EPRINTS 1.1 (OAI 1.0)

I've been through the current bugs in jitterbug, and I think I can 
address a number (most?) of them.

the change log [should] look roughly like this:

Core code changes:
- Added cgi/oai to release and modified OpenArchives.pm
  System now supports oai 1.0
- modified configure to no longer use gnu-only features of commands
- added database port and host options to configure
- modified Database.pm, bin/erase_archive, bin/update_htaccess to
  know about database_host and database_port.
- improved the error messages in the Makefile if a user or group
  already exist.

Configuration changes/additions:
- Extra fields added to describe the oai identity (for oai 1.0)
- added database_host and database_port fields
- modifed default html to refer to &quot;items&quot; rather than &quot;papers&quot;

----------------------
UPGRADING EPRINTS 1.0 TO USE OAI 1.0

For people running 1.0 who don't want to reinstall/overinstall I plan
to supply the new versions of OpenArchives.pm and cgi/oai which should 
drop in plus the list of things to add to SiteInfo.pm - this should be
safer than an autoconf-upgrade.

The other changes planned for 1.1 are primarily to make configuration 
and installation slightly easier.
----------------------
TESTING 

I plan to do the live test of the OAI1.0 version files on cogprints sometime 
late next week, hopefully it can be then checked for compliance.

Once I've got the code roughly together I'll create an eprints 1.1 
pre-release for testing.

----------------------
IDEAS FOR MODIFYING EPRINTS FOR A DEPARTMENTAL DATABASE

[This may be of interest to those who wish to adapt Eprints for
specialized internal use]

I'm investigating replacing the current departmental database with
eprints. The current database is very site-specific, although Robert
Tansley reused some of the good parts of the design for Eprints, and,
more importantly, improved some of the problems.

The big problems using eprints for our needs are:

- We don't want public subscription. The 'registered' users list and
user info should be created and updated from the departmental systems.

:<i> I think I can implement this relatively easily - it mostly involves
</I>pruning eprints code and writing one or two nightly scripts.

- We need to be able to reference which papers belong to which members
of staff. One paper could have 3 authors, 2 of which are in the
department.

:<i> Solution - a field which has a (comma seperated?) list of local
</I>usernames, and then an addition to the script which builds the static
pages for sets to build a static page for each staff member.

- This is the tricky one. We can't make all the records in the database
public, the metadata can be, but the content must be restricted. My
current idea is to create a &quot;private&quot; data type in addition to ASCII,
HTML etc. which is spotted by the bit of code that stores the files and
have it pop a .htaccess file (or a symlink to a system wide one) which
can limit who can download the contents of that directory.

---------------

Any advice, suggestions, or even praise is most welcome.
