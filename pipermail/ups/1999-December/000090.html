Hi!

We had talked about a meeting in connection with ACM Digital Libraries
2000.  I consulted with Herbert, Paul, and Carl about this 1 day
workshop.

Since it was not feasible for others to send in something,
the following was submitted. We should hear back late January,
I believe. The meeting would be between HT'00 and DL'00, hopefully
during the period 6/2 -6/4/2000 (Friday-Sunday). Please do hold these
dates (and related conference dates if they are of interest too) and
see details on place and programs at
   <A HREF="http://www.dl00.org/">http://www.dl00.org/</A>
   <A HREF="http://www.ht00.org/">http://www.ht00.org/</A>

I apologize if I've misrepresented things or given this a twist that
people find inappropriate. We can &quot;fix&quot; such problems after the
proposal is accepted - please send comments.

One of my students is willing to help with arrangements. Also, if
there are ideas regarding who might fund travel, please advise so
we can submit needed paperwork.

Hope this helps, regards, Ed

Subject: workshop proposal for DL'2000 (and HT'2000 - late, but I hope
it will fit between the two)


Title:
 Extending Interoperability of Digital Libraries:
 Building on the Open Archives Initiative

Background on Open Archives Initiative:
 see <A HREF="http://vole.lanl.gov/ups/ups.htm">http://vole.lanl.gov/ups/ups.htm</A>

Duration: full-day, with attendees encouraged to attend both
   parts but possibility of attending either morning or afternoon

Audience/Participants:
This will be an open meeting with selection of participants based on:
 1) an email proposal of not more than 1000 words (half on what a
    person can contribute to the meeting topics and half on their
    background/prior work); and
 2) on prior involvement in the Open Archives Initiative.
We expect 20-40 participants.  The following attended the Santa Fe
meeting and will be encouraged to join this workshop as well:
    Caroline Arms - Library of Congress 
    Les Carr - University of Southampton &amp; CogPrints 
    Eric Celeste - MIT 
    Mark Doyle - the American Physical Society 
    Dale Flecker - Harvard University

    Paul Ginsparg - Los Alamos National Laboratory &amp; arXiv.org 
    Paul Gherman - Vanderbilt University (representative of ARL and
                   Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) 
    Stevan Harnad - University of Southampton &amp; CogPrints

    Simeon Warner - Los Alamos National Laboratory &amp; arXiv.org 
    Don Waters - The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation 
    Ken Weiss - University of California

Theme:
  The Open Archives initiative has been set up to create a
forum to discuss and solve matters of interoperability
between author self-archiving solutions, as a way to
promote their global acceptance.
  This workshop will continue and extend the work of the
first meeting of the initiative, that was held October 21-22,
1999 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA.

Purpose and Goals:
* disseminate results from the Santa Fe meeting
* review progress toward Open Archives, i.e., give a
  concise post mortem of progress to-date
* provide a forum for presentation and discuss of proposals
  to extend early work toward Open Archives

Expected Outcomes:
* new protocols
* new service definitions
* D-Lib paper(s)
* suggested research agenda for interoperability

Relevance to the Field:
* Interoperability is a major focus in the digital libraries field.
* Integrating linking with Open Archives is closely tied to hypertext.

Activities:
* The day will be a mix of short presentations and discussions.
* There may be a period of 60-90 minutes in the afternoon for
  breakout sessions followed by 30 minutes of plenary presentation
  if the attendance warrants.

Topical Outline:
* Morning
  - Review of Santa Fe meeting
  - Report and discussion on metadata efforts
  - Report and discussion on protocol and server efforts
  - Report and discussion on harvesting
  - Report and discussion on integrated services
  - Other business of the Open Archives initiative
* Afternoon
  - Presentation of proposals for layers, protocols and services
     browsing, federation, linking, logging, multilingual access,
     preservation, visualization
  - Discussion of data quality and data cleaning
  - Discussion of extensions to other &quot;super-archives&quot;
  - Where do we go from here ...

Comments on organizers:
  Fox, Lagoze and Van de Sompel were involved in the Santa
Fe meeting and are actively working on the Open Archives initiative.
Suleman is a PhD student working with Fox; his research focus is on
this and closely related topics. He is funded by NSF to work on developing
a &quot;super-archive&quot; related to WWW logs and research in that field.
  Fox has organized a large number of workshops at ACM conferences as
well as served as program chair for ACM DL'96 and '99. Formerly he was
vice chair and then chair of ACM SIGIR, for the period 1988-1995.
  Lagoze is one of the lead technical contributors to the Open Archives
initiative. He has directed a number of digital library projects and
has been an active participant in many workshops and conferences.
  Van de Sompel has led much of the Open Archives effort, including
a large portion of the work before and after the Santa Fe meeting.
  Others from the Open Archives initiative are likely to play key
roles in this workshop, so the list of organizers is subject to change.
