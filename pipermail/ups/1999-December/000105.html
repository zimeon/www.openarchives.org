<PRE>Greetings,

&gt;<i> From: Carl Lagoze &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lagoze@cs.cornell.edu">lagoze@cs.cornell.edu</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Date: 1999-12-20 15:19:38 -0500

&gt;<i> I finally got a chance to look at the DTD and I think its got a hole in it. 
</I>&gt;<i> You have author with simply PCData but as spec'ed its structured - name and 
</I>&gt;<i> organization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take a look at the output of:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ncstrl.org:8070/Dienst/Repository/1.0/Disseminate/xxx/001/%23oams">http://www.ncstrl.org:8070/Dienst/Repository/1.0/Disseminate/xxx/001/%23oams</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> /xml
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and see if that makes sense to you.  It seems that the author &quot;name&quot; should 
</I>&gt;<i> be required and the &quot;organization&quot; optional. Yes?
</I>
I am going to try and update the DTD this week.. I think what you suggest is  
fine, but doesn't reflect the discussion at the conference itself where I  
thought it had been decided that there would be no structure. Personally, I  
agree with what you say (but arXiv may have problems with its unstructured  
data). Opinions?

I am going to add the &lt;p&gt; tag for enclosing paragraphs of the abstract.

I also think we should allow people to add their own elements using an  
extender tag (suggesting &lt;extension&gt; with attribute &quot;name&quot;) so that people  
can do things like:

&lt;extension name=&quot;version&quot;&gt;v1&lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;extension name=&quot;Subj-class&quot;&gt;MSC 1234&lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;extension name=&quot;source&quot;&gt;TeX&lt;/extension&gt;

This may encourage people to use the DTD and the metadata scheme without  
having to force them to lump everything into unindentifed &lt;comment&gt; tags.  
Part of the convention will be that people agree not to use the extender tag  
is there is a core element that already covers the data being tagged. We  
could use &lt;comment&gt; as the extender element as well.

If a particular name becomes prevalent, it can be promoted to its own tag to  
formalize the vocabulary. Does that seem reasonable?

Also, how about an oams: namespace (mapped to a URL at <A HREF="http://openarchives.org">http://openarchives.org</A>)?

Cheers,
Mark
