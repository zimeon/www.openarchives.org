<PRE>Hi,

Not much feedback - everyone awake out there?

Anyway, one request has been to allow for multiple paragraphs in the  
abstract. Two suggestions:

1) a &lt;p&gt; tag
2) specify a convention of allowing a blank line. Since whitespace in XML is  
significant, this would probably be OK.

I prefer 1 I think.

Also, the person asked &quot;Is it intentional that the version history,
the available formats, file sizes, and number of pages are missing?&quot; to  
which the answer is, of course, yes. But should we perhaps allow an attribute  
on the &lt;comment&gt; field to allow people to specify what is in the comment? Or  
we could include another &quot;extender&quot; tag with a different name to do the same  
thing. Of course, the vocabulary of the attribute value won't be controlled,  
but may be it will encourage more people to use the DTD and we could use it  
to eventually identify elements that should be promoted to their own  
elements.

Cheers,
Mark
