<PRE>Hi all,

I discussed matters related to this with Stevan during a break at our
Santa Fe meeting.  Actually, I suggested to (ab)use the Subject field as
a carrier for the information on the journal(s) in which the author
would like his eprint to be published. Whether this information would
indeed belong in the Subject field or in a seperate Journal field is
open for discussion.  I think that - in addition to the arguments that
Stevan uses, this idea has the following benefits:

- There is a universal understanding regarding the subject areas of
journals, meaning that there exists an agreed upon global
subject-oriented namespace being the journal namespace (that actually
even has unique identiefiers - ISSNs).  This can hardly be said about
other subject classifications.  
- It is a type of Subject classification that can indeed be added by the
author, who IS a connoisseur of the journals in his domain, but hardly
is a subject classification expert.  This is a type of subject
classification that has a true sense of longeivity whereas many other
schemes (inlcuding free keywords) are very time-dependent.  It is a
subject classification that could be used by whomever and that could
lead to very interesrting features in end-user services.
- It could be used as a gateway mechanism between eprint archives and
publishers: publishers could harvest records that have their journal
names in the Subject/Journal field and decide whether they are or are
not interested in publishing the paper.
- I see this as a very nice way to gently parasite on the existing
communication system.  

greetings

</I>&gt;<i> Another Santa Fe afterthought -- or rather an amplification of
</I>&gt;<i> something I regret that I said so tentatively and diminutively
</I>&gt;<i> at the end of the minimalist tag-session:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be a GREAT mistake not to include &lt;journalname&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> among our absolute minimal tag set (along with author, title, etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Carl generated the minimal set off the top of his head -- and it's a
</I>&gt;<i> good head, that has thought about these matters a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But from the point of view of a minimal set of tags -- with a maximum
</I>&gt;<i> of, say, 7 -- I would certainly find much less use for two mandatory date
</I>&gt;<i> tags than a mandatory journalname tag (which, by default, for preprint
</I>&gt;<i> would be NULL).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After all, the journal literature is our primary constituency, and
</I>&gt;<i> journalname is one of its most informative descriptors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I sensed that the motivation for not including it among the minimal set
</I>&gt;<i> was an expectation or desire on the part of soime of us that journals
</I>&gt;<i> might cease to exist -- plus some untested notions about what &quot;vetting&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> systems might replace them, again, on the part of some of us.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be a great mistake to leave one of the most robust,
</I>&gt;<i> representative and useful descriptors out of our minimal set, on the
</I>&gt;<i> basis of this sort of speculative hypothesis and desideratum (with
</I>&gt;<i> which many of us may not be in agreement).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I vote that journalname be included as a mandatory field in the
</I>&gt;<i> minimal set (including NULL for not-submitted-to-a-journal).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If even the minimal self-archives have the journal field, then something
</I>&gt;<i> even as simple as Alta Vista could be sent to retrieve the (minimal) archival
</I>&gt;<i> presence of any or every refereed journal: an extremely important and
</I>&gt;<i> appealing feature that could hasten everything we hope for (including
</I>&gt;<i> the demise of the journals, if that is fated to occur, after first having
</I>&gt;<i> drawn their contents up into the skies).
</I>&gt;<i>
