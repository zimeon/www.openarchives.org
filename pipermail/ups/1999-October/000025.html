The first eScholarship initiative is University ePub, a set of
disciplinary e-print servers and services whose overall aim is to 
lead and support innovations in the production and dissemination of
scholarship. (For further information, see

Collaborate with faculty members and scholarly societies in establishing
University ePub, archives of scholarship and identifying opportunities
to establish or migrate electronic journals supported by archives.
Collaborate with senior CDL staff on business models and issues of
sustainability; education, public information, technology transfer; and
evaluation; and defining and allocating the technology support necessary
to implement services and standards.

Must have knowledge of existing and emergent standards and practices
regarding digital publishing, digital libraries, and other scholarly
information resources and their Internet distribution. Demonstrated
success in working collaboratively with researchers and scholars.
Knowledge of the technical context and digital materials sufficient to
coordinate projects effectively and to contribute to program and project
results. Excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Demonstrated
success in new program leadership and project management. Understanding
of electronic scholarly communication and a commitment to the academy's
goal of broad and minimally constrained dissemination of scholarship.
