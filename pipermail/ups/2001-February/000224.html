From: ePrints Support (Christopher Gutteridge) &lt;<A HREF="mailto:support@eprints.org">support@eprints.org</A>&gt;
Subject: Multiple language Support for Eprints.

eprints.org is beginning to gain some multi-language functionality.

I plan to have &quot;language&quot; files with all the phrases used by eprints in
them. I will maintain an English version, and arrange to make it as
easy as possible to create/maintain other languages - hopefully a
script to compare any language file with the english file and spot any
missing phrases etc.

It's time-consuming applying this change, but also easy. It will take a
while to get the whole code done.

The advantage of this method is that although each eprint.org archive
will have a default language, a user could view the CGI scripts in any
language supported, using cookies or something!

I'm currently considering how to make the static pages support multiple
languages... I'm considering mod_rewrite using the same cookie. I think
static pages are a slightly different issue from the main code, as
people will want to customise those, and customising in more than one
language will be more than most people, especially anglocentric ones,
will want to do.

The other issue is the &quot;help&quot; in the metadata cfg section and various
blocks of english text in the site routines.=20

Some of SiteInfo.pm may go from:

$EPrintsSite::SiteInfo::blurb =3D &quot;This is some blurb only in english&quot;;

to

$EPrintsSite::SiteInfo::blurb{english} =3D &quot;This is some blurb only in engl=
ish&quot;;

With the option to add any language you support; how does this sound?

My main concern is not making any significant extra work to deploy
eprints.org for people who DON'T care about this issue.

Please see the attached file for an example of a language file - this
is only somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 of the final length I'm
expecting.

I'd be keen for some of you to at least have a go at translating some
of this so I've got some french (and other language) text to work with
(I'm afraid I am a monoglot). Also let me know if there is anything
good/bad about the way that I've organised it.

The file is organised by the file which uses the phrase. Eg. User.pm
Each line has a ID for the phrase eg:

H:thanks =3D Thank-you. Your paper named $(1) is now in the system.

&quot;H&quot; indicates that this will be displayed as HTML so &amp;aacute; etc are
acceptable. Other types, &quot;M&quot; for example, will need different escaping
of such characters, or they may be altogether illegal.

Rather than split a sentence into two phrases, the system inserts data
into the points at $(1) $(2) etc...
