<PRE>hi,

I want to share this information regarding the upcoming launch of a
preprint server for chemistry, intended to become compliant to the Santa
Fe convention.

I have a meeting with the people involved, early August.

greetings

===========

INFO ON CPS:

With 100,000 articles being published in the field of chemistry
annually,
the Chemistry Preprint Server (CPS) represents a major potential benefit
for
authors, publishers and researchers alike. Every article submitted
becomes
the subject of a discussion group and authors will be free to update or
replace material after their articles are already live. Chemists around
the
world will be able to tap into a vast resource of up-to-date research
information.

Submission of articles will be easy. A web-based input form will allow
articles to be submitted in standard word processor format, then date
and
time stamped. Articles will be converted automatically to PDF, and
classified and archived according to existing chemistry classifications
on
the ChemWeb.com site.

Quote:

&quot;The Chemistry Preprint Server (CPS) could be the start of a revolution
in
chemistry publishing as we know it today. As the online community for
chemists of all disciplines ChemWeb.com is proud to launch and host it,&quot;
said Dr. Bill Town, Director of Operations, ChemWeb Inc. Town continued,
&quot;the service has been specifically designed to support basic
interoperability among e-print archives. We hope that through discussion
with the Open Archive initiative we will soon be accepted as compliant
with
the Santa Fe Convention.&quot;


</pre>
