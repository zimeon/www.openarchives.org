&gt;<i> Open Archiving folk,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was just made aware of an interesting proposal for Online Journal
</I>&gt;<i> Citation linking.
</I>&gt;<i> Take a look at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/reuters/0,1349,32592,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/reuters/0,1349,32592,00.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> if you are interested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is all the info I know; HighWire has not been officially asked to
</I>&gt;<i> do anything for the journals we publish, yet.

Boy, is this thing being overhyped. It made it into the NY Times,
news.cnet.com, Cronicle of Higher Education, blah, blah, blah. Personally, I  
think it is a step backwards, at least in the realm of physics (APS will not  
be participating anytime soon). The DOI system for linking journal articles  
in physics introduces more problems and expenses than it solves. Much better  
is something like Hellman's S-Links-S (LinkOpenly now I think). No time now  
for a full rant now, but I think people should be very careful before
creating DOI's for their works and before buying into a DOI system as their  
primary linking interface.

Cheers,
Mark
