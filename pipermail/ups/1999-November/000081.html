<PRE>Below is precisely the confusion that the interoperable Open Archives
Initiative can and will resolve:

&gt;<i> sh&gt; after striking out those passages (which lately include attempts to

</I>&gt;<i> sh&gt; all &quot;personal servers&quot; on the Web are public! These distinctions are
</I>&gt;<i> sh&gt; based on paper publishing categories that simply have no counterpart on
</I>&gt;<i> sh&gt; the Web; hence the mootness of the older agreements).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although I have been following this debate with great interest over the
</I>&gt;<i> last few years, I rarely comment.  I was intrigued, however, at the
</I>&gt;<i> distinction between &quot;public&quot; servers and &quot;private&quot; servers attempted by
</I>&gt;<i> commercial publishers.  It's easy to see what they mean - &quot;Nature&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> Medline are &quot;public sites&quot; ie places one would go to seek out literature
</I>&gt;<i> that one was hitherto unaware of, while my Departmental home page is a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;private&quot; site and one would perhaps only find my paper there if one knew
</I>&gt;<i> it was there to begin with, or if one stumbled across it fortuitously.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The trouble is, as you point out, it's a very tenuous distinction.  I would
</I>&gt;<i> love to know how they would view a paper which was archived (physically) on
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;private&quot; server, but which was pointed to by a link on an abstract
</I>&gt;<i> residing on a &quot;public&quot; server.  The reader would of course, neither know
</I>&gt;<i> nor care where the document in fact resided, as long as there was a
</I>&gt;<i> hyperlinked trail from the public site.  Does this mean that &quot;privately&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> archived papers are illegal if they are referenced by a hyperlink from the
</I>&gt;<i> existing &quot;public&quot; literature? And how would one know or enforce it?  What
</I>&gt;<i> if one publishes the hyperlink to one's &quot;private&quot; site in the abstract of
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;public&quot; version?  Or if one's article is indirectly hyperlinked
</I>&gt;<i> (deliberately or unwittingly) by an intermediate paper?  Would one ban
</I>&gt;<i> hyperlinked references in published papers just in case they led to an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;illegally archived&quot; paper?  What about papers in the future which exist
</I>&gt;<i> not as discrete documents but as database entries in a number of parts
</I>&gt;<i> (possible distributed across servers) which are assembled &quot;on-the-fly&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> different forms for different users?  The situation rapidly becomes
</I>&gt;<i> ludicrous.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course there could well be technological solutions to the situation,
</I>&gt;<i> given a unified effort on the part of commercial publishers.  Take, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, the copy-protection/piracy battle over the last 2 decades, or the
</I>&gt;<i> current MP3 controversy.  It would have been naive to say 20 years ago &quot;but
</I>&gt;<i> files can easily be copied, so protection of software is impossible&quot;.  And
</I>&gt;<i> on the Web, one can never say &quot;never&quot;!
