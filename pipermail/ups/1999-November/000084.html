<PRE>Good query from Ed: Any ideas? All I know of personally is my own
polemical writing...

Cheers, Stevan

Hi!

One idea for discussion.

Students at most institutions know little about the
evolution of scholarly communication, the concepts of
open sharing, the economics of library purchases of
journals, the broad field of intellectual property rights,
and many other important concerns.  One aspect of NDLTD has
been to raise these topics for open discussion at universities
and to encourage local seminars, online educational materials,
and other means of engaging young scholars to be aware of the
issues and options.

Toward that end I wonder if there is a single place with a
small collection of papers about these matters that we might
point to? It might be best for this collection or a Web
bibliography page about it to reside at the new Web site for
the Open Archives Initiative?  For example, it might have 
a few of the clearest statements about self-archiving.

I welcome your comments and guidance.  Regards, Ed

Hi Ed,

That's the bbc link and it might be because your mailer truncated it.
//news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/education/features/newsid_521000/521816.stm

It works fine if you get all the way to the end (stm).

&gt;<i> Second, please start

</I>&gt;<i> the very few efforts that are focused on UNIVERSITIES, to help

</I>&gt;<i> are focused on a particularly scholarly community.  I continue to
</I>&gt;<i> be surprised that groups don't realize that if we have all theses
</I>&gt;<i> and dissertations self-archived, which I've been working on since
</I>&gt;<i> 1987, that this will go a very long way to a radical transformation
</I>&gt;<i> of the scholarly publishing enterprise.
</I>
Ok, I will put the NDLTD link on my home page and elsewhere too.

Obviously it would help if the Provosts promoted faculty/researcher
self-archiving hand-in-hand with dissertation self-archiving.

In the genericized, interoperable version of the CogPrints software
(OpenPrints or something like that) dissertations will be one of the
options for the kinds of document that can be deposited.

Is there any way we can amalgamate? There's no point designing a
different open archive for every document type...

Chrs, Stevan

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Steve, Charles, David and Ira:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (and others interested in implementing the Scholars Forum Initiative)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will make this brief: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are indeed serious about wanting to do it, we can now implement
</I>&gt;<i> Scholars Forum and the recommendations we made to the AAU in 1997
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;<A HREF="http://www.econ.rochester.edu/Faculty/PhelpsPapers/Phelps_paper.html">http://www.econ.rochester.edu/Faculty/PhelpsPapers/Phelps_paper.html</A>&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&lt;<A HREF="http://library.caltech.edu/publications/ScholarsForum/proceedings.htm">http://library.caltech.edu/publications/ScholarsForum/proceedings.htm</A>&gt;
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> within 2-3 months, and the freeing of the entire journal literature
</I>&gt;<i> should then not lag far behind. Our 1997 consensus was:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	    1) The AAU would play a central role in leading member
</I>&gt;<i> 	    universities towards forming a multi-national consortium
</I>&gt;<i> 	    focused on key issues such as certification and reliable
</I>&gt;<i> 	    electronic access to scholarly results
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	    2) Attendees would stimulate further discussion of key
</I>&gt;<i> 	    issues on their campuses and among themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	    3) Academic administrators would encourage and support
</I>&gt;<i> 	    promising) initiatives and share outcomes with attendees.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a result of the recent meeting of the Open Archive Initiative and
</I>&gt;<i> the adoption of the Santa Fe Convention
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;<A HREF="http://vole.lanl.gov/ups/ups1-press.htm">http://vole.lanl.gov/ups/ups1-press.htm</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> we are at the moment redesigning the CogPrints Archive Software to make
</I>&gt;<i> it Santa-Fe-compliant and generic, so that every university will be able
</I>&gt;<i> to mount it, free, to establish its own open archives for all its
</I>&gt;<i> disciplines. All the open archives will be interoperable and integrated
</I>&gt;<i> seamlessly via the NCSTRL gateway into a global virtual archive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&lt;<A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/education/features/newsid_521000/521816.st">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/education/features/newsid_521000/521816.st</A>
&gt;<i> m&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The key to the success of this initiative is 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     (1) broad (and prompt) adoption of the interoperable archives by
</I>&gt;<i>     universities worldwide and
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     (2) a strong incentive to each university's authors to self-archive
</I>&gt;<i>     their papers in them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All copyright problems can be avoided by adopting the following policy:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     (a) All authors are strongly encouraged to strike out any passage
</I>&gt;<i>     that would cede their right to self-archive their final, accepted
</I>&gt;<i>     draft online before signing their copyright transfer agreement with
</I>&gt;<i>     their publishers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     (b) If they have already signed a copyright transfer agreement that
</I>&gt;<i>     denies their right to self-archive their final, accepted draft
</I>&gt;<i>     online, they should either 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	    (i) self-archive a penultimate draft (pre-refereeing
</I>&gt;<i> 	    preprint) and append a list of all the changes that were
</I>&gt;<i> 	    made to turn it into the final accepted draft, or they
</I>&gt;<i> 	    should
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	    (ii) self-archive a revised, expanded (post-publication)
</I>&gt;<i> 	    draft and append a list of the changes that were made to
</I>&gt;<i> 	    the final accepted draft.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> University administrators and librarians (and library users) are all
</I>&gt;<i> asking what they can do to resolve the serials crisis. Here is a way
</I>&gt;<i> that could resolve it almost instantly, if only we go ahead and do it!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Important suggestion: Have a slush fund available to help out authors
</I>&gt;<i> who -- once they have come to understand the critical causal link
</I>&gt;<i> between (I) their self-archiving of their own papers in the open
</I>&gt;<i> archives, and (II) the freeing of the journal literature for one and
</I>&gt;<i> all (along with the increased impact the open access will give to their
</I>&gt;<i> published research) -- reply to you:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;I'd like to do it, but I'm too busy/nontechnical/old! Here's the
</I>&gt;<i>     disk with my papers: YOU archive it for me.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A modest slush fund to pay Web-savvy students to archive the first
</I>&gt;<i> wave of papers on behalf of their authors will be a HUGE facilitator in
</I>&gt;<i> getting the whole project over the top. (The archive is being designed
</I>&gt;<i> to be exceedingly easy and friendly: only a few minutes for the first
</I>&gt;<i> paper by an author, and even fewer from then onward for all the rest.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You four (Steve, Charles, David and Ira) have been involved in the
</I>&gt;<i> Scholars Forum Initiative since it started as the Conference on the
</I>&gt;<i> Future of Scholarly Communication at the Cal Tech in March, 1997.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if you are willing to carry the initiative further,
</I>&gt;<i> now, in the spirit of that conference's consensus, by promoting the
</I>&gt;<i> adoption (and use!) of the generic open archives in the next few months.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (All others who are in a position to facilitate open archives at their
</I>&gt;<i> universities are also encouraged to contact me if they are interested.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes,
</I>&gt;<i>
