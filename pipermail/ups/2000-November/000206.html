NCSTRL was effectively the model for OAi. Greg Kuperberg suggests that 
NCSTRL has not been successful. It would be useful to have some meaningful 
measure of whether NCSTRL has been successful or not, and to hear the views 
of the NCSTRL developers (who are also involved in OAi). Maybe real 
evidence will yield clues to the ultimate destiny of OAi - central or 
distributed.

The Harnad-Kuperberg dialogue has been fascinating but, to my mind, hasn't 
resolved the issue conclusively. It will be critical to understand what the 
user wants.
