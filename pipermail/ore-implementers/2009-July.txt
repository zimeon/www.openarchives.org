Good day



My name is Jorgina Paihama (Digital Libraries Laboratory, Department of
Computer Science, at the University of Cape Town).



I would like to thank everyone who participated on the interoperability
survey (http://banzai.cs.uct.ac.za/survey/index.php?sid=97137&lang=en).



A summary of the findings obtained from the survey results can be found at
the following address:

Thank You

Jorgina Paihama
