<PRE>hi all,

We would like to provide you with an update regarding the OAI-ORE effort.

Since the last successful in-person meeting of the TC at the Google 
offices in NYC, a team has been working in a focused manner to compile a 
set of proposed draft OAI-ORE specifications. The so-called OAI-ORE 
Acceleration Effort was supported by the ORE Mellon grant and by 
additional funding from Microsoft. The people directly involved in this 
effort were: Julie Allinson, Chris Bizer, Carl Lagoze, Michael Nelson, 
Rob Sanderson, Herbert Van de Sompel, and Simeon Warner.  The addition 
of Chris Bizer to our team provided important input from the semantic 
web community.

We plan to share the set of drafts listed below by September 30th with 
TC, LG, AG and our sponsors. This private release of the drafts will 
initiate the review process by TC, LG, and AG, which we would like to 
conclude by the end of 2007. At that time, we would like to be able to 
publicly release the resulting documents as alpha OAI-ORE 
specifications. These alpha specifications could be used for community 
experimentation and feedback to support the release of version 1 OAI-ORE 
specifications by September 2008. We are currently in discussions with 
various parties to plan how to best launch and support such 
community-based experimentation.

We would like to ask you to allocate some time in the course of 
October-November 2007 to review the drafts specifications, and to engage 
in constructive discussions aimed at meeting a public release date of 
the end of 2007.  Your input and feedback is essential to the success of 
this effort.  We will open up a blog for these discussions.

Greetings

Carl &amp; Herbert

Draft OAI-ORE documents in preparation:

(1) The OAI-ORE Data Model: Specifies the proposed ORE model to identify 
and describe aggregations of resources for the purpose of:

- Facilitating the re-use of an aggregation and/or its aggregated resources;
- Expressing properties and relationships pertaining to aggregated 
resources;
- Referencing resources as they exist in the context of an aggregation.

(2) The OAI-ORE Vocabulary: Specifies the ORE terminology, introducing 
notions such as Resource Map, Aggregated Resource, Manifest, and 
Relationships. Also recommends existing vocabularies that can be used 
for the purpose of expressing properties and relationships pertaining to 
aggregated resources.

(3) The ORE Profile of the ATOM Syndication Format: Specifies a document 
format to describe resource aggregations based on, and fully compliant 
with the Atom syndication format [RFC4287]. It specifies a Resource Map 
Document that is an Atom Feed Document with some ORE-specific ingredients.

(4) OAI-ORE Implementation Guidelines: Provides concrete help for the 
deployment of OAI-ORE functionality, including aspects such as discovery 
of Resource Maps, choice of values for atom:id elements, examples of 
Resource Map Documents, etc.
