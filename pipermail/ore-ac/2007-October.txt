Subject: [Ore-ac] Postponed delivery of draft ORE documents
Message-ID: <47025CEB.70101@lanl.gov>

Dear

Unfortunately we will not be able to meet our self-announced deadline of
September 30th 2007 for the internal release of draft ORE
specifications. We are making steady progress, but it became clear
during an in-person meeting, last week, that we need some more time to
finalize the planned suite of documents. We are determined to deliver
those to you by October 15th 2007.

Our apologies and greetings,

Carl & Herbert
