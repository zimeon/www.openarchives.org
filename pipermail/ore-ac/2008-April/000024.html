<PRE>Dear all,

We thought you would be interested to hear that the ORE Open Meeting at 
OR2008 in Southampton was really successful. There were over 200 
participants and there was quite some excitement in the air. Also, the 
OR2008 Developers Challenge was won by a team that built a prototype 
based on ORE in less than 2 days. The presentations from the meeting 
will be posted on the ORE web site by the end of this week.

At OR2008, we also released the alpha 0.3 ORE specifications; they are 
available at <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.3/toc">http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.3/toc</A> . There are some 
significant changes compared to the 0.2 specifications, resulting from 
feedback we received, for example:

(*) Data Model: changes in the relationship between Resource Map and 
Aggregation; introduction of a solution regarding the reference in 
context; revised approach regarding nesting aggregations.

(*) Atom serialization: Significant revision of the mapping from the ORE 
Model to Atom.

(*) Introduction of an ORE Primer

(*) Introduction of a document describing implementation issues 
regarding HTTP URIs for Aggregations and Resource Maps.

(*) RDF serialization document: This document was first made available 
in alpha 0.2. It deals with RDF/XML but also RDFa that can, for example 
be used, in splash pages.

We are currently collecting further feedback, and we hope to be able to 
release beta specifications by mid May 2008.

Cheers

Carl &amp; Herbert
