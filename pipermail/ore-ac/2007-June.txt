Subject: [Ore-ac] HTML version of Compound Object document
Message-ID: <46645D37.5090904@lanl.gov>

Dear all,

An HTML version of the document "Compound Information Objects: An 
OAI-ORE Perspective" is now available at 
<http://www.openarchives.org/ore/documents/CompoundObjects-200705.html>.

(*) This document formed the basis for last week's discussions of the 
ORE TC.  The TC agreed that it would be beneficial to share this 
document with the broader community, as a means to indicate the 
direction that OAI-ORE is taking as well as to solicit feedback.

(*) You are very much encouraged to circulate the URL of this document 
via blogs etc.

We would also like to take the opportunity to point out that significant 
progress was made during the ORE TC meeting; a report is forthcoming.

Greetings

Herbert & Carl
