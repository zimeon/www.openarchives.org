Subject: [Ore-ac] ORE Specifications: New version available
Message-ID: <482F215B.9060606@lanl.gov>

Hi all,

We are quite excited to share a revised suite of ORE documents with you:

http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.9/toc

(user=ore-tc ; pass=ore-tc)

This version is the result of extensive feedback received from the 
community at the USA and UK ORE Open Meetings, and via the Google 
mailing list. This version was just announced to the ORE Technical 
Committee who will further review it in the coming days. Our plan is to 
publicly release these documents as beta ORE Specifications on June 1st 
2008.

Note that the following are not yet in place, but will be added by June 1st:
- Schematron schema for Atom Resource Maps
- Validator for Atom Resource Maps
- OCLC service for resolving HTTP Proxy URIs

Cheers

Carl & Herbert
