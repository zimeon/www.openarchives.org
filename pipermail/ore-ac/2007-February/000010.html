<PRE>I'm not really sure what to add to this; the document indicates a very 
productive meeting, and I congratulate the TC for their hard work.

There is much to hash out in order for this to be practical. I think 
that more specific use-cases are required, and in particular more 
&quot;atomic&quot; use cases that are decoupled from the scholarly workflow 
context. An example of this might be harvesting from heterogeneous 
sources (Carl, this is my &quot;LabSpace&quot; idea).

I'm a bit troubled by some of the specifics at the end, e.g. using 
Connotea, etc. But if the group is happy, then I have nothing to say...

Finally, I feel that there is much room for grass-roots experimentation, 
which &quot;the process&quot; should somehow encourage. For example, we (HPLabs) 
are quiet willing to hack away will strawman versions/demonstrators.

Enough for now (in meeting...)
