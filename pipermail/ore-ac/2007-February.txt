I'm not really sure what to add to this; the document indicates a very 
productive meeting, and I congratulate the TC for their hard work.

There is much to hash out in order for this to be practical. I think 
that more specific use-cases are required, and in particular more 
"atomic" use cases that are decoupled from the scholarly workflow 
context. An example of this might be harvesting from heterogeneous 
sources (Carl, this is my "LabSpace" idea).

I'm a bit troubled by some of the specifics at the end, e.g. using 
Connotea, etc. But if the group is happy, then I have nothing to say...

Finally, I feel that there is much room for grass-roots experimentation, 
which "the process" should somehow encourage. For example, we (HPLabs) 
are quiet willing to hack away will strawman versions/demonstrators.

Enough for now (in meeting...)
