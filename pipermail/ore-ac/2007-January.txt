Carl and I created a draft report that is now being revised by the TC. 
As soon as that revision/approval process is complete, we will share the 
report with AC.  We expect that to be in the course of next week.

It was a very constructive meeting, BTW.

cheers

herbert

John,

Thanks for your interest.  As Herbert says, we'll get something out next week
that I think you'll find interesting.

Carl

Message-ID: <45B83631.7020606@lanl.gov>

Dear all,

(1) In attach you will find the report of the recent OAI-ORE TC meeting, 
as OK-ed by the TC.  We hope that you will find the time to have a close 
look at it, and we are very much looking forward to your feedback to the 
thinking that emerged from the 2-day meeting.

(2) We think it would be good to make this report available via a public 
link on the OAI-ORE web site, and we would like to do so on Wednesday 
January 31st.  With this respect, we would like to kindly ask you:

(a) To let us know if you think this is a bad idea.

(b) To inform us if you feel that enhancements to the report are 
necessary before public release.

Cheers

Carl & Herbert
