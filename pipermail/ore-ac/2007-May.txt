Subject: [Ore-ac] OAI-ORE presentation at OAI5, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland
Message-ID: <463768C1.4040105@lanl.gov>

Dear all

We thought you might be interested in the presentation about OAI-ORE 
given at the recent OAI5 Workshop which took place at CERN, Geneva, 
Switzerland.

The presentation gives an insight regarding the problem domain in which 
ORE operates, and in the evolving thinking regarding potential solutions.

The presentation was recorded on video and is available for both 
streaming and download at:

<http://indico.cern.ch/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=3&sessionId=14&confId=5710>

We would also like to mention that Michael Nelson did similar 
presentations on behalf of the ORE effort at the recent CNI Task Force 
meeting and at the DLF Forum:

Subject: [Ore-ac] revised version of Compound Information Object document
Message-ID: <465458C6.6000203@lanl.gov>

Dear all,

In preparation of next week's in-person meeting of the ORE Technical 
Committee, we have prepared a thoroughly revised version of the document 
"Compound Information Objects: The OAI-ORE Perspective", which we shared 
with you a while ago.

As a matter of fact, this is really a completely reworked version, 
introducing a new perspective to look at the compound object problem 
(named graphs), and detailing the issues that require resolution in 
order for OAI-ORE to be able to build an interoperability layer based on 
that perspective.

This document, along with reports of experiments conducted by sub-groups 
of the ORE Technical Committee form the basic input for next week's meeting.

As always, your feedback is very much appreciated.

Greetings

Herbert and Carl
