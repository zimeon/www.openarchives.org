Dear OAI-ORE Advisory Committee member:

 

We'd like to bring you up to date on a few OAI-ORE developments:

 

1.	We now have an updated web site for the Open Archives Initiative at
http://www.openarchives.org <http://www.openarchives.org/> .  This page
properly forks the OAI into its two branches OAI-PMH and OAI-ORE.  Let us
know if you have any comments on this site.  
2.	While you are at the site, you might want to check out your listing
on the AC at http://www.openarchives.org/ore/ORE_Community.php#AC.  Please
let us know if we have listed your name or affiliation incorrectly. Also, we
have tried to link your name to either your home page or other appropriate
link.  Let us know if you want us to change the link
3.	You might also want to look at the membership of the other
committees, Technical Committee and Liaison Group, at
http://www.openarchives.org/ore/ORE_Community.php.  We are excited at the
combination of expertise we have brought together in our effort.
4.	Finally, we have set up special private pages for both the AC
(http://www.openarchives.org/ore/ac, userid/password oaioreac) and TC
(http://www.openarchives.org/ore/tc, userid/password oaioretc).  The AC pages
have no content at this point, but you might want to glance at the TC page to
see about preparations for the upcoming January 11,12 Technical Committee
meeting.

 

As always, thanks for your time and attention.  Let us know if you have any
questions.

 

Carl and Herbert.

Subject: [Ore-ac] OAI-ORE presentation at CNI 2006
Message-ID: <A70557C8AAEABC45A0FDF4AF76AAB00B7A9C60@EXCHANGE1.cs.cornell.edu>

Hello AC members,

 

We recently presented a project briefing at the CNI Fall Task Force meeting
<http://www.cni.org/tfms/2006b.fall/index.html> .  A pdf version of the
slides is available at
http://www.openarchives.org/ore/documents/ORE-CNI-2006.pdf.  

 

Over the next couple of weeks we will be distributing a white paper that
builds on the ideas in these slides.  This will provide some strawman ideas
for the upcoming TC meeting in January.

 

As always, your feedback and questions are welcome.

 

Carl and Herbert
