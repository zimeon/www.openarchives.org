Apologies for cross-posting

A meeting will be held on April 4, 2008 at the University of
Southampton, in conjunction with Open Repositories 2008, to roll-out the
beta release of the OAI-ORE specifications. This meeting is the
European follow-on to a meeting that will be held in the USA on March 3,
2008 at Johns Hopkins University.

The OAI-ORE specifications describe a data model to identify and
describe aggregations of web resources, and they introduce
machine-readable formats to describe these aggregations based on ATOM
and RDF/XML. The current, alpha version of the OAI-ORE specifications  
is at http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.1/ .
