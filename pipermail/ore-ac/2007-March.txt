Hi,

Sorry to be so slow to reply - I thought the report was quite good.  
The one comment I have is whether, in section 4.10 on the last page,  
there should be a fourth class of transaction called something like  
"Verify" which would allow someone to verify the correctness of their  
copy of an ORE Resource they have previously harvested (digital  
signature, checksum, etc.).

Best regards,
Mark

I think this should be of interest to this group:

SPARQL/Update: A language for updating RDF graphs
     Andy Seaborne, Hewlett-Packard <andy.seaborne@hp.com>
     Geetha Manjunath, Hewlett-Packard <geetha.manjunath@hp.com>
     Version 1 : 2007-03-09

This document describes SPARQL/Update (nicknamed "SPARUL"), an update 
language for RDF graphs. It uses a syntax derived form SPARQL. Update 
operations are performed on a collection of graphs in a Graph Store. 
Operations are provided to change existing RDF graphs as well as create 
and remove graphs with the Graph Store.

A binding of SPARQL/Update using HTTP POST is described.
