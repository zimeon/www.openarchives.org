Now that Alex has set up sharepoint for us (thanks Alex!) i realize  
how much duplication there is between it and the TRAC server we've set  
up at Cornell - lesson, never doubt the power of the world's largest  
software company ;-)

The question is, should we retain both, and if only one, which one?   
Frankly, it seems silly to have two sources of project info and share  
point seems to cover TRAC functionality - wiki, revision storage  
system.  I am therefore partial to dropping the TRAC system.

Please let me know your opinion.

Carl,

I did see this coming, but figured there were some agendas that had to be played out!

I played around with both environments this morning a bit more and  
agree with Jim Downing's evaluation. Sharepoint works great if all of  
us are committed to operating within Internet Explorer environment.  
However, as soon as you move to another browser or into another  
operating system other than Windows its functionality starts to  
degrade. For example the wiki, which has a really nice WYSIWYG  
interface in Internet Explorer, is almost impossible to use in Firefox  
or Safari. The same is true with the revision system and sharing  
system for office documents. It works great on Windows office, has no  
functionality on Mac office. So, given that a number of us work  
outside the Windows domain on both Linux and Macs I think we should  
stay with TRAC, which seems to have lesser functionality but is  
browser agnostic. Thanks for other peoples comments and help on this.

I confess that I have not tested this myself, but I have gone by the browser support doc here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288142.aspx which suggests that the experience is downgraded on FireFox 1.5 (for Linux and Mac) and Safari 2.0 (Mac) but that it is still possible to use all of the functionality (save some admin tasks).

So, with the wiki example, is it that you cannot edit it at all, or just that the WYSIWYG experience is not there?

I will look into the Mac Office support.

Hi all:

Time moves along and the time of our all-project face-2-face meeting  
is approaching.  Just to remind you that meeting is scheduled for  
March 28-29 on the Microsoft campus in Redmond (exact location to be  
announced).  We will start early afternoon on March 28, go to a joint  
dinner that evening (Lee and/or Alex, please delight us with a  
wonderful cuisine recommendation), and then meet all day on Sunday  
until the reception for the MS research meeting.  Please make  
reservations in consideration of this.

My main agenda item for this meeting is the joint data model we will  
work with.  A number of us have been working "behind the  
scenes" (stuff is up on the wiki) on this.  Since so much is dependent  
on this we really need to come to some agreement on this.  Therefore,  
I am willing to occupy almost all the meeting on this since face-to- 
face interaction on these types of design issues is so effective.   
However, I am open to more suggestions.

Also, as you know we have scheduled month-to-month all-project phone  
conferences.  I have put up a Doodle poll for times.  Please sign up  
as soon as possible.

Regards,

Carl

Carl,
I was thinking perhaps to add two quick items to your agenda for the 3/28-29 meeting: 

 - A presentation and work-in-progress demo of the "Chem4Word" project [Peter Murray-Rust + Alex Wade]
 - A quick demo of the ORE functionality we are integrating into Word 2007 [Pablo Fernicola] 

I think quick walk-throughs of this work would be useful for all to see.

We should plan to meet in Building 99 on the Microsoft campus.
-jld

P.S. - I'll get working on those dinner reservations!

hi all:

I am sending this out to the general list even though only a few of  
you have indicated your availability for this call. We will once again  
be using yuuguu for the call, please note that the call-in number and  
code will be displayed in your yuuguu client when you connect to me.  
yuuguu should know what country you are in so that it gives you the  
proper call in number, but if it doesn't get this right, you can set  
your country and your individual profile. My identity, as before, is  
clagoze. Please e-mail me if you have any questions about this  
procedure.

I have spent the morning reading papers from the Southhampton group  
about their RDF modeling and from the Cambridge group about CML.  
Clearly, and as we have discussed before, we want to make use of this  
work and somehow integrated with my work on OAI-ORE. We had some  
proposals in our previous call on how to integrate it with CML, but we  
have yet to discuss how to make use of the RDF model from Cambridge.  
Simon, if you can think a little bit about this for the call and speak  
about it that would be great.

By the way, looking at the wiki I see that a number of queries have  
been listed in the compound centric modeling section, but none have  
been listed in the document centric modeling section. I believe the  
Penn State folks were going to put something here, if you can do that  
before the phone call that would be great.

Talk to you in approximately 45 minutes.

Carl

All,
My apologies for the delay in forwarding this - I was under the impression this link had already been sent around!

As I understand it, you will have to make two separate reservations: we were able to get a different (far cheaper) rate for 3/26 - 3/29 if you use the link below - but then you'll have to make separate arrangements through the ER Symposium website for thru 3/30-4/1.   Let me know if this doesn't make sense or you have any questions/problems...

Amazon Exposes 1 Terabyte of Public Data to Developers
Written by Marshall Kirkpatrick / February 25, 2009 5:26 AM / 15  
Comments ? Prior Post Next Post ?
Amazon.com changed the retail world. In the process the company built  
up so much surplus computing power that it started a dirt cheap  
"computing in the cloud" business that changed the computing world.  
This week the company's newest project Public Data Sets on Amazon Web  
Services began offering more than 1 Terabyte (1000 GB) of fascinating  
public data for developers to access on the fly through Amazon's cloud  
computing service.

We're talking about an annotated collection of all publicly available  
DNA sequences, including the Human Genome, huge amounts of chemistry  
data, machine readable encyclopedic entries about millions of  
different topics and an entire dump of Wikipedia. US Census data, data  
from the US Department of Transportation and more. It's all accessible  
by web applications in no time at all. What do you think this is going  
to change?

The company made a blog post last night announcing the availability of  
four new public data sets.

This includes data from:
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

DBPedia Knowledge Base - which "currently describes more than 2.6  
million things including 213,000 people, 328,000 places, 57,000 music  
albums, 36,000 films, and 20,000 companies." All in handy semantic  
markup.

The Freebase Data Dump - the giant collaboratively build semantic  
database on a wide variety of topics, data that high profile startup  
Metaweb has spent millions of dollars assembling.

The entire English section of Wikipedia, dumped into a machine  
readable format.

A number of large genetic and scientific databases.
We counted all the databases up and it passed 1 TB of available data.  
The company says that accessing this data is "trivial" for developers.

What are developers going to do with this data? We can't wait to find  
out. The prospect of mashing up, cross referencing and user  
interfacing with this amount of data is nearly unfathomable. Really.  
This data will be leveraged by all kinds of different web  
applications, for a long time.

You've read, or can imagine, the impact that the first Public  
Libraries had on human culture. Now imagine the opening up of not just  
this, but other libraries of data, so huge that economies of scale  
blast the project off beyond any analogy that could be drawn with our  
everyday experience or historical memories. It won't just be Amazon  
that offers up this kind of data - it will be relatively commonplace  
soon, we imagine.

It will be like a network of libraries - for robots. Robots that go to  
the library frequently, read very fast and make serious use of what  
they've learned.

Congratulations, Amazon, on passing 1 TB of public data made  
available. May all our robots of the future please live in peace.

Are you sure its 1TB? Just Wikipedia by itself would make up a  
significant chunk of that space, and since it includes dbpedia (thus  
duplicating most content)... Terabytes are cheap these days. I have  
two TB of data just on my home desktop PC.

Posted by: Nate | February 25, 2009 7:47 AM



You apparently have to have an EC2 account and active instance to be  
able to get access to the data, so for the mean time there is a cost  
attached to getting hold of the data.

Posted by: Stuart Marsh | February 25, 2009 8:13 AM



to be honest marshall - you might change that title - when i saw it i  
thought "oh my amazon just got hacked and my info is public!"

not sure if others got the same idea

Posted by: Allen | February 25, 2009 8:22 AM



Amazon is a 'Cloud' Pioneer and I appreciate them for offering these  
datasets to the public. They have a potential to have a huge impact.

I recommend that there be a public information release on how often  
Amazon plans to update these files.
Posted by: Tecue | February 25, 2009 8:59 AM



To be honest, I thought the title was speaking of a vulnerability as  
well. Had to read the article twice to make the connection.

And I'm a user of AWS as well.

Isn't terrabyte is supposed to be spelled terabyte?

Posted by: Bob Ohsiek | February 25, 2009 9:33 AM



Bob - thank you, you are the only real friend I have!

Allen - I would have thought the words "customer data" would have  
given you that impression. But I'll edit the headline.

Posted by: Marshall Kirkpatrick  | February 25, 2009 9:44 AM



Same comment about the title. "Releases" or "Publishes" instead of  
"Exposes" would be less confusing maybe

Posted by: Ozh | February 25, 2009 10:29 AM



It's great that Amazon is making all of this data available via EC2  
but the data has always been available for developers that were so  
inclined to use it.

These are public data sets already distributed by the respective  
organizations - from what I can tell this is just clustered to add  
value to Amazon's Web Service offerings.

Anyone have any sense on whether Amazon did work to mark these up  
better, cross reference them, or added any particular value besides  
exposing them from within EC2?

  Posted by: Christian  | February 25, 2009 10:48 AM



Please go to http://blog.infochimps.org/2009/02/06/start-hacking-machetec2-released

It will show you which AMI you need in order to access these new  
datasets. Unfortunately, Amazon is a little light on the details in  
terms of accessing the datasets they just published.

  Posted by: Allan  | February 25, 2009 11:28 AM



Title is scary, but after reading it, feel much better now.

Rex

Posted by: Rex Dixon | February 25, 2009 11:58 AM



Yes, boo to the misleading page title.

Posted by: exposer | February 25, 2009 1:30 PM



This system should provide a lot of good fodder to make some  
interesting mashups. Heck you could probably build an entire self- 
contained system just using Amazon products exclusively at this point:
-this service for the raw input
-EC2 and S3 for crunching and storing data
-Mechanical Turk for recognizing patterns in the output analysis

On another note, coincidentally today we released the JumpBox for  
SnapLogic which is essentially an Open Source "Yahoo Pipes" system. I  
recorded a demo video that helps people get started with it. You don't  
have to be a developer anymore to make mashups:

I understood what he meant from the headline immediately... "expose"  
has a bad rap, apparently. Published, released, etc would be  
inaccurate- Amazon is only providing easy access to the info which is  
freely available elsewhere. "Expose" is exactly the right word for that.

  Posted by: Evan  | February 25, 2009 2:17 PM



Totally read the same thing. I thought for sure, and had to do a  
triple take, that Amazon had been hacked.

But, no, this is VERY VERY interesting.

And not at all frightening like the usual digital security issues that  
we are bombarded with each and every day.

You ever read http://www.justaskgemalto.com? Anyway, it's not fun.

But yes, the cloud is very interesting.

Sorry for the flurry of messages. The mail list got backed up, I just  
unclog it resulting in you receiving two messages with somewhat  
contradictory information. Just to clarify, our all group conference  
call will be Thursday, March 5 1500 GMT -5 (US Eastern time).

Alex and Lee Dirks, I know that neither of you will be able to make  
this call. Sorry about that, but it is the only time that all of the  
rest of us could get together. Can you please issue a conference call  
number for the call.

Thanks, Carl

Rajarshi Guha at IU contributed his Pub3d data sets. These are 3d structures derived from PubChem.  I wrote in developing EBS-like systems in open source cloud software in our deliverables, so we'll be looking into this.
