Subject: [Orechem] Request for talk materials
Message-ID: <53C34EB0-0436-4C79-A3B9-4496F05C8271@gmail.com>

Hi all:

On March 19 I am giving a talk at the Web Science Conference in Athens  
on our project: "Integrating chemistry project with the semantic  
web".  I'd like to integrate some materials from you.  I will then use  
this as the basis of a talk at the MS Research Symposium after our  
meeting at the end of March.  Please think about this and I'll put it  
on the agenda for the call this week.

Thanks,

Carl

Great! It would be nice if you reported on this when we meet at the  
end of March. We probably should evaluate what is available here as a  
group and see if any of it is usable.

We are not using yuuguu this time around, since I am not anticipating  
the need for screen sharing.  Just the conf call number sent in the  
previous message.

Hi:

Some Important Things:

1.  A preliminary agenda is up at http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/03052009 
.  Please add to it if you wish
2. The main order of discussion is the data model.  I have organized  
our initial work on this.  Please take a moment and look at them:  http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/DataModel


3. The UK people alerted me to the fact that the conf call number I  
gave out is a US number.  Our provider at Cornell does not have  
international numbers.  Therefore,  I have decided to use yuuguu  
conference calling, since it does have a UK number.  For Jane it  
doesn't have an Australian number but it does have a skype out number.

The added advantage to this is that we can screen share

Please follow the following instructions:

Peter, Jane, Jeremy, Jim, Karl, Mark, Nico, Prasenjit, and Simon: I  
already have you in my contact list.  Please go online 5 minutes  
before the call and let me add you in.  I need to do the initiation to  
form the group.  Then you will get the common call in code.

Everyone else (Geoffrey, Marlon, Lee GIles, Lee Dirks, Alex):  do the  
following (takes about 5 minutes):

1. Download and install the yuuguu client from yuuguu.com (it runs on  
linux, windows, mac)
2. Start up the client and get an ID to connect to yuuguu (you should  
now have a window that looks like:
3. Once you are on you will need to find me and invite me.
   a. Hit the "Find Contacts link" in the yuuguu main window
   b. Leave the "I will enter the email addresses myself" button on
   c. Enter my email address "clagoze@gmail.com" in the text box
   d. Hit the "NEXT>" button
   e. You now should see a screen confirming you want to add me (leave  
me checked)
   f.  Hit the "NEXT>" button
   g. Another confirmation
   h. Hit the "FINISH" button
   i. I will then get an invite from you.  Once I accept you will see  
me as a contact in your main yuuguu window.
   j. I will add you to the group chat when we begin the meeting.
   k. You will then get a message from me (a small window) - hit "REPLY"
   l. a chat window will popup - there will be a phone number and PIN  
for the conf call in it (if it is the wrong country hit the county  
name and you will be able to set your locale.  (also conf call numbers  
are here http://www.yuuguu.com/pricing/conference-calling - use the  
PIN in your chat window.

IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS EMAIL ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OR  
CALL ME: +1-607-229-4330.

I see that the chemists in the group indicated several compound centric
queries but no document centric queries.  So, should I conclude that 
chemists do not usually try to search for documents but prefer to search
via
chemicals?

"All your papers are belong to us" (Am. Chem. Soc)

Chemists prefer to pay ACS to show them what and how to search rather 
than search themselves. If we try to download and index chemical 
documents we will probably get lawyers' letters...

Hi all,

I may not be there at today's phone meeting, but, I wanted to discuss the
following.  I think Karl Mueller will be there from Penn State and I will
talk to him afterwards to find out what was discussed.  I am giving some
of my na?ve/preliminary thoughts below.

In general, it does not make sense to talk about classes and properties
separately.  We should specify in the model which classes have which 
properties. 
 
By looking at the queries and the data model, I realize that we cannot 
answer most of the queries if with the preliminary data model that we have.

Query 1:  [Show me all compounds ... bind ... sub-structure]
Are we entering the sub-structure via drawing or via SMILES, etc.?
Is there a program that can be called to find out what substructures bind to
what compounds?  Or do we need to implement it?

Query 2: [ ... all papers ... compounds ... bind ... sub-structure]
We run 1, then, find the answers and try to find those compounds in the 
papers.  Can be done more optimally than that, perhaps.  If Query 1 can be
answered, this should be easy.

Query 3: [ ... spectral data ... acetic acid][NMR spectral data ... acetic acid ... Brucker spectrometer]
We need each dataset to have the type of data they are associated with.
** Add attribute to dataset class **.
To answer the last part, we need to ** add attribute "equipment-type" to 
the dataset class. And attribute "methods" or "experiment type" to dataset class.** 

I did not get exactly what the query was and what the expected answers were
in this part.  Can someone please elaborate it a bit more on what exactly
the queries are and what should be the expected answers?

" Entities required in the model (most are covered by Carl's previous examples):

chemical reactivity maps or tables (reactome ?)
the reactome to me means a table of compounds (probably with thermodynamic and - more difficult - kinetic rate data) that have known or predicted chemical reactivity with a compound (or sub structure)

tables of spectral data (peak lists with intensities) - specific datasets
correlations in multidimensional spectra - more specific datasets
experimental chemical methods and instrumentation
computational chemical methods, programs/environments, and instrumentation"

We should start drawing class-attribute graphs/hierarchies and editing them
so that we have some starting point for the face to face meetings at the
end of this month.

Best Regards,
Prasenjit

Subject: [Orechem] A reminder about slide for me
Message-ID: <309DDD09-E6D6-40CE-8CF6-AC39EE747005@gmail.com>

As I said in our call, I am giving a talk at WebSci'09 (http://www.websci09.org/ 
) on March 19.  I need from each group one slide about your work  
relevant to the project.  Please send it to me in powerpoint so I can  
manipulate it.  The overall message I want to get across in the talk is:

-  How the Web, Semantic Web, and Linked Data can be used to  
facilitate changes in the research practices in a discipline - in this  
case Chemistry
-  How the notion of linkages among the units of information (text,  
data, code, etc.), participants (authors, labs, universities), and  
other artifacts of a field (compounds, experiments, etc.) are  
important in this
- How being able to aggregate these related entities into  bounded,  
nameable units (OAI-ORE) is important to this by creating "things to  
which we can refer", and facilitating objet-center sociality.

Any way you can tailor your slides into those themes (you don't have  
to address them specifically, thats my job) would be great.

By next Wednesday March 11 please.  If you feel it appropriate to send  
me a paragraph explaining the slide, please do

Thanks,

Carl

Again, this is done with Amazon EBS.  The TripleStore may also be a good 
candidate for this--would be a way to distribute copies of the 
triplestore as an attachable virtual disk.

I have posted examples of our chemical properties in RDF and in CML - 
they are discoverable through the Cambridge link on the Wiki. Note that 
the actual chemical structures (atoms, bonds) are held in CML, 
everything else can be managed through RDF.

I recently posted some RDF to the Wiki. RDF is pretty turgid for bedtime 
  reading and I wondered if we have a method for visualising it 
communally on the wiki.

Currently it's possible to paste RDF into the W3C RDF Validator and get 
a graph, but that expands all URIs so it's almost unreadable.

Ideally we should have a project service that one can drop some RDF into 
and it makes a nice picture (like the nice pictures in the ORE specs) 
automatically. It would be real cool if this could identify the 
different namespaces and paint them different colours, especially the 
ORE protoagonists...

If we are intending to impress the world (and it's certainly in my 
ambitions) then a pretty RDF browser would be useful.

I completely agree with Peter - we use the visualizer from Simile but it is far from ideal.  We have also experimented with using RDFa, for example drawing tables of data and being bale to view the underlying RDF but this is not the same as a graph view.

A good system would be an excellent project deliverable.

I have posted an overview page on our software at:

http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/CambridgeSoftware

We shall be bringing at least this to the meeting and hope that 
collaborators will come with platforms on which it can be installed. Our 
intention is to give collaborators enough instruction that ther can have 
a system which will convert legacy chemistry files into CML and thence 
to RDF. The basic requirement is a Java 1.6 installation, preferably SDK 
not JRE, SVN, and maven/Eclipse if we need to make changes. In 
production mode it shuld be possible to run these as mindless jars.

I would see this as a minimal requirement for any software in the 
project based on Java.

I would welcome indications of what systems others - e.g. Pythonistas - 
would wish to have on community platforms. There will be a limit to the 
diversity we can all support.

We clearly also need to thinks about basic RDF tools and should start 
discussing these.

I think it will be useful to have a package which contains all the 
agreed systems, along with examples files and basic docco, so that we 
can all be clear we are working in the same environment.

There are some tools which are out of scope for the complete project - 
nfor example the CambridgePSU collaboration on converting PDF2CML does 
not require every to have the converters at this stage - they are fairly 
  hairy.

Dear All,

as there seems to be a general interest in RDF visualisation tools, I  
have started a wiki page, which pulls together some tools I know about  
- please feel free to extend and amend etc...The page is linked to  
from the Chemistry in RDF Page.

Hope this helps,

I think that we should have a hackfest at Redmond on this. Getting a 
good supply of high-quality molecules must be an important target.

There are a number of positive threads:

  OPSIN
  =====
  Daniel Lowe (copied) is a first year PhD student in Cambridge and he 
has been making excellent progress with OPSIN (our IUPAC-like 
name2structure converter). It is always difficult to give accurate 
metrics as there are no gold standards, no corpora, no annotation 
guidelines for name2structure. (This does not stop a number of software 
houses making unmeasurable claims for their software.) Given these 
reservations we believe that OPSIN can give good conversion rates on 
Pubchem IUPAC names for organic compounds (up to ca 80%, although some 
corpora give considerably lower values). [Note that there are roughly 3 
approaches to name2structure:
     - lexical lookup. This is the only way for trivial names but 
suffers from synonymy and lexical variants.
     - interpretation of IUPAC-like names. IUPAC-like means that a human 
or program has tried to follow some of the IUPAC rules. An example is 
1-iodo-2-chloro-ethane. It's interpretable by machine.
     - semi-systematic names: 2-chloro-testosterone. You have to know 
what "testosterone" and its numbering system is.
  The errors in conversion (i.e. it manages to get an answer but this is 
wrong) are lower (ca 1%) than most other systems.

OPSIN is Open Source at Sourceforge.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/oscar3-chem/

  OSCAR
  =====
  OSCAR is our chemical entity recognition and extraction software for 
textual documents. OSCAR recognizes chemical names in text (ca 80-85% F1 
according to corpus). OMII/ENGAGE are working with us to refactor OSCAR 
over the next 3 months. OSCAR emits confidence scores for recognized 
entities. OSCAR uses dictionary lookup combined with MEMM and other methods.

We can also extract recipes into a a recipe ontology.

OSCAR is Open Source at Sourceforge.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/oscar3-chem/

  SVG2CML
  =======
  This is my code for converting SVG to chemical concepts. (The PDF is 
generated from PDF by, say, ps2edit which Bill put me onto or from WMF) 
The system can currently extract molecules in CML from vectors/text and 
extract spectra from vectors/text. It relies on born digital vectors 
which are much more tractable than OCR'ed vectors. Currently I suspect 
about 20-25% of J.Org.Chem supplemental data is highly tractable.

=========

Last week I had a useful visit to the SCAI Fraunhofer Institute in Sankt 
Augustin where the bioinformatics group has several initiatives on 
extraction of chemistry from documents. Our main thrust was 
name2structure and it's clear that this depends considerably on source. 
OCR'ed names often contain whitespace and grot (1(one) vs l(ell), etc.). 
SCAI has put effort into dealing with whitespace - unfortunately most of 
their SW in not re-distributable.

They have also been working on OCRed vectors to chemistry (ChemOCR). OCR 
has many disadvantages against born-digital - apart from the 1/l and O/0 
stuff you cannot rely on knowing whether test is horizontally aligned , 
vectors actually meet, etc. They clearly had additional loss in conversion.

Summary
=======

Chemistry has a data drought and holders of data are not likely to let 
us have it without hairy legal negotiations. I see the following 
mainstream resources of substantial chemical data (as opposed to general 
metadata such as CiteSeer already extracts):
  * crystallography (from suppkemental CIFs)
  * organic recipes from supplemental text. Error rates will be ca 5-20% 
I think.
  * Organic structures from vectors in suppkemental data. Recall will be 
ca. 25-50% (too many bitmaps and other grot). But errors should be low 
(< 10%)
  * organic structures from names in supplemental data. I'm guessing 
about 50-70% recal and 95% accuracy of conversion.

I suggest that we create a clear chemistry data extraction project for 
synthetic organic chemistry. I think most of the current s/w has been 
created at Cambridge and PSU. I think ORE will be a key tool (see next 
post).

Message-ID: <49B39253.4010607@cam.ac.uk>

Following Bill and my initial excursions into chemistry extraction I'd 
like to suggest we devote some time to sketching out an ORE design for 
supporting this process.

I think that the confluence of groups and technology in this project 
jumps us ahead of the world in what is an area of great interest. It is 
also clear that unless it is supported by an ontological approach it 
won't succeed - most of what is currently done is trivial and messy 
(lexical identification of potential chemicals (NER) and conversion to 
"structures" (N2S)). Although this works OK for sub branches of 
chemistry it's broken for large areas. A major problem is that it does 
not distinguish between molecules and substances and sub-problems are 
that some substances are mutatble and heterogeneous. Although Pubchem 
has a well designed approached most databases (e.g. Chemspider) are 
confounded by this fallacy. Although ChEBI is a worthy first essay at a 
lexicon/thesaurus for chemistry its ontology is recognized to be broken.

I suggest we concentrate on high-throughput extraction of information 
reported for organic chemical syntheses.

It has the advantages that it's important, tractable and has a good 
implicit ontology. In essence a reported synthesis combines the following:
  * a target "molecule" M with a connection table (graph) G
  * Properties (P1...Pn) of a substance S
  * an assertion that S is composed of many identical Ms.
  * assertions that observations O1...On are consistent with expected 
properties P1...Pn of M (usually spectroscopic). It is normally 
difficult to predict properties of S reliably.
  * a recipe (P) for making M from M0, M1 ... under conditions C0, C1... 
using reaction R.

In general M, G and R are unknown or unreported and only accessible 
through their data and metadata and linguistic environment.

In such a report there is both ambiguity and redundancy. It is therefore 
critical to use ontological methods including not only provenance but 
also confidence.

There is almost never a clear statement of the connection table (graph 
G) of M. This may change if journals include InChIs. In the absence of G 
we can deduce it from:
  * a crystal structure X (very high confidence, but probably only 5% 
occurrence).
  * a chemical name N. I am hoping somewhere in the region 50-70% recall 
and 98% accuracy
  * a vector diagram V of the connection table G. I expect ca 25% recall 
and 95% accuracy.
  * the spectroscopic properties (P0...Pn) This is a common 
undergradutae exercise for simply molecules.

This information should contain redundancy and, in good cases will 
reinforce each other. In others it allows us to make good guesses about 
M-C which are further constrained by P0...Pn and R. A typical example of 
constraints in R is "M1 was treated with acetic anhydride to give M2". 
This would normally add one or more Acetyl groups (CH3-C(=O)-) to the 
structure, each adding C2H2O to the formula). Thus even if we didn't 
know the structure of M0 or M1 but did know their formulae we could see 
if they were consistent. Similarly we would expect acetyl groups in the 
NMR and IR spectra of the M2.

All this gives us a very exciting area indeed in which to apply 
ontologies. Nico Adams (copied) has created the tools which can support 
this. We propose that PSU and Cambridge create a system to extract N, X, 
V, C, O, P from  thousands of current published syntheses and to attempt 
to deduce their "structures" (G). Where that can be done we can also try 
to extract R (as CML).

We shall need to agree a means of adding confidence to our triples. 
Later we shall need a means of chaining these confidences.

We should not underestimate the difficulty of getting a transportable 
and re-usable workflow for this. Probably the main problem is the 
heterogenity of the tools - PSU is very UNIX-oriented - Cambridge tends 
to use a Java framework. Tools like ps2edit may have platform-dependent 
problems and anything to do with PDF is a nightmare...

First, thanks all for getting me slides to help with my Athens talk.   
I'm still preparing that.

I have put the one slide that Alex requested of me for the MS all- 
hands meeting.  I have put it up on our sharepoint server (Alex sent  
info about this a month or so ago).  The slide is up there (orechem- 
ms.ppt) along with all your contributed slides.  BTW, if you haven't  
notice sharepoint access from IE (windows) is really the only  
functional way.

Also, haven't gotten a slide from PSU folks - hint, hint.

Carl, I concede that uploading individual slides to the slide library (and composing a new presentation from slide on the site) can only be done with IE.  As penance, I have uploaded the individual slides, so they can now be browsed via the "Slides" link on the right nave pane.

But I take issue with your assertion that this limitation renders the site non-functional. The site, and the slide decks are still accessible in other browsers (I tested Chrome and FF just now), I can upload docs, decks, I can edit wiki pages, etc.  What issues are you (or others) experiencing with the site using non-IE browsers?

I'm not familiar with this, so if anyone has advice on running, please

* I'm using standard JVM settings. Should I increase heap size and so on?

* I'm running this using the built-in Jetty server. Is this OK, or

Hi All;

I've taken the chemistry extraction from supplemental data about as far as I
can, without being privy to the data model. All the details and files are here
-> http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/ChemistryDataExtraction

I'm narrowing in on some permanent positions, so sadly I will have to sign off
from oreChem... It's been a real pleasure getting to meet & work with you,
particularly Peter. Good luck with the rest of the project and please don't
hesitate
to email me with any questions, I know my shell scripts read like Joyce

all the best,

Hi all:

I will be sending out a detailed agenda by the end of the week, but  
here is a reminder of our starting and ending times for our meeting  
March 28,29 in Redmond.

Saturday March 28 - 1PM - 5PM (then dinner together)
Sunday March 29 - 9AM - 5PM (start of MS opening reception)

The meeting will be in Building B9 at MS.  Quoting Lee's recent note  
to me:

He will send around a mail to the attendees specifying:
?         Location + map of the meetings in Microsoft Building 99
?         Basic instructions on how to get there from the hotel on  
foot (it is close enough to walk)
?         Plans for  dinner on Saturday night.    (Perhaps even some  
options for people to vote on.)

I will be arriving at SEA at 11:20AM.  I can be reached at  
607-229-4330 if you have any questions.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Carl

Hi all

I'll be visiting for the meeting (and ER conference) as a member of Jane
Hunter's eResearch Group at The University Queensland.

I've been working with the Structural Genomics group at UQ, and have
developed a laboratory information management system for capturing
experiment data (eg cloning, expression, purification, crystallisation).
I have also started developing a diffraction image archive as part of
the <http://tardis.edu.au/> project, with the aim of exposing datasets
using ORE. The ultimate aim is to also use ORE for linking between
objects in these systems, with further linking to PDB, PubMed, etc.

You can find notes about our research at
<http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/UniOfQld>.

> Here are three (3) dinner options for Saturday night.  Please have a

> An Irish-Cajun pub.  (Yes, I?m serious.)
> 
> *Matt?s Rotisserie* (http://mattsrotisserie.com/ ?
> A bit more upscale seafood establishment ? known for its oysters.

My vote is for either of the first two (I'm not that into seafood).

Looking forward to meeting you all on Saturday...

Later
Charlie

Message-ID: <ED0ACCE1-21D3-4205-906E-995EFDACA3DF@gmail.com>

Hi all:

I'd like to split up the meeting as follows:

Saturday  (1-5PM)
  - status reports
  - realignment of our project schedule and collaboration methods.   
We've had a lot of moving of dates and now that we are fully in gear I  
want to make sure we have solid, agreed upon, reachable goals. These  
should be recorded on the Wiki after we settle on them

Sunday (9-5)
   - My main priority for this day is a heads-down working session to  
settle on a data model.  We absolutely need this to push our work  
forward.  Please review the wiki pages.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or questions.  BTW, I have  
asked for a working lunch to be ready for us when we start on Saturday.

Looking forward to seeing you all.

Carl

Marlon,
If you are not renting a car (or hitchhiking!), there are only two options to get to the Courtyard Marriott from SeaTac airport, either (1) by taxi = $50-$60 or (2) by Shuttle Express = less than $50, but call for specifics -- http://www.shuttleexpress.com/index.html

On Sat & Sun, we'll be meeting at Microsoft Building 99 - in Meeting Room 4800.   Map and directions: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/redmond/visit.aspx

This is a short ~10 minute walk from http://www.marriott.com/hotels/fact-sheet/travel/bvuch-courtyard-seattle-bellevue-redmond/

I'll send a more detailed mail shortly.  If you have ANY questions after arrival, don't hesitate to call my mobile phone (425-985-7088) with questions or for suggestions!

I'm arriving in Seattle at 11:00 Saturday, staying at Courtyard Marriott.  Two questions:

- Is there a preferred way to get to Bellvue/Redmond?  I'm not renting a car.

- Where do we meet on Saturday?  At the hotel and caravan over or on the MS campus?


My cell phone # is 812-320-0876.  I'll hold down the IU fort on Saturday; Geoffrey will be there on Sunday.

Hi all:

I will be sending out a detailed agenda by the end of the week, but here is a reminder of our starting and ending times for our meeting March 28,29 in Redmond.

Saturday March 28 - 1PM - 5PM (then dinner together)
Sunday March 29 - 9AM - 5PM (start of MS opening reception)

The meeting will be in Building B9 at MS.  Quoting Lee's recent note to me:

He will send around a mail to the attendees specifying:
*         Location + map of the meetings in Microsoft Building 99
*         Basic instructions on how to get there from the hotel on foot (it is close enough to walk)
*         Plans for  dinner on Saturday night.    (Perhaps even some options for people to vote on.)

I will be arriving at SEA at 11:20AM.  I can be reached at 607-229-4330 if you have any questions.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Carl

If you've packed light, the bus is also an option. I caught the 560 from 
SeaTac to the Bellevue Transit Center (3 mi from hotel). Cost is $2.50. 
 From there you can walk or catch the 253.

Subject: [Orechem] Table search in CiteSeerX

We have introduced table search into CiteSeerX. It's based on what we have
developed in ChemXSeer but is implemented on a large public search service
with over one million tables that primarily serves the computer science
community.
Currently, it only indexes tables and permits page views based on
various ranking
methods. We hope to soon include figures and extraction of data.

You can find it here:
