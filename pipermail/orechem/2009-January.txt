All,
I just wanted to provide a quick update on the progress made around signing of contracts.   Three down, two to go!


*         Cambridge = Signed (executed on 11/4/08)

*         Indiana = Signed (executed on 1/13/09)

*         Penn State = Signed (executed on 1/15/09)

*         Southampton = still pending resolution of 2-3 minor issues (and a legal staff change at Soton)

*         Cornell = still sorting out start date issue between MS & Cornell

Thanks,
-jld

Message-ID: <865399C7-6C10-4084-84FC-5246B4BB79C9@gmail.com>

Last week I sent you an e-mail saying that he would have the Trac  
server up by the end of this week. It looks like it took a little more  
effort than I had hoped for, we need to reconfigure some servers.  
However my systems administration people promised me that we'll have  
things up and running by Tuesday. I'll let you know when you can log  
on and we can start using it to run the project as a whole.

I'll also take this opportunity to remind you of our phone call at 4  
PM US Eastern time (GNT -5) next Tuesday, January 27.  I'll send call  
in information ASAP.

Things are never as easy as they seem!
But, I'm happy to say we now have a project management site at http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem 
.  You need to login to access all its features.  Each of you has your  
own login - first initial, last name.  So, Jane Hunter is jhunter,  
Simon Coles is scoles (I think you see the pattern).  Everyone has the  
same password "orechem09".  Needless, to say , use your own login and  
if someone else in your group needs access, let me know and we'll give  
them a login.  Its nice to know exactly is doing things.

As configured, everyone in the group can modify the wiki, manipulate  
tickets and reports, and view the subversion repository.  I still need  
to get my SA folks to give http access for svn operations - that will  
come soon.

You will note that I've had a quick start on wiki content. Obviously,  
much more needs to be done.  But at least we are now live.

Also, please remember our phone call at 1600 GMT-5 on January 27, 2009  
(Today for all but Jane).

I;ve been able to edit the start page (trying to make a list of 
partners) but cannot create new pages yet. (I want to make a list of our 
people and resources...)

>From the call today,  http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/48e60ac1-a95a-4163-a23d-28a914007743/
MSR's Research Output Repository Platform (codename "Famulus") aims to provide the necessary building blocks, tools, and services for developers who are tasked with creating and maintaining an organization's repository ecosystem. Furthermore, it provides an easy-to-install and maintain experience for those who want to quickly set up a research output repository for their project, team, or organization. The platform is based on Microsoft's technologies (SQL Server 2008 and .NET Framework version 3.5 SP1) hence taking advantage of their robustness, their quality support infrastructure, and the plethora of developer-focused documentation. New applications on top of the platform can be developed using any .NET language and the Visual Studio 2008 SP1 environment. The platform focuses on the management of research assets-such as people, papers, lectures, workflows, data, and tags - as well as the semantic relationships between them. Support for various services such as full-text search, OAI-PMH, RSS and Atom Syndication, BibTeX import and export, SWORD, AtomPub, and OAI-ORE are included as part of the distribution.
We will be releasing a beta 2 later next month and our v.1 release in the Spring.

This is why wiki drive me nuts!  So much easier just to write HTML ;-)

Note my entry for Cornell, which now works.  You had two problems:

1. No space before '*' - so no bulleted list.
2. link must be [wiki:Cornell Cornell] - not [/Cornell Cornell]

Try it now.

Per the call yesterday, I have set up a project SharePoint site for calendaring, document management, etc.  (and for Jeremy specifically, a Powerpoint slide library) at https://sharepoint.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/sites/eChemistry

However, I lied about the Windows Live ID bit, so I will need to create a user account for each of you.  To initiate, each of you should send me a) your telephone number and b) your preference for a user account name (by default I will use the account name from your email address, if available, so just let me know if you would like something different).

I will then create an account for you and will call you with a temporary PIN that will allow you to activate your account and to set your own password.
