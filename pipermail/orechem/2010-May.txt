It seems Mark's reply didn't reach the list, perhaps because his mib104
address isn't in the posters whitelist?

Hi Jim,

The CIF files should be modelled as instances of File (a subclass of
ExperimentObject). Currently, there is no "best practice" for how to link
back to the original file (in eCrystals, we use the dc:identifier property.)

You guessed correctly. The HTML document for the summary/moiety page should
link to the instance of ExperimentRun using a <link> tag:
<link rel="alternate" href="..." title="oreChem" type="application/rdf+xml"
/>

Regards,
Mark

P.S: Assuming that your semantifiers are written using Lensfield: Would it
be possible to generate the ExperimentRun as a side-effect of executing the
Lensfield build structure?

He was listed under a different address. I've added this one.
