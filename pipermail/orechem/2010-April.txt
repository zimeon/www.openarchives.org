Subject: [Orechem] ORE for Crystal moieties
Message-ID: <y2w67fd68331004110210x2463eb1cg1b47aae4ec4e3523@mail.gmail.com>

I had an idea - ORE could be a nice way of managing the relationship of
articles, data sets (CrystalEye summary pages) and moieties. The
relationships are:
* an article can contain several summary pages
* a summary page can contain several identical/different moieties
and...
* a moiety's connection table may be found in several different summaryPages

RDF is a good way of doing this - Nick already exposes zillions of RDF feeds
which are different views on the knowledgebase. I think that ORE would be a
useful representation.

I haven't discussed this with others - especially Jim. But it seems useful.

Maybe I should draw a picture for Tuesday? [We are making useful progress on
extraction]

Peter,

I think this is a really good idea and is exactly the application for which OAI ore is designed. A picture for Tuesday would be quite helpful.

Subject: [Orechem] Paragraph for oreChem project description
Message-ID: <4BCDA7FA.9090201@soton.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I've created a page on the wiki to use as a high-level description of 
the project's goals and deliverables:
http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/ProblemStatement

The page will be used as the basis for future conference papers and 
presentations. I would appreciate any comments and suggestions.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [Orechem] How should we model CrystalEye CIFS in OREChem Ontology?
Message-ID: <u2m2ab1b111004270842m2f87962ckdda1218c155849af@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Mark,

We're revising our crystallographic semantifiers. How should we model the
CIF files CrystalEye has?

I'm guessing that there is an implicit Xray crystallographic experiment that
is an instance of ExperimentRun, that emits the CIF that is an
ExperimentObject?

Is this right?

Cheers,
jim

P.S. I am leaving the University (and the HE sector) at the end of May. If
we need to meet or talk to hand over information or contacts and I haven't
been in touch with you to arrange it, please get in touch with me! Thanks,
jim
