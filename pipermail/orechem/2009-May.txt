Now oreChem should perhaps link up with Chemspider?!

looks impressive!

I think we're going one better though by offering NMR data with structures
(eventually), so people can do computer assisted structure determination.
Myself/Peter/PSU folks have a paper going to docEng09 on the extraction work.

I think we would be going several steps further when oreChem can deliver the stuff from the lab that doesn't get published in a useable form. However, with the RSC now backing/taking over this, ChemSpider has taken a massive step forward in terms of the public facing aspect and credibility that the RSC provides.

Subject: CAS Launches Free Web-Based Resource ?Common Chemistry? for General Public


From the News Release:<http://www.cas.org/newsevents/releases/commonchemistry051209.html>

Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), a division of the American Chemical Society and the most comprehensive and authoritative source of chemical information, has launched a new, free, web-based resource called Common Chemistry<http://www.commonchemistry.org/>.

This resource is helpful to non-chemists and others who might know either a chemical name or a CAS Registry Number of a common everyday chemical and want to pair both pieces of information.

Common Chemistry<http://www.commonchemistry.org/> contains approximately 7800 chemicals of widespread and general interest, as well as all 118 elements from the periodic table. With the exception of some of the elements, all other substances in this collection were deemed of widespread interest by having been cited 1000 or more times in the CAS databases. Examples of substances in Common Chemistry include widely recognizable ones such as caffeine, benzoyl peroxide (acne treatment), and sodium chloride (table salt).

?Anyone can easily search by CAS Registry Number or chemical name and confirm the substance details, such as the CAS Registry Number, chemical names or synonyms, molecular formula, chemical structure, and a reciprocal Wikipedia link when available,? said Christine McCue, CAS Vice President, Marketing. ?Visitors also have the ability to bookmark the page using social media tools, such as Delicious and Digg.?

While not intended to be a comprehensive CAS Registry Number (CAS RN) lookup service, Common Chemistry<http://www.commonchemistry.org/> does provide access to information on chemicals of general interest. The CAS Registry Number is recognized throughout the world as the most commonly used, unique identifier of chemical substances. The full CAS REGISTRY database contains more than 46 million organic and inorganic substances. Research discovery and patent tools such as SciFinder and STN allow users to search the entire database.

Hello everyone,

I had originally suggested that we would have our monthly phone  
conference tomorrow May 27. However, I think we should move it next  
Thursday, June 4, because of how late I got around to sending of this  
notice. Sorry about that. So please put on your calendars our call at  
noon EST next Thursday, June 4 during which we will discuss our plans  
for the upcoming meeting the following week. Alex or Lee, can you  
please send out call instructions for this call.

Folks;

I want to gauge the interest of taking the extracted
NMR/molecular document data and doing something useful with it, eg., computer
assisted structure determination, drug discovery etc. Some of us are publishing
the extraction algorithms at docEng09, including the first steps toward the
semantic representation, by fitting the NMR data and constructing peak lists.
Mark Borkum from Soton is expertly taking over the development of the parser,
so there is great potential for scaling this up very soon.

Could those
of us who are interested have a chat during Karl (Mueller)'s PSU workshop? I
have an offer for a permanent job and want to see this take off before I leave
PSU.

cheers,

bill brouwer
