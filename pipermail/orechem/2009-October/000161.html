<PRE>As I'm sure you know we have a project conference call scheduled for  
11 AM Eastern time on Friday, October 9. The major purpose of this  
call is to make certain that we hit the ground running at our face-to- 
face meeting in Pittsburgh on October 14. Therefore, I would like each  
group on the phone call to present a review of their progress to date,  
what they would like to present/demonstrate at the face-to-face  
meeting, and what issues they need to be discussed at the face-to-face  
meeting in order to move forward in the next couple of months. Since I  
view the decision on a common ontology for the entities that we wish  
to represent - documents, experiments, molecules/compounds - as  
critical to our progress, I am hoping to take a major part of the face- 
to-face meeting in reviewing what we have proposed and seeing whether  
it fulfills our needs. Another thing we need to nail down as soon as  
possible and some decision on identification structure/syntax for the  
entities that we wish to represent. We can do something ad hoc here,  
but it needs to be consistent and deterministic so we can translate it  
in the future for something more standardized. I am happy to entertain  
other ideas for what we wish to do when we meet face-to-face.

At this point my understanding of who will be attending is Lee and  
Alex from Microsoft, Nico from Cambridge, Mark from Southampton, Lee  
and Karl from Penn State, Marlon from Indiana, and myself from  
Cornell. If I have missed you or mistakenly reported you as attending  
please let me know as soon as possible so we can get catering and  
dinner reservations nailed down.

</PRE>
