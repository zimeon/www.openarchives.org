<PRE>Hi all:

The response to request for responses via the doodle link at <A HREF="http://www.doodle.com/a9w2r3u3xw8zah5d">http://www.doodle.com/a9w2r3u3xw8zah5d</A> 
  has been quite underwhelming (zero)!  Can people please follow  
through on this so we can have a productive meeting in December.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At our recent meeting in Pittsburgh is a few action items to be  
</I>&gt;<i> completed by last Friday. I missed that deadline, my apologies, but  
</I>&gt;<i> here they are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, I have put two new pages up on the wiki accessible from the  
</I>&gt;<i> front page. One is to list presentations relevant to the project and  
</I>&gt;<i> the other to list papers. I have also created corresponding places  
</I>&gt;<i> in our SVN repository for these items. This repository is located at <A HREF="http://services.nsdl.org/svn/oreChem/">http://services.nsdl.org/svn/oreChem/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i>  and now contains three directories; meeting materials,  
</I>&gt;<i> presentations, and papers. This repository should be read write  
</I>&gt;<i> accessible by all of you. After storing your materials here you can  
</I>&gt;<i> then link to them from the appropriate wiki pages. I have uploaded a  
</I>&gt;<i> number of presentations and papers from recent meetings, workshops,  
</I>&gt;<i> and conferences. For example, in the papers wiki page I have linked  
</I>&gt;<i> to papers submitted to the recent Web science and Microsoft eScience  
</I>&gt;<i> conferences, and a link to copies of the eChemistry workshop white  
</I>&gt;<i> paper and upcoming nature chemistry article on that white paper.  
</I>&gt;<i> Please note, that copies of papers stored on these internal project  
</I>&gt;<i> pages are not public and should be distributed only with the members  
</I>&gt;<i> of the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, I had promised to do some design work on our information  
</I>&gt;<i> transfer format. This work is now written up at <A HREF="http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/DocumentOntology#Atomizingdocumentontologyinstances">http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/DocumentOntology#Atomizingdocumentontologyinstances</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> .   Briefly summarizing, I have put together an OAI ore-based atom  
</I>&gt;<i> encoding for the document information that we extract from documents  
</I>&gt;<i> and then pass along to subsequent partners. It is based on the  
</I>&gt;<i> workflow that we discussed at our meeting whereby Penn State  
</I>&gt;<i> analyzes a raw document, extracts bibliographic and other data,  
</I>&gt;<i> encodes that as an OAI ORE aggregation and resource map and then  
</I>&gt;<i> makes it available via atom to Southhampton who extracts additional  
</I>&gt;<i> information and enhances the aggregation resource map, passes out on  
</I>&gt;<i> to Cambridge, etc. Following the suggestion of Jim Downing, I  
</I>&gt;<i> believe this all should be done using the atom feed paging and  
</I>&gt;<i> archiving technique outlined in RFC 5005 (<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5005.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5005.txt</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> ). This workflow is illustrated in slide 17 of the slides accessible  
</I>&gt;<i> at ms escience 2009.pptx.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's critically important that we converge on this (or some other)  
</I>&gt;<i> transfer format and resolve the few open issues that I list as soon  
</I>&gt;<i> as possible. Therefore, I would like each group to assign one person  
</I>&gt;<i> to look at the format, evaluate whether it is sensible and whether  
</I>&gt;<i> it fulfills our needs, and determined whether they can implement it  
</I>&gt;<i> so we can get experiments running as soon as possible (e.g. before  
</I>&gt;<i> our December meeting). I have put up a doodle page at <A HREF="http://www.doodle.com/a9w2r3u3xw8zah5d">http://www.doodle.com/a9w2r3u3xw8zah5d</A> 
</I>&gt;<i>  to schedule a meeting amongst the people who will do this  
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation, I will of course be on that phone call. Again, this  
</I>&gt;<i> phone call is only for the individuals in each group will be doing  
</I>&gt;<i> this evaluation and possibly the development of the code to  
</I>&gt;<i> implement it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to emphasize again that it is very important that we move  
</I>&gt;<i> forward with this and implement it as soon as possible so we can  
</I>&gt;<i> move on from our data collection and extraction process to  
</I>&gt;<i> application development upon the triples that we will store.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Finally, I'd like to remind you of our next all group meeting in  
</I>&gt;<i> London on December 5 and sixth. I will be getting back to you in the  
</I>&gt;<i> near future with logistics and will schedule a phone call a week or  
</I>&gt;<i> two before that meeting amongst all of us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still need to get the notes up from the previous meeting, but  
</I>&gt;<i> considered this stuff first priority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, Carl
</I>
