Subject: [Orechem] Meeting in the UK in connection with IDCC and IEEE
	escience 2009
Message-ID: <028EA636-2495-4ED6-8D46-EAF7D50F5D87@gmail.com>

Hi all:

We have discussed a number of times fairness to our UK colleagues via  
a UK meeting.  The upcoming Data Curation Conference in London on  
December 2-4 and IEEE eScience conference in Oxford on Dec 9-11 are an  
excellent opportunity for this.  I have put up a doodle poll with  
three sets of dates - Dec. 1/2, 5/6, and 11/12.  Please sign up for  
them in pairs.

This will be quite an important meeting to plan for the year ahead.

Thanks, Carl

All,
If you are planning to attend the oreChem meeting on 10/14 (or will be sending a delegate), please send me an email.  [Please: Just to me...not the entire list!]

We need to get a count a.s.a.p., plus I need to know if you are also attending the Microsoft eScience meeting as well - for travel purposes.  If you haven't already made your travel arrangements for the MS eScience meeting, I need to inform the travel agents who will be arriving a day early for the oreChem meeting - so we can approve the extra day, etc.

So far, I am only aware of:

*         Cornell: Carl attending. Theresa?

*         Cambridge: Peter and Jim not attending, but sending Nico as proxy.

*         Southampton: Jeremy and Simon not attending, but sending Mark Borkum as proxy.

*         Penn State: Lee, Karl, and Prasenjit?

*         Indiana: Geoffrey and Marlin?

*         Queensland: Jane?

Thanks, all!

Subject: [Orechem] Preparing for Friday's phone call.
Message-ID: <A5B9AC3D-5757-4234-8D76-881F24FD9913@gmail.com>

As I'm sure you know we have a project conference call scheduled for  
11 AM Eastern time on Friday, October 9. The major purpose of this  
call is to make certain that we hit the ground running at our face-to- 
face meeting in Pittsburgh on October 14. Therefore, I would like each  
group on the phone call to present a review of their progress to date,  
what they would like to present/demonstrate at the face-to-face  
meeting, and what issues they need to be discussed at the face-to-face  
meeting in order to move forward in the next couple of months. Since I  
view the decision on a common ontology for the entities that we wish  
to represent - documents, experiments, molecules/compounds - as  
critical to our progress, I am hoping to take a major part of the face- 
to-face meeting in reviewing what we have proposed and seeing whether  
it fulfills our needs. Another thing we need to nail down as soon as  
possible and some decision on identification structure/syntax for the  
entities that we wish to represent. We can do something ad hoc here,  
but it needs to be consistent and deterministic so we can translate it  
in the future for something more standardized. I am happy to entertain  
other ideas for what we wish to do when we meet face-to-face.

At this point my understanding of who will be attending is Lee and  
Alex from Microsoft, Nico from Cambridge, Mark from Southampton, Lee  
and Karl from Penn State, Marlon from Indiana, and myself from  
Cornell. If I have missed you or mistakenly reported you as attending  
please let me know as soon as possible so we can get catering and  
dinner reservations nailed down.

All,
Per discussions at the oreChem meeting here in Pittsburgh today, Mark Borkum from Southampton asked about how best to tackle ORE functionality of Word 2007 with the impending arrival of Chem4Word.   As I mentioned, we currently have these bits of functionality resident in two different add-ins:

Article Authoring Add-in for Word 2007 (v2)  - binary download at: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=09C55527-0759-4D6D-AE02-51E90131997E&displaylang=en

*         Contains features for ORE linking and building a ReM with a .docx file format

Chem4Word (tech preview) - in final testing / not yet publically available, but I am comfortable if Cambridge shares the binaries ONLY with oreChem participants.

*         Project website at: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chem4word/default.aspx

I would like to suggest that Mark Borkum, Jim Downing and Alex Wade connect to discuss how best to bridge this gap...or which add-in to extend for the purpose of optimizing Chem4Word for use in the oreChem project.

Gentlemen-over to you...

Subject: [Orechem] Some new things to look at - please read completely
Message-ID: <7D7693B0-BD15-418C-8C71-DDB40B7BF26D@gmail.com>

Hi all,

At our recent meeting in Pittsburgh is a few action items to be  
completed by last Friday. I missed that deadline, my apologies, but  
here they are.

First, I have put two new pages up on the wiki accessible from the  
front page. One is to list presentations relevant to the project and  
the other to list papers. I have also created corresponding places in  
our SVN repository for these items. This repository is located at http://services.nsdl.org/svn/oreChem/ 
  and now contains three directories; meeting materials,  
presentations, and papers. This repository should be read write  
accessible by all of you. After storing your materials here you can  
then link to them from the appropriate wiki pages. I have uploaded a  
number of presentations and papers from recent meetings, workshops,  
and conferences. For example, in the papers wiki page I have linked to  
papers submitted to the recent Web science and Microsoft eScience  
conferences, and a link to copies of the eChemistry workshop white  
paper and upcoming nature chemistry article on that white paper.  
Please note, that copies of papers stored on these internal project  
pages are not public and should be distributed only with the members  
of the project.

Second, I had promised to do some design work on our information  
transfer format. This work is now written up at http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/DocumentOntology#Atomizingdocumentontologyinstances 
.   Briefly summarizing, I have put together an OAI ore-based atom  
encoding for the document information that we extract from documents  
and then pass along to subsequent partners. It is based on the  
workflow that we discussed at our meeting whereby Penn State analyzes  
a raw document, extracts bibliographic and other data, encodes that as  
an OAI ORE aggregation and resource map and then makes it available  
via atom to Southhampton who extracts additional information and  
enhances the aggregation resource map, passes out on to Cambridge,  
etc. Following the suggestion of Jim Downing, I believe this all  
should be done using the atom feed paging and archiving technique  
outlined in RFC 5005 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5005.txt). This  
workflow is illustrated in slide 17 of the slides accessible at ms  
escience 2009.pptx.

It's critically important that we converge on this (or some other)  
transfer format and resolve the few open issues that I list as soon as  
possible. Therefore, I would like each group to assign one person to  
look at the format, evaluate whether it is sensible and whether it  
fulfills our needs, and determined whether they can implement it so we  
can get experiments running as soon as possible (e.g. before our  
December meeting). I have put up a doodle page at http://www.doodle.com/a9w2r3u3xw8zah5d 
  to schedule a meeting amongst the people who will do this  
evaluation, I will of course be on that phone call. Again, this phone  
call is only for the individuals in each group will be doing this  
evaluation and possibly the development of the code to implement it.

I'd like to emphasize again that it is very important that we move  
forward with this and implement it as soon as possible so we can move  
on from our data collection and extraction process to application  
development upon the triples that we will store.

  Finally, I'd like to remind you of our next all group meeting in  
London on December 5 and sixth. I will be getting back to you in the  
near future with logistics and will schedule a phone call a week or  
two before that meeting amongst all of us.

I still need to get the notes up from the previous meeting, but  
considered this stuff first priority.

Thanks, Carl

Hi all:

The response to request for responses via the doodle link at http://www.doodle.com/a9w2r3u3xw8zah5d 
  has been quite underwhelming (zero)!  Can people please follow  
through on this so we can have a productive meeting in December.
