All,

I am afraid I cannot make the call today. I am in the office again on Monday and can pick up + action emails, but then will be travelling to PSU. See you all there next week.

Best wishes,
Simon.

The main issue for today's phone call is to jointly formulate a non- 
intrusive but effective project planning & tracking technology.  I'd  
like us all to show up at PSU with monthly goals planned over the next  
6 months and then have one place where we can edit it and share it.     
I can do this privately in MS project but need advice on a more public  
method.  My impression is if we dont do this, we are not going to make  
the progress we need to make.

I will not be on the call (I am giving a talk in Vancouver this 
morning).  I will see you in State College !

Just a note on the oreChem meeting - I have a room set up, and will be 
providing breakfast and lunch, as well as morning and afternoon break 
refreshments.  Dinner will be a nicely catered deal at Lee Gile's house.

PLEASE  LET ADRIAN KNOW ANY DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.

ALSO - contact Adrian if you have not registered for the Workshop and 
need internet access - she will gather information from you and we will 
have login information ready for you.

I will be available for dinner on Tuesday for any who arrive in time - 
let's meet at 6 PM at the Days Inn lobby.  Please RSVP so we know who to 
expect/wait for.

Sorry that I couldn't make it today. I'm at NAACL and my cell phone died
with my charger
in my room. I'm sure Prasenjit was able to handle most of what we have done.

There is some interesting work on ontology population from Tom
Mitchell's group at
CMU. We may be able to use it.

Again, my apologies.

Lee

Folks;

I also apologize for missing the phone meeting...

I've finished a paper for docEng09 on molecule/spectra extraction from
PostScript, with a plug 
for Orechem. We have some nice results, I'm very grateful for Peter's input and
to 

Jeremy/Simon for lending me Mark who has greatly extended the parser and upped
the accuracy. 

I've lost access to the Microsoft portal, please let me know if you'd like a
copy.


Peter et al, can we have a beer next week to decide next steps? As I say, I'd
love to see it take

off before I leave PSU. Mark has set up a server and we are looking at batching
this to provide 

data for use with structure determination/drug discovery etc. 



cheers,

bill brouwer

Hi all,

Apologies for not making the meeting, my mac crashed... yes, that's right:
MY MAC .... CRASHED... there, happy? Anyway - by the time it had fscked
itself back to life the meeting was over.

Which is a shame because I had some progress to report! Nick Day has
refactored the publication crawling routines from CrystalEye into standalone
package (called "pub-crawler"), and added the capability to produce ORE ReMs
of journal articles including alternative format renditions, basic metadata
(including DOI) and supporting information. This functionality will
hopefully go live today and the data will be percolating through CrystalEye
over the weekend.

Pub-crawler also gives us the capability to produce ReMs including
supporting information as an overlay to lots of different journals. So far
we've experimented with Nature Chemistry, since they have excellent metadata
support (they have RDFa in their web pages, w00t!), and put a lot of
information into the quality of the SI. This could be a really good stepping
stone to persuading the publishers to support ORE themselves.

Best regards,
jim

Message-ID: <67fd68330906120731i5e9c75ct1058cecb7fd7a299@mail.gmail.com>

This is to review the subprojects that the computational geeks in OREChem
have put together over the last few days. (a) is long term, (b) is immediate
(a) The general goal is to compute NMR spectra for all new published
compounds and compare them with spectra. This is a new approach "robot
refereeing of chemistry publications" and any differences suggest errors or
new chemistry. This is long term (months) and consists of the following (as
we have put on the wiki):
* PSU-Lee/Prasenjit retrieve chemistry-rich docs from publisher sites (ask
for forgiveness policy) and segment the papers into text+non-text (tables,
diagrams). This passes to:
* Mark - Soton extracts molecules and spectra out of this and converts them
to SVG. The short-term goal is to get this working by the end of next week
in a pragmatic form. (we do not mind if recall is poor as long as we get a
few SVGs as we need to develop the machine-learning and/or heuristics and
find out what unknown horrors we have to deal with.
Bitmaps are rejected at this stage
* PMR- cambridge develops heuristics to interpret (i) molecules (ii) spectra
(C13 and H1). These might later be crowdsourced. The output is CML molecules
and spectra. It is unlikely we have assignments
* PSU - Bill+Karl. Analyse spectra with peak-fitting.
* IU - Marlon. (independently) molecules are passed to IU in CML and put
into the NMREye workflow for computing peaks (below). IU run this

(b) To get IU up to speed we shall start immediately on simple molecules
from Pubchem. This involves just Cambridge and IU.
* The NMREye workflow has been developed and tested and should work on
simple organic compounds. It consists of the following:

  - convert CML to Gaussian input. We have an XSLT script, but could convert
this to Java in an hour.

take from 0.1 seconds to 1 day (probably) as they scale with N^4.

cool peter...

I would also add that there's some mileage in substructure & similarity search
on spectra. Han gave a great talk this morning, there is strong application of
his graph mining work to building up complicated spectra on the basis of
simpler (sub)spectra...

Dear colleagues,

Thanks for participating in what I thought was a rather successful  
meeting in setting goals over the next few months. I forgot to call  
attention at the meeting to the "my experiment" work at Southampton  
and Manchester. Some of you, especially Jeremy and Simon, I'm sure  
know about this work. As you can see from the website, and especially  
the ontology page, they make use of ORE in their modeling. Nico, it  
might be interesting for you to look at this and critique it if you  
haven't already.

I will be putting notes from our meeting up on the wiki sometime early  
next week. Regards, Carl
http://rdf.myexperiment.org/

Great - that's exciting Bill and I am sure that it will be invaluable for
assignment. However I am focusssing on what we can integrate today. The
integration problems are not trivial and the more that the components - or
the sites - are modularised the faster progress we shall

It's important to be pragmatic at this stage - there are things we can do
now and things that are research. We should do both but we must make sure
that the infrastructure continues in a straight line. I detailed what we
could do at present (some as rough proof of concept) that could fit into a
linear workflow. We must make sure that the research efforts in the pipeline
I indicated are small as the integration of itself will still be
challenging.

So I am propopsing that we should ask:
* what can we do by Friday 19?
* what can we do by the start of August?
* what can we do in the rest of the project.

Each part depends on the previous one:
* Mark needs a few papers from Lee/Prasenjit which have good PDF chemistry
* PMR needs a few molecules and spectra in SVG
* Marlon needs a few CML molecules and the NMREye workflow.

I agree that Mark's work on general PDF parsing is exciting but we need a
stream of molecules for the later stages.

I am also going to suggest that we try to arrange weekly telcons to review
progress. The problem of a pipeline/workflow is that all bits have to be
delivering.

P.

I agree. I am mailing the various agreements that we made between those
involved in semanticization workflows and high-throughput computing. I think
these can go in complete parallel to the ontology of experiments.

no worries Peter, understood. If anybody needs anything from me beyond what's
in our paper & at the wiki already ->
http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/ChemistryDataExtraction, do let me
know...

I'm going to start taking a look at the AI/search possibilities of our fitted
spectra database then -> http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci950092p

cheers,

Dr Brouwer,

Things have come a long way since the 1996 article you reference. For a modern review regarding automated structure elucidation I refer you to:

 M. E. Elyashberg, A. J. Williams, and G. E. Martin. Computer-Assisted Structure Verification and Elucidation Tools In NMR-Based Structure Elucidation. Review article. Progress in NMR Spectroscopy (2007) 10.1016/j.pnmrs.2007.04.003

As one of the authors of this work feel free to contact me at the email address below and I can provide some guidance regarding where automated structure elucidation is today. There are commercial products on the market today and Christoph Steinbeck from EBI has his own work going on in this area. Peter knows him well I believe. Chris also has Open SOurce NMR prediction tools online at NMRSHiftDB that you might be interested in using.

As the product manager for a CASE system (Computer Assisted Structure Elucidation) for many years I can say that the challenge is not easy but that there has been a lot of progress made over the years. SOme other papers that might interest you (excuse the numbers...snipped out of my CV).

On ChemSpider we will be integrating Chris Steinbeck's NMR shift prediction technology in the near future we hope. Best wishes.

no worries Peter, understood. If anybody needs anything from me beyond what's in our paper & at the wiki already -> http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/ChemistryDataExtraction, do let me know...

I'm going to start taking a look at the AI/search possibilities of our fitted spectra database then -> http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci950092p

Great - that's exciting Bill and I am sure that it will be invaluable for assignment. However I am focusssing on what we can integrate today. The integration problems are not trivial and the more that the components - or the sites - are modularised the faster progress we shall

It's important to be pragmatic at this stage - there are things we can do now and things that are research. We should do both but we must make sure that the infrastructure continues in a straight line. I detailed what we could do at present (some as rough proof of concept) that could fit into a linear workflow. We must make sure that the research efforts in the pipeline I indicated are small as the integration of itself will still be challenging.

So I am propopsing that we should ask:
* what can we do by Friday 19?
* what can we do by the start of August?
* what can we do in the rest of the project.

Each part depends on the previous one:
* Mark needs a few papers from Lee/Prasenjit which have good PDF chemistry
* PMR needs a few molecules and spectra in SVG
* Marlon needs a few CML molecules and the NMREye workflow.

I agree that Mark's work on general PDF parsing is exciting but we need a stream of molecules for the later stages.

I am also going to suggest that we try to arrange weekly telcons to review progress. The problem of a pipeline/workflow is that all bits have to be delivering.

cool peter...

I would also add that there's some mileage in substructure & similarity search on spectra. Han gave a great talk this morning, there is strong application of his graph mining work to building up complicated spectra on the basis of simpler (sub)spectra...

Peter,

I know that NMREye workflow is already established but have you considered integrating to Chris Steinbeck's NMR prediction web services? See: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/nmrshiftdb/axis/NMRShiftDB.wsdl

I met with Chris and Stefan Kuhn while I was in Cambridge a couple of weeks ago and we will be doing the work to integrate ChemSPider to the web services ourselves in the near future.

If you would like to test NMREye on some real world spectra there are some excellent Open Data now available on ChemSPider and they can be reviewed here: http://www.chemspider.com/spectra.aspx. The molecules and associated JCAMP spectra can be downloaded. I know that this is not the project that you are trying to do but it may form a good test set anyway for NMREye. The data have been curated via the spectral game... www.spectralgame.com<http://www.spectralgame.com>

Best wishes.

Dear Dr Williams;

Thank you for your expert input; I must confess
to only looking at a few CASE examples from google scholar. We
do
 however reference your recent work in Journal of Cheminformatics,  in our
paper on information extraction from
documents.

There was an excellent presentation given by Jiawei Han at PSU last Friday, I
foresee great application of his algorithms 
to CASE. Your expert advice would also be
greatly valued, I will indeed be in touch and cc Peter et al, there
 are a
number of folks here at PSU who will no doubt be interested as well.


many thanks again;

Thanks Antony,
Just to clarify there is a part of the project devoted to high-throughput
high performance computing and it is important that this stress the
computational resources provided by the Inidiana Grid system and also use
the ontologies that already exist for gaussian calculations. So NMR
parameters are just a few of the properties that we shall be calculating -
we shall also get many others such as electronic properties.

Subject: [Orechem] File upload to svn on trac
Message-ID: <5F68A42F-6FA2-416A-80C0-16877C782B79@me.com>

As requested at the meeting, we have fixed the subversion repository  
on the trac site to allow you to upload files.  Everyone with an id on  
the trac site should now have read/write permissions to the repository  
at http://services.nsdl.org/svn/oreChem/.  So that we can keep the  
repository under control please create a directory under root for your  
individual group (e.g., PSU, Soton, Cambridge, Indiana, etc.). It is  
up to you on how to organize within that directory.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will be finishing up meeting  
notes ASAP.

Carl

Thanks for detailing this Peter.  It would be great to get this up on  
the wiki.  Let me know if I can do anything to facilitate.

Message-ID: <7F25968C-5FE1-4A06-B75B-226FE0FDC50C@gmail.com>

Hi all:

I've updated the trac site with minutes of our recent meeting and put  
in work tickets for the ontology work we have all committed to.  You  
can see these by clicking on the milestones and tickets link on the  
start page at http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/WikiStart.

Also, we all committed to a phone meeting to review our ontology work  
and keep in moving forward on July 13.  I've doodled it at http://doodle.com/2zwwhksqr6vxpfef 
.  There is only one time to choose from, but please complete so I  
know who will be joining.

Carl

You will note that the wiki start page now has links to pages where we  
can all record our individual ontology work.

InChI is a menace because it's written in C and messy. JNIchi is a wrapper.

Does it run as well as compile?

You need jumbo converter. Then you should run PubChem2CML.

We need some modest docco here because I tend to run it from Eclipse. Nick
has a clojure pipeline. I will talk with him tomorrow. If we can't work that
I will create the docco.
