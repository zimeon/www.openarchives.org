Subject: [Orechem] All-project conference call
Message-ID: <23593CF3-640B-4C8C-BCD5-9B761862F8A4@gmail.com>

Hello colleagues,

I hope all of you in the northern hemisphere are enjoying the end of  
your summer in whatever manner you find most rewarding (workaholism,  
vacation, etc.). I personally had a wonderful two weeks in southern  
France and now I'm back to workaholism.

We need to have an all group conference call in the next couple of  
weeks to chart progress, plan a face-to-face meeting, and finish up  
the data model issues that were ongoing about a month ago. I haven't  
seen any reaction to my proposals and I'm hoping to light a fire under  
that discussion.

Please complete the doodle at http://doodle.com/ytc59x3nq6wgaep6  so I  
can schedule the call.

Best regards, Carl

Recognizing that this is a MS-funded project ;-)  This is very  
interesting (note Chem applications in article).  BTW, did anyone go  
to the Science Online Conf?  Jeremy and Simon - you must know Neylon  
who is mentioned in the article.

Sure we know Cameron!! He is actually in the process of moving to STFC, but has been an enthusiastic user of our Blogging system and a strong advocate of Open Science. He is very enthusiastic about Wave...

If it actually takes off for science then oreChem work would actually support it...

Simon.

Hi Carl,

Peter and I went and we have both written up some notes during the day
on our blogs (see here http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/adams/  (check
out all the August entries) and here
http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2223). There is a
Friendfeed group with discussion during the day
(http://friendfeed.com/solondon), a list of blog posts
(http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/23/thoughts-on-the-science-online-london-conference)
and extensive tweeting (search for #solo09 hashtag on twitter).

Best,

N.

I still have not gotten complete responses to my request for  
scheduling a conference call at http://doodle.com/ytc59x3nq6wgaep6.    
however, based on the responses I've gotten thus far, I have  
tentatively scheduled a call for noon Eastern time on Wednesday,  
September 9. The only person who indicated he couldn't make it at this  
time so far is Alex. However, I do need to hear from other people to  
make sure that we can do it at this time. I will confirm this time and  
date at the end of the week.

Carl
