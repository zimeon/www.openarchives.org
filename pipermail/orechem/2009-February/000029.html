<PRE>hi all:

I am sending this out to the general list even though only a few of  
you have indicated your availability for this call. We will once again  
be using yuuguu for the call, please note that the call-in number and  
code will be displayed in your yuuguu client when you connect to me.  
yuuguu should know what country you are in so that it gives you the  
proper call in number, but if it doesn't get this right, you can set  
your country and your individual profile. My identity, as before, is  
clagoze. Please e-mail me if you have any questions about this  
procedure.

I have spent the morning reading papers from the Southhampton group  
about their RDF modeling and from the Cambridge group about CML.  
Clearly, and as we have discussed before, we want to make use of this  
work and somehow integrated with my work on OAI-ORE. We had some  
proposals in our previous call on how to integrate it with CML, but we  
have yet to discuss how to make use of the RDF model from Cambridge.  
Simon, if you can think a little bit about this for the call and speak  
about it that would be great.

By the way, looking at the wiki I see that a number of queries have  
been listed in the compound centric modeling section, but none have  
been listed in the document centric modeling section. I believe the  
Penn State folks were going to put something here, if you can do that  
before the phone call that would be great.

Talk to you in approximately 45 minutes.

Carl

</PRE>
