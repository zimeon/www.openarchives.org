<PRE>Carl,
I was thinking perhaps to add two quick items to your agenda for the 3/28-29 meeting: 

 - A presentation and work-in-progress demo of the &quot;Chem4Word&quot; project [Peter Murray-Rust + Alex Wade]
 - A quick demo of the ORE functionality we are integrating into Word 2007 [Pablo Fernicola] 

I think quick walk-throughs of this work would be useful for all to see.

We should plan to meet in Building 99 on the Microsoft campus.
-jld

P.S. - I'll get working on those dinner reservations!

Hi all:

Time moves along and the time of our all-project face-2-face meeting  
is approaching.  Just to remind you that meeting is scheduled for  
March 28-29 on the Microsoft campus in Redmond (exact location to be  
announced).  We will start early afternoon on March 28, go to a joint  
dinner that evening (Lee and/or Alex, please delight us with a  
wonderful cuisine recommendation), and then meet all day on Sunday  
until the reception for the MS research meeting.  Please make  
reservations in consideration of this.

My main agenda item for this meeting is the joint data model we will  
work with.  A number of us have been working &quot;behind the  
scenes&quot; (stuff is up on the wiki) on this.  Since so much is dependent  
on this we really need to come to some agreement on this.  Therefore,  
I am willing to occupy almost all the meeting on this since face-to- 
face interaction on these types of design issues is so effective.   
However, I am open to more suggestions.

Also, as you know we have scheduled month-to-month all-project phone  
conferences.  I have put up a Doodle poll for times.  Please sign up  
as soon as possible.

Regards,

Carl
