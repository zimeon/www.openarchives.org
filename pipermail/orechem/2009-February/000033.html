Amazon Exposes 1 Terabyte of Public Data to Developers
Written by Marshall Kirkpatrick / February 25, 2009 5:26 AM / 15

Amazon.com changed the retail world. In the process the company built  
up so much surplus computing power that it started a dirt cheap  
&quot;computing in the cloud&quot; business that changed the computing world.  
This week the company's newest project Public Data Sets on Amazon Web  
Services began offering more than 1 Terabyte (1000 GB) of fascinating  
public data for developers to access on the fly through Amazon's cloud  
computing service.

We're talking about an annotated collection of all publicly available  
DNA sequences, including the Human Genome, huge amounts of chemistry  
data, machine readable encyclopedic entries about millions of  
different topics and an entire dump of Wikipedia. US Census data, data  
from the US Department of Transportation and more. It's all accessible  
by web applications in no time at all. What do you think this is going  
to change?

The company made a blog post last night announcing the availability of  
four new public data sets.

This includes data from:
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

DBPedia Knowledge Base - which &quot;currently describes more than 2.6  
million things including 213,000 people, 328,000 places, 57,000 music  
albums, 36,000 films, and 20,000 companies.&quot; All in handy semantic  
markup.

The Freebase Data Dump - the giant collaboratively build semantic  
database on a wide variety of topics, data that high profile startup  
Metaweb has spent millions of dollars assembling.

The entire English section of Wikipedia, dumped into a machine  
readable format.

A number of large genetic and scientific databases.
We counted all the databases up and it passed 1 TB of available data.  
The company says that accessing this data is &quot;trivial&quot; for developers.

What are developers going to do with this data? We can't wait to find  
out. The prospect of mashing up, cross referencing and user  
interfacing with this amount of data is nearly unfathomable. Really.  
This data will be leveraged by all kinds of different web  
applications, for a long time.

You've read, or can imagine, the impact that the first Public  
Libraries had on human culture. Now imagine the opening up of not just  
this, but other libraries of data, so huge that economies of scale  
blast the project off beyond any analogy that could be drawn with our  
everyday experience or historical memories. It won't just be Amazon  
that offers up this kind of data - it will be relatively commonplace  
soon, we imagine.

It will be like a network of libraries - for robots. Robots that go to  
the library frequently, read very fast and make serious use of what  
they've learned.

Congratulations, Amazon, on passing 1 TB of public data made  
available. May all our robots of the future please live in peace.

Are you sure its 1TB? Just Wikipedia by itself would make up a  
significant chunk of that space, and since it includes dbpedia (thus  
duplicating most content)... Terabytes are cheap these days. I have  
two TB of data just on my home desktop PC.

You apparently have to have an EC2 account and active instance to be  
able to get access to the data, so for the mean time there is a cost  
attached to getting hold of the data.

to be honest marshall - you might change that title - when i saw it i  
thought &quot;oh my amazon just got hacked and my info is public!&quot;

not sure if others got the same idea

Posted by: Allen | February 25, 2009 8:22 AM



Amazon is a 'Cloud' Pioneer and I appreciate them for offering these  
datasets to the public. They have a potential to have a huge impact.

I recommend that there be a public information release on how often  
Amazon plans to update these files.
Posted by: Tecue | February 25, 2009 8:59 AM



To be honest, I thought the title was speaking of a vulnerability as  
well. Had to read the article twice to make the connection.

And I'm a user of AWS as well.

Isn't terrabyte is supposed to be spelled terabyte?

Posted by: Bob Ohsiek | February 25, 2009 9:33 AM



Bob - thank you, you are the only real friend I have!

Allen - I would have thought the words &quot;customer data&quot; would have  
given you that impression. But I'll edit the headline.

Posted by: Marshall Kirkpatrick  | February 25, 2009 9:44 AM



Same comment about the title. &quot;Releases&quot; or &quot;Publishes&quot; instead of  
&quot;Exposes&quot; would be less confusing maybe

It's great that Amazon is making all of this data available via EC2  
but the data has always been available for developers that were so  
inclined to use it.

These are public data sets already distributed by the respective  
organizations - from what I can tell this is just clustered to add  
value to Amazon's Web Service offerings.

Anyone have any sense on whether Amazon did work to mark these up  
better, cross reference them, or added any particular value besides  
exposing them from within EC2?

Please go to <A HREF="http://blog.infochimps.org/2009/02/06/start-hacking-machetec2-released">http://blog.infochimps.org/2009/02/06/start-hacking-machetec2-released</A>

It will show you which AMI you need in order to access these new  
datasets. Unfortunately, Amazon is a little light on the details in  
terms of accessing the datasets they just published.

Title is scary, but after reading it, feel much better now.

Yes, boo to the misleading page title.

This system should provide a lot of good fodder to make some  
interesting mashups. Heck you could probably build an entire self- 
contained system just using Amazon products exclusively at this point:
-this service for the raw input
-EC2 and S3 for crunching and storing data
-Mechanical Turk for recognizing patterns in the output analysis

On another note, coincidentally today we released the JumpBox for  
SnapLogic which is essentially an Open Source &quot;Yahoo Pipes&quot; system. I  
recorded a demo video that helps people get started with it. You don't  
have to be a developer anymore to make mashups:

I understood what he meant from the headline immediately... &quot;expose&quot;  
has a bad rap, apparently. Published, released, etc would be  
inaccurate- Amazon is only providing easy access to the info which is  
freely available elsewhere. &quot;Expose&quot; is exactly the right word for that.

  Posted by: Evan  | February 25, 2009 2:17 PM



Totally read the same thing. I thought for sure, and had to do a  
triple take, that Amazon had been hacked.

But, no, this is VERY VERY interesting.

And not at all frightening like the usual digital security issues that  
we are bombarded with each and every day.

You ever read <A HREF="http://www.justaskgemalto.com?">http://www.justaskgemalto.com?</A> Anyway, it's not fun.

But yes, the cloud is very interesting.
