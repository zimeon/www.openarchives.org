Dear oreChem colleagues,

My apologies for dropping off the map for a few weeks but a number of other deadlines, etc diverted my attention.  I hope you are all well.

I am about to disappear again for holiday until August 22.  But before I retreat from the digital world I want to set up two things.

1.  I'd like to schedule an all project telecon on the week I return.  Please fill out the doodle poll at Participation link: to indicate your preference.  

2. Jeremy Frey reminded me of the upcoming MS escience workshop at Berkeley on October 11-13.  This is an excellent opportunity for a f2f meeting.  Please fill out the doodle poll at http://doodle.com/af8isc5erbfcku9c to indicate your availability for this meeting.

Carl

Carl,

I think it would be very sensible to meet at Microsoft eScience. I have indicated that I am free all days, but I really need to be back in the UK on morning of 14th to teach, therefore I would have less preference for a meeting on 13th as I may wish to leave early.

Regards,
Simon.
