 I have posted notes from the December meeting in Southampton on the wiki. Please feel free to comment on them.

As Lee Giles noted, Microsoft has not yet sent out a notice for the April external research meeting. Lee Dirks, can you please confirm that this is going to happen so people feel comfortable making plans for an oreChem that meeting around the same dates.

(I'm looking into when/where the invites are.)

This has caused a massive amount of talk in the crystallographic community (filling my inbox somewhat!). Here's another case that has come to light

http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56226/

and there have been other cases in different journals from the same Acta E authors and even claims of direct 100% plagiarism of journal articles - text, figures etc (not just the crystal structure data!).

Ecrystals and OREChem would help address this problem, as it arises in part from:

"What we know is that when Dr. Murthy was asked to provide the data behind the structures, there was not sufficient material presented to allow the expert panel to determine the source of the error,"

Provenance and clear availability of underlying data is crucial and we can help here! We should try to use these incidents to our benefit...

There are many ways to address this. We could create a data and text
plagiarism detector.
CiteSeerX hopes to have a text similarity detection system up soon.
There are other
plagiarism detectors such as Turnitin that can be used for text. Penn
State has licensed
it for our courses.

To do this, however, requires access to text and data which we don't
easily have in
chemistry.

We have several components which could be part of a "suspicious paper"
detector in small-molecule chemistry (and possibly crystallography). This
term is meant to cover at least:
* syntactic and stylistic problems. This is not per se an indication that
something has been deliberately fudged but it's an indication of poor
quality. This includes incorrect chemical names and locally incorrect
english syntax.
* internal inconsistency. Examples are spectral peaks against element count,
names not consistent with formula, etc.
* inconsistency between values in this paper and the rest of the literature.
This can be done for crystallographic structures (e.g. in CrystalEye) or for
chemical shifts.
* computation. This relates particularly to what Marlon is doing in OREChem.

There is a lot of tedious work to do but it's certainly possible to do some
of these on a high-throughput basis.

I am now fairly bullish about interpreting cvhemical reactions and we canm
extract a lot of this from supplemental data.

As Open Sources of Chemical Information Become More Common, What Role Can a
Publisher Play?

by David Bousfield, Vice President & Lead Analyst - United Kingdom


* ChEMBLdb, an open access online database of information about the
properties and activities of over half a million drugs and drug-like small
molecules and their targets, was launched by the European Bioinformatics
Institute (EBI) earlier this month. There are now dozens of
publicly-accessible databases containing chemical information, so what is
the future role of the publisher in this area?

Important Details:  Data such as these lie at the heart of translating
information from the human genome into successful new drugs in the clinic,
so it is perhaps unsurprising that there are so many different sources.  As
well as ChEBI/ChEMBL [1] (a dictionary of small chemical entities and
catalogue of  interactions between pharmacologically active molecules and
their receptors), significant players include:

* ChemIDPlus [2] (a database of over 380,000 chemicals, synonyms,
structures, regulatory list information, and links to other databases
supported by the National Library of Medicine's Specialized Information
Services);

* Drugbank [3] (a resource that combines detailed chemical, pharmacological
and pharmaceutical data with comprehensive drug target, i.e. sequence,
structure, and pathway information);

* LipidMAPs [4] (a portal for lipid biologists hosted by Nature Publishing
Group);

* PubChem [5] (NIH's database contains details of 37 million chemical
compounds, 71 million substances and bioactivity results from 1644
high-throughput screening programs);

* ZINC [6] (commercially-available compounds used by pharmabiotech
companies for virtual screening).

Implications: These database resources fall into two categories.  Those
that aim for comprehensiveness, but often at the expense of 'findability'
and data quality, and those that are designed to deliver a specific
functionality at a particular point in a given chemistry workflow. 
Publishers should look to the latter for commercial inspiration.  Here we
take a look at chemical procurement as an example.

The Royal Society of Chemistry's (RSC) ChemSpider [7] (see Insights 23 June
2009, InChI InChI Spider - Royal Society of Chemistry Acquires ChemSpider)
is being developed as a publicly accessible chemistry search engine that
aggregates and indexes as many possible open access and proprietary
chemical structures and  associated information sources into a single
searchable repository.  RSC recently announced a joint project with Symyx'
DiscoveryGate enabling customers to browse chemical structure information
on ChemSpider while simultaneously searching synthetic reactions,
bioavailability information and up-to-date compound availability
information from over 860 suppliers stored on DiscoveryGate.  RSC benefits
from custom fees and Symyx' products gain increased functionality.

EMolecule, a small company based on the West Coast has taken this
data/workflow integration one step further.  The company tried to take a
Google-like approach to open access chemistry databases in 2006 but ran
into trouble with its name - Chmoogle [8].  Realising that Amazon perhaps
represented a better role model than Google, they paired up with ChemSW
[9],  provider of chemical and biochemical inventory management systems to
create an integrated procurement solution which allows chemists to search
the eMolecules database for details of more than 5.5 million unique
commercially-available chemical structures from the most important chemical
suppliers.  Users can now perform one-stop shopping and stocking for
batches of hundreds of compounds at a time (an essential stage in the drug
discovery workflow), and because details of vendor reliability, pricing
information, product availability and shipping times are all actively
curated, purchasers can be confident that their orders will be fulfilled on
time.  SciQuest [10] and also Sigma-Aldrich [11] (with its acquisition of
ChemNavigator [12]) have taken similar approaches by combining open access
data with focused curation to provide a valuable service.

As certain types of content become commoditized, sometimes by sheer volume
alone, publishers must learn how to create products that integrate content
from many different sources and which can be curated with a specific
end-user workflow in mind.  They should also be on the lookout for
acquisition opportunities.  In 2007, Thomson Reuters bought Biomolecular
Interaction Network Database (BIND) which had been developed largely at the
expense of the Canadian taxpayer.  Late last year, Nature reported [13]
that the world's most valued plant database, the Arabidopsis Information
Resource (TAIR), faces extinction because its funding is being phased out
by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), and no alternative source is
on the horizon. The NSF suggested that TAIR develop its own self-supporting
funding model, based on user subscriptions and other sources of income. EBI
bought ChEMBLdb from its biotech developers Galapagos NV with a GBP 4.7
million Strategic Award from the Wellcome Trust.  The price reflects the
cost of assembling and maintaining a database of this size.  Without a
business model, such resources can become millstones around the neck of
government budgets in the not-too-distant future.

Colleagues,

I want to confirm our whole project teleconference for noon Eastern time, February 4. Lee Dirks, can you please set up a teleconference line for us. There are four major items on the agenda:

- progress reports from each group

- a discussion of document extraction issues by Penn State software that arose at the Southhampton meeting in December.

- Carl's upcoming presentation at ACS in March and how we can all contribute to that.

- 6 month plan and goals
