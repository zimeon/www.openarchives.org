*CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS*

Ninth UK e-Science All Hands Meeting

13-16 September 2010



The Ninth UK e-Science All Hands Meeting (AHM 2010) is scheduled to be held
13-16 September 2010 at the City Hall in Cardiff. Workshops have been a
successful feature of previous AHM programmes, and proposals for workshops
are now invited. Other modes of participation in AHM 2010 will include oral
presentations of selected submitted papers, posters, birds-of-a-feather
sessions and tutorials. A call for these will be issued in March 2010.



Workshop sessions focus on a particular topic and are organised by
individuals to bring together a number of presenters in a panel or
mini-symposium format. These sessions will be scheduled in parallel with
other conference sessions, but with the expectation that individuals will
not move between sessions.



A proposal to organise a workshop should be submitted by email to the Chair
of the AHM 2010 Programme Committee (see below), and include the following:

&#183;         The title of the workshop.

&#183;         The name, affiliation and contact details of the organiser.

&#183;         The format of the workshop, e.g., panel or mini-symposium.

&#183;         The approximate duration of the workshop. It is expected that
sessions at AHM 2005 will last at least 90 minutes but no more than 120
minutes. Workshops may span multiple sessions.

&#183;         An abstract of no more than one page giving the aims of the
workshop, the motivation for holding it and the target audience.

&#183;         A workshop chair and a tentative list of speakers/participants
should be identified.



Organisers of approved workshops will be responsible for:

&#183;         Liaising with the AHM 2010 Organising Committee to ensure their
session is appropriately resourced.

&#183;         Advertising their workshop and soliciting contributions, if
necessary.

&#183;         Refereeing contributions and recommending which should be accepted
by the AHM 2010 Programme Committee. The PC will delegate to workshop
organisers responsibility for refereeing submissions in accordance with the
conference guidelines. To ensure a uniform high quality of submitted papers
the PC will retain overall control of the workshop programme, and will have
a role in the reviewing of workshop submissions.



The deadline for submission of workshop proposals is *28 February 2010*.
Applicants will be notified of acceptance or rejection by 13 March 2010.
Thereafter workshops featuring contributed papers will follow the schedule
for regular conference papers.
