<PRE>As previously announced we had a phone call scheduled for noon on July  
13 Eastern US time. Alex, can you please give us a conference call  
number?

Here is the agenda for the call:

1. Discussion of ontologies. Please review the information that has  
been put up on the wiki. The writer of each wiki page should be  
prepared to do a short presentation of what they have put up.

2. Discussion of Indiana work in cooperation with Cambridge and Penn  
State. Marlon, can you please be prepared to present this.

3. Discussion what we should propose for a presentation at the October  
Microsoft eScience conference in Pittsburgh. I am happy to write up a  
proposal but I think the topic should be something that we jointly  
develop.

4. Alternatives for our next face-to-face meeting. The obvious one is  
in connection with the Pittsburgh conference, but we need to discuss  
this. Previously we had spoken about something in the UK, perhaps for  
December?

Talk to you all day, have a great weekend.

Carl

PS. A number of you never answered the call scheduling doodle. Please  
join the call if you can.

</PRE>
