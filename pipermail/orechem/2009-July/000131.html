Subject: [Orechem] Phone call Monday, July 13 noon Eastern US time



As previously announced we had a phone call scheduled for noon on July

13 Eastern US time. Alex, can you please give us a conference call

number?



Here is the agenda for the call:



1. Discussion of ontologies. Please review the information that has

been put up on the wiki. The writer of each wiki page should be

prepared to do a short presentation of what they have put up.



2. Discussion of Indiana work in cooperation with Cambridge and Penn

State. Marlon, can you please be prepared to present this.



3. Discussion what we should propose for a presentation at the October

Microsoft eScience conference in Pittsburgh. I am happy to write up a

proposal but I think the topic should be something that we jointly

develop.



4. Alternatives for our next face-to-face meeting. The obvious one is

in connection with the Pittsburgh conference, but we need to discuss

this. Previously we had spoken about something in the UK, perhaps for

December?



Talk to you all day, have a great weekend.



Carl



PS. A number of you never answered the call scheduling doodle. Please

join the call if you can.
