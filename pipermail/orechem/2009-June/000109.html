<PRE>Great - that's exciting Bill and I am sure that it will be invaluable for
assignment. However I am focusssing on what we can integrate today. The
integration problems are not trivial and the more that the components - or
the sites - are modularised the faster progress we shall

It's important to be pragmatic at this stage - there are things we can do
now and things that are research. We should do both but we must make sure
that the infrastructure continues in a straight line. I detailed what we
could do at present (some as rough proof of concept) that could fit into a
linear workflow. We must make sure that the research efforts in the pipeline
I indicated are small as the integration of itself will still be
challenging.

So I am propopsing that we should ask:
* what can we do by Friday 19?
* what can we do by the start of August?
* what can we do in the rest of the project.

Each part depends on the previous one:
* Mark needs a few papers from Lee/Prasenjit which have good PDF chemistry
* PMR needs a few molecules and spectra in SVG
* Marlon needs a few CML molecules and the NMREye workflow.

I agree that Mark's work on general PDF parsing is exciting but we need a
stream of molecules for the later stages.

I am also going to suggest that we try to arrange weekly telcons to review
progress. The problem of a pipeline/workflow is that all bits have to be
delivering.

</I>&gt;<i> we have put on the wiki):
</I>&gt;<i> * PSU-Lee/Prasenjit retrieve chemistry-rich docs from publisher sites (ask
</I>&gt;<i> for forgiveness policy) and segment the papers into text+non-text (tables,

</I>&gt;<i> few SVGs as we need to develop the machine-learning and/or heuristics and
</I>&gt;<i> find out what unknown horrors we have to deal with.
</I>&gt;<i> Bitmaps are rejected at this stage
</I>&gt;<i> * PMR- cambridge develops heuristics to interpret (i) molecules (ii)
</I>&gt;<i> spectra (C13 and H1). These might later be crowdsourced. The output is CML
</I>&gt;<i> molecules and spectra. It is unlikely we have assignments
</I>&gt;<i> * PSU - Bill+Karl. Analyse spectra with peak-fitting.
</I>&gt;<i> * IU - Marlon. (independently) molecules are passed to IU in CML and put
</I>&gt;<i> into the NMREye workflow for computing peaks (below). IU run this
</I>&gt;<i> automatically and return results in CML
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (b) To get IU up to speed we shall start immediately on simple molecules
</I>&gt;<i> from Pubchem. This involves just Cambridge and IU.
</I>&gt;<i> * The NMREye workflow has been developed and tested and should work on
</I>&gt;<i> simple organic compounds. It consists of the following:
</I>&gt;<i>   - convert PubchemXML2CML (already available in JUMBO)
</I>&gt;<i>   - convert CML to Gaussian input. We have an XSLT script, but could
</I>&gt;<i> convert this to Java in an hour.
</I>&gt;<i>   - in parallel - create RDF metadata for provenance to this point (as this
</I>&gt;<i> does not survive the Gaussian run)
</I>&gt;<i>   ... submit and run job ... (IU) ... and collect results
</I>&gt;<i>  - convert LOG file to CML (JUMBOMarker, effectively done)
</I>&gt;<i>  - convert CML to RDF (JUMBO). Add GaussianOWL dictionary in RDF
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> upload RDFs into reopository/tripleStore
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In (b) we would expect to get 10,000 - 100,000 small molecules from Pubchem
</I>&gt;<i> of up to, say , 15 first row atoms. These already have 3D coordinates (I am
</I>&gt;<i> ignoring conformers at this stage). The process should be automatic. Jobs
</I>&gt;<i> take from 0.1 seconds to 1 day (probably) as they scale with N^4.
