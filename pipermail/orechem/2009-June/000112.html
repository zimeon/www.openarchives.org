<PRE>no worries Peter, understood. If anybody needs anything from me beyond what's
in our paper &amp; at the wiki already -&gt;
<A HREF="http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/ChemistryDataExtraction,">http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/ChemistryDataExtraction,</A> do let me
know...

I'm going to start taking a look at the AI/search possibilities of our fitted
spectra database then -&gt; <A HREF="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci950092p">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci950092p</A>

</I>&gt;<i>Great - that's exciting Bill and I am sure that it will be invaluable for
</I>assignment. However I am focusssing on what we can integrate today. The
integration problems are not trivial and the more that the components - or the
sites - are modularised the faster progress we shall
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's important to be pragmatic at this stage - there are things we can do now
</I>and things that are research. We should do both but we must make sure that the
infrastructure continues in a straight line. I detailed what we could do at
present (some as rough proof of concept) that could fit into a linear workflow.
We must make sure that the research efforts in the pipeline I indicated are
small as the integration of itself will still be challenging. 
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So I am propopsing that we should ask:
</I>&gt;<i>* what can we do by Friday 19?
</I>&gt;<i>* what can we do by the start of August?
</I>&gt;<i>* what can we do in the rest of the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Each part depends on the previous one:
</I>&gt;<i>* Mark needs a few papers from Lee/Prasenjit which have good PDF chemistry
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
* PMR needs a few molecules and spectra in SVG
&gt;<i>* Marlon needs a few CML molecules and the NMREye workflow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I agree that Mark's work on general PDF parsing is exciting but we need a
</I>stream of molecules for the later stages.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am also going to suggest that we try to arrange weekly telcons to review
</I>progress. The problem of a pipeline/workflow is that all bits have to be
delivering.

</I>&gt;<i>I would also add that there's some mileage in

morning, there is strong application of his graph mining work to building up
complicated spectra on the basis of simpler (sub)spectra...

</I>&gt;<i>This is to review the subprojects
</I>that the computational geeks in OREChem have put together over the last few
days. (a) is long term, (b) is immediate
&gt;<i>(a) The general goal is to compute
</I>NMR spectra for all new published compounds and compare them with spectra. This
is a new approach &quot;robot refereeing of chemistry publications&quot; and any
differences suggest errors or new chemistry. This is long term (months) and
consists of the following (as we have put on the wiki):
&gt;<i>
</I>* PSU-Lee/Prasenjit retrieve chemistry-rich docs from publisher sites (ask for
forgiveness policy) and segment the papers into text+non-text (tables,
diagrams). This passes to:
&gt;<i>* Mark - Soton extracts molecules and spectra out
</I>of this and converts them to SVG. The short-term goal is to get this working by
the end of next week in a pragmatic form. (we do not mind if recall is poor as
long as we get a few SVGs as we need to develop the machine-learning and/or
heuristics and find out what unknown horrors we have to deal with. 
&gt;<i>
</I>Bitmaps are rejected at this stage
&gt;<i>* PMR- cambridge develops heuristics to
</I>interpret (i) molecules (ii) spectra (C13 and H1). These might later be
crowdsourced. The output is CML molecules and spectra. It is unlikely we have
assignments
&gt;<i>
</I>* PSU - Bill+Karl. Analyse spectra with peak-fitting. 
&gt;<i>* IU - Marlon.
</I>(independently) molecules are passed to IU in CML and put into the NMREye
workflow for computing peaks (below). IU run this automatically and return
results in CML
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(b) To get IU up to speed we shall start immediately on
</I>simple molecules from Pubchem. This involves just Cambridge and IU.
&gt;<i>* The
</I>NMREye workflow has been developed and tested and should work on simple organic
compounds. It consists of the following:
&gt;<i>
</I>  - convert PubchemXML2CML (already available in JUMBO)
&gt;<i>  -
</I>convert CML to Gaussian input. We have an XSLT script, but could convert this
to Java in an hour.
&gt;<i>  - in parallel - create RDF metadata for
</I>provenance to this point (as this does not survive the Gaussian run)
&gt;<i>
</I>  ... submit and run job ... (IU) ... and collect results
&gt;<i> -
</I>convert LOG file to CML (JUMBOMarker, effectively done)
&gt;<i> - convert CML
</I>to RDF (JUMBO). Add GaussianOWL dictionary in RDF
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>upload RDFs into
</I>reopository/tripleStore
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In (b) we would expect to get 10,000 - 100,000
</I>small molecules from Pubchem of up to, say , 15 first row atoms. These already
have 3D coordinates (I am ignoring conformers at this stage). The process
should be automatic. Jobs take from 0.1 seconds to 1 day (probably) as they
scale with N^4.
