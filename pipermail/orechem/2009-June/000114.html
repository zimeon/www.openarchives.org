<PRE>Dr Brouwer,

Things have come a long way since the 1996 article you reference. For a modern review regarding automated structure elucidation I refer you to:

 M. E. Elyashberg, A. J. Williams, and G. E. Martin. Computer-Assisted Structure Verification and Elucidation Tools In NMR-Based Structure Elucidation. Review article. Progress in NMR Spectroscopy (2007) 10.1016/j.pnmrs.2007.04.003

As one of the authors of this work feel free to contact me at the email address below and I can provide some guidance regarding where automated structure elucidation is today. There are commercial products on the market today and Christoph Steinbeck from EBI has his own work going on in this area. Peter knows him well I believe. Chris also has Open SOurce NMR prediction tools online at NMRSHiftDB that you might be interested in using.

As the product manager for a CASE system (Computer Assisted Structure Elucidation) for many years I can say that the challenge is not easy but that there has been a lot of progress made over the years. SOme other papers that might interest you (excuse the numbers...snipped out of my CV).

On ChemSpider we will be integrating Chris Steinbeck's NMR shift prediction technology in the near future we hope. Best wishes.

no worries Peter, understood. If anybody needs anything from me beyond what's in our paper &amp; at the wiki already -&gt; <A HREF="http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/ChemistryDataExtraction,">http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem/wiki/ChemistryDataExtraction,</A> do let me know...

I'm going to start taking a look at the AI/search possibilities of our fitted spectra database then -&gt; <A HREF="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci950092p">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci950092p</A>

Great - that's exciting Bill and I am sure that it will be invaluable for assignment. However I am focusssing on what we can integrate today. The integration problems are not trivial and the more that the components - or the sites - are modularised the faster progress we shall

It's important to be pragmatic at this stage - there are things we can do now and things that are research. We should do both but we must make sure that the infrastructure continues in a straight line. I detailed what we could do at present (some as rough proof of concept) that could fit into a linear workflow. We must make sure that the research efforts in the pipeline I indicated are small as the integration of itself will still be challenging.

So I am propopsing that we should ask:
* what can we do by Friday 19?
* what can we do by the start of August?
* what can we do in the rest of the project.

Each part depends on the previous one:
* Mark needs a few papers from Lee/Prasenjit which have good PDF chemistry
* PMR needs a few molecules and spectra in SVG
* Marlon needs a few CML molecules and the NMREye workflow.

I agree that Mark's work on general PDF parsing is exciting but we need a stream of molecules for the later stages.

I am also going to suggest that we try to arrange weekly telcons to review progress. The problem of a pipeline/workflow is that all bits have to be delivering.

cool peter...

I would also add that there's some mileage in substructure &amp; similarity search on spectra. Han gave a great talk this morning, there is strong application of his graph mining work to building up complicated spectra on the basis of simpler (sub)spectra...

This is to review the subprojects that the computational geeks in OREChem have put together over the last few days. (a) is long term, (b) is immediate
(a) The general goal is to compute NMR spectra for all new published compounds and compare them with spectra. This is a new approach &quot;robot refereeing of chemistry publications&quot; and any differences suggest errors or new chemistry. This is long term (months) and consists of the following (as we have put on the wiki):
* PSU-Lee/Prasenjit retrieve chemistry-rich docs from publisher sites (ask for forgiveness policy) and segment the papers into text+non-text (tables, diagrams). This passes to:
* Mark - Soton extracts molecules and spectra out of this and converts them to SVG. The short-term goal is to get this working by the end of next week in a pragmatic form. (we do not mind if recall is poor as long as we get a few SVGs as we need to develop the machine-learning and/or heuristics and find out what unknown horrors we have to deal with.
Bitmaps are rejected at this stage
* PMR- cambridge develops heuristics to interpret (i) molecules (ii) spectra (C13 and H1). These might later be crowdsourced. The output is CML molecules and spectra. It is unlikely we have assignments
* PSU - Bill+Karl. Analyse spectra with peak-fitting.
* IU - Marlon. (independently) molecules are passed to IU in CML and put into the NMREye workflow for computing peaks (below). IU run this automatically and return results in CML

(b) To get IU up to speed we shall start immediately on simple molecules from Pubchem. This involves just Cambridge and IU.
* The NMREye workflow has been developed and tested and should work on simple organic compounds. It consists of the following:
  - convert PubchemXML2CML (already available in JUMBO)
  - convert CML to Gaussian input. We have an XSLT script, but could convert this to Java in an hour.
  - in parallel - create RDF metadata for provenance to this point (as this does not survive the Gaussian run)
  ... submit and run job ... (IU) ... and collect results
 - convert LOG file to CML (JUMBOMarker, effectively done)
 - convert CML to RDF (JUMBO). Add GaussianOWL dictionary in RDF

upload RDFs into reopository/tripleStore

In (b) we would expect to get 10,000 - 100,000 small molecules from Pubchem of up to, say , 15 first row atoms. These already have 3D coordinates (I am ignoring conformers at this stage). The process should be automatic. Jobs take from 0.1 seconds to 1 day (probably) as they scale with N^4.

P.

I will try to send this to the Wiki
