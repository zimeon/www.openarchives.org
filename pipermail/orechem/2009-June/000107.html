<PRE>cool peter...

I would also add that there's some mileage in substructure &amp; similarity search
on spectra. Han gave a great talk this morning, there is strong application of
his graph mining work to building up complicated spectra on the basis of
simpler (sub)spectra...

</I>&gt;<i>This is to review the subprojects that the computational geeks in OREChem have
</I>put together over the last few days. (a) is long term, (b) is immediate
&gt;<i>(a) The general goal is to compute NMR spectra for all new published compounds
</I>and compare them with spectra. This is a new approach &quot;robot refereeing of
chemistry publications&quot; and any differences suggest errors or new chemistry.
This is long term (months) and consists of the following (as we have put on the
wiki):
&gt;<i>
</I>* PSU-Lee/Prasenjit retrieve chemistry-rich docs from publisher sites (ask for
forgiveness policy) and segment the papers into text+non-text (tables,
diagrams). This passes to:
&gt;<i>* Mark - Soton extracts molecules and spectra out of this and converts them to
</I>SVG. The short-term goal is to get this working by the end of next week in a
pragmatic form. (we do not mind if recall is poor as long as we get a few SVGs
as we need to develop the machine-learning and/or heuristics and find out what
unknown horrors we have to deal with. 
&gt;<i>
</I>Bitmaps are rejected at this stage
&gt;<i>* PMR- cambridge develops heuristics to interpret (i) molecules (ii) spectra
</I>(C13 and H1). These might later be crowdsourced. The output is CML molecules
and spectra. It is unlikely we have assignments
&gt;<i>
</I>* PSU - Bill+Karl. Analyse spectra with peak-fitting. 
&gt;<i>* IU - Marlon. (independently) molecules are passed to IU in CML and put into
</I>the NMREye workflow for computing peaks (below). IU run this automatically and
return results in CML
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(b) To get IU up to speed we shall start immediately on simple molecules from
</I>Pubchem. This involves just Cambridge and IU.
&gt;<i>* The NMREye workflow has been developed and tested and should work on simple
</I>organic compounds. It consists of the following:
&gt;<i>
</I>  - convert PubchemXML2CML (already available in JUMBO)
&gt;<i>  - convert CML to Gaussian input. We have an XSLT script, but could convert
</I>this to Java in an hour.
&gt;<i>  - in parallel - create RDF metadata for provenance to this point (as this
</I>does not survive the Gaussian run)
&gt;<i>
</I>  ... submit and run job ... (IU) ... and collect results
&gt;<i> - convert LOG file to CML (JUMBOMarker, effectively done)
</I>&gt;<i> - convert CML to RDF (JUMBO). Add GaussianOWL dictionary in RDF
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>upload RDFs into reopository/tripleStore
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In (b) we would expect to get 10,000 - 100,000 small molecules from Pubchem of
</I>up to, say , 15 first row atoms. These already have 3D coordinates (I am
ignoring conformers at this stage). The process should be automatic. Jobs take
from 0.1 seconds to 1 day (probably) as they scale with N^4.
