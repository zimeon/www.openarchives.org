Carl,

I thought at the telcon we decided to go for the Wed.  Neither Simon or I can come for either day but we are sending Mark Borkum to cover the Southampton contributions and he will also be at the MS meeting and has requested MS book him flights to bring him to CMU in time for a Wed  meeting and depart Sun.

Dates and times for the AHM and IEEE meetings are becoming clear so I hope to have answer soon about when would be a good time to hold the OREChem meeting in Oxford.

Best wishes
Jeremy (in Berlin having talked a bit about ORE)

Even though all have not responded, the overwhelming sentiment is in  
favor of  Wednesday.  Plan to start at 9AM. I'll send out an agenda  
and logistics nearer to the date.

Also, I'd like to have a planning phone call the week before. Please

All,
Please make every effort to participate in this planning phone call (Carl is still waiting on the RSVPs via Doodle; link below) as well as your in-person participation at the oreChem pre-conference on 10/14 in Pittsburgh, PA (prior to the Microsoft eScience meeting).  

I would like to remind you that your ACTIVE participation in these events is CRUCIAL to the overall success of this important project, and although this is a busy time for all of us - it is important that you (or a designate) are engaged.  

Please let me know if there are ANY issues or concerns.  I am looking forward to seeing all of you in Pittsburgh on the 14th!
-jld
