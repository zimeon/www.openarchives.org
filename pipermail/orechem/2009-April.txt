As promised at our recent meeting, here is a poll for our next phone  
call when we will report progress on the action items from meeting.   
Jane, we realize you probably won't be able to make this time.  Sorry,  
but the UK folks wanted an earlier time for them.

Interesting.  I sent this during our meeting in Redmond 2 weeks ago.  Did something just happen on the listserv to unclog the tubes?   ---Alex

Subject: [Orechem] Next all group conference call
Message-ID: <54CC7905-63D3-4F6F-8FAA-D7AB0E7F0BFB@gmail.com>

  colleagues,

Our next all group conference call will take place at noon, 12 PM (US  
Eastern time) on Thursday, April 30. Our main subject of discussion at  
that meeting will be report on progress on the action item defined at  
our face-to-face meeting in March. That is, the definition of an  
exchange syntax/protocol, and the modeling of both document centric  
and molecule centric entities based on Nico's ontology. Please recall  
that we had determined that we will have demonstrators of these done  
by our June face-to-face meeting at Penn State.

I will send out call in instructions shortly before the call.

Best, Carl

Message-ID: <0CE3BEE5-EE82-4BBF-B38F-8094B098EB33@gmail.com>

At our previous face-to-face meeting in Redmond we had discussed  
scheduling a subsequent meeting on June 10 in Penn State in  
conjunction with a workshop that Carl Mueller is putting together. The  
workshop, chemistry in the digital age: a workshop connecting research  
and education, is definitely going to happen now on June 11 and 12th.  
Please let me know as soon as possible if you are available for a  
meeting of our group on June 10. I imagine that not all of us will be  
able to make that date, but it would be great if a subset of us  
including representatives of each institution could attend. Once I get  
a roll call I can plan logistics and send you more information.

Carl

All:

If you are planning to attend the PSU workshop, please also let me 
know.  I have some funds available for travel, and can fund at least one 
person per institution to come to the workshop.  You will probably just 
have to pay for one night lodging and meals on the oreChem meeting day 
from your Microsoft funds.  But, as things evolve, this may even be 
covered - I am still waiting to hear about a few outstanding requests 
for funding.

Best,

Karl (which Carl will eventually figure out how to spell)
