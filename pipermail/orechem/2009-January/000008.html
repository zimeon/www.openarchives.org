<PRE>Things are never as easy as they seem!
But, I'm happy to say we now have a project management site at <A HREF="http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem">http://services.nsdl.org/trac/oreChem</A> 
.  You need to login to access all its features.  Each of you has your  
own login - first initial, last name.  So, Jane Hunter is jhunter,  
Simon Coles is scoles (I think you see the pattern).  Everyone has the  
same password &quot;orechem09&quot;.  Needless, to say , use your own login and  
if someone else in your group needs access, let me know and we'll give  
them a login.  Its nice to know exactly is doing things.

As configured, everyone in the group can modify the wiki, manipulate  
tickets and reports, and view the subversion repository.  I still need  
to get my SA folks to give http access for svn operations - that will  
come soon.

You will note that I've had a quick start on wiki content. Obviously,  
much more needs to be done.  But at least we are now live.

Also, please remember our phone call at 1600 GMT-5 on January 27, 2009  
(Today for all but Jane).

Carl
