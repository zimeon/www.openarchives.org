Hussein, Peter, all,

OCLC's intent is to do what we did at University of Michigan, harvest the
metadata. It is not the intent to go beyond that to capture the content
itself. OCLC is working with their legal department on this issue.
Unfortunately, that is all I can offer at the moment. I will provide more as
it comes available.

Regards,
 -Kat

The fact that that's exactly what they say they are going to do we can  
probably pass off as a consequence of having a more pro-active  
marketing department than legal department (thank heavens!)

However, that sort of cast-iron legal guarantee cannot confidently be  
granted to a third party for even the metadata.

No, I think it was boilerplate. They are working on it.

I will forward that to them.

No, they will not. It is not a requirement to sign that form. My guess is
they will move quickly to change this, but that is only IMO.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] oai2xmpp
Message-ID: <f032cc060909232124v51e5dd77ja4ade8dced905fdd@mail.gmail.com>

As an experiment to learn more about XMPP I created a little utility
that will poll an oai-pmh server and send new records as a chunk of
xml over XMPP.  The idea wasn't necessarily to see all the xml coming
into your jabber client (although you can do that), but to enable
downstream applications to have records pushed to them, instead of
them constantly having to poll for updates. So for example you could
create an archiver that sat and listened for new updates, or a current
awareness bot that scanned for articles that matched some user
profile, etc...

For example you can:

  oai2xmpp.py http://www.doaj.org/oai.article from@example.com to@example.org

which would poll DOAJ for new articles every 10 minutes and send them
via xmpp to to@example.org. You can adjust the poll interval, and
limit to records within a particular set with the --pollinterval and
--set options, e.g.:

  oai2xmpp.py http://export.arxiv.org/oai2 currents@jabber.org
ehs@jabber.org --set cs --pollinterval 86400

It's a one file python hack in the spirit of Thom Hickey's 2PageOAI
[1] that has a few dependencies documented in the file (lxml, xmpppy,
httplib2). You can find it here:

  http://inkdroid.org/bzr/currents/oai2xmpp.py

Which is actually a bazaar repository that you can branch if you like:

  bzr branch http://inkdroid.org/bzr/currents

If you try it out, have an improvements, or ideas let me know. There's
a short TODO section in the file's documentation that describes some
potential things that could be done.
