hi

as we approach closure on v2.0 of OAI-PMH, there are a few very minor 
outstanding issues ... one that i have wondered about for a while now 
relates to requestURL.

for those who have implemented service or data providers for the OAI 
protocol:
   have you used the requestURL at all, and if so, how ?

if the answer is yes, please reply directly to me as soon as possible - 
i will collate and post a summary to the list (and send it to the 
technical committee as well).

thanx,
----hussein

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Beta Release: DOG - The Dienst Open-Archive Gateway
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.10.10205032113180.5157-100000@ren.cs.odu.edu>

Beta Release: DOG - The Dienst 4.1  Open-Archive 1.1  Gateway
_____________________________________________________________


I am happy  to announce  the Beta release of DOG - The Dienst (4.1) to
Open-Archive (1.1) Gateway for community evaluation.  This project was
built with the support of Mohammad Zubair (ODU) and Dr. Michael Nelson
(NASA).

Test Site:      http://www.cs.odu.edu/~tharriso/DOG/gateway.html


Purpose
________________
The purpose of DOG is to make it possible for OAI enabled services to make
requests to, and permit harvesting of, any archive that supports Dienst
4.1 protocol requests, by using OAI 1.1 formatted requests. This service
may be used to make OAI calls to any Dienst archive. This service is
offered to the digital library community at large and may be called
remotely (to our server at ODU), or may be installed locally (at
conclusion of Beta review).


Features
________________
1.  Permits OAI calls to Dienst servers that support Dienst 4.1 protocol
    requests.
2.  Handles all OAI 1.1 verb request and all verb arguments.
    example: "until" argument implemented ( where no equivalent exists in
    Dienst 4.1)
3.  Requests for records (GetRecord) may be made with either Dienst
    formatted handle or OAI formatted  identifier.
4.  Handles archives that contain multiple repository identifiers.


Basic Request Format
_______________
http://pitfall.cs.odu.edu:5187/servlet/dataprovider.Gateway/DIENST_SERVER%2FDien
st%2F/


Testing
______________
Dog has been tested on:
www.icase.edu
ncstrl.mit.edu
ncstrl.gmd.de
dienst.iei.pi.cnr.it

The URL at the top of this message will take you to the DOG Test Site.
Your feedback is welcomed.  



Summary
______________
The goal of this project is to create a gateway between OAI 1.1 protocol
and the Dienst 4.1 Protocol. It is worthy to note that the scope of this
gateway is limited to scope of the OAI protocol and does not include
auxiliary services that may exist within a Dienst framework. 

DOG has been written in JAVA and will be available (after BETA testing) to
interested parties, as a tar file, for optional local implementation. It
is not necessary to install DOG locally, as calls may be made it directly
as currently implemented at ODU. It is currently being run on a BETA
server at Old Dominion University, and will more to a more permanent
location at the conclusion of BETA testing.   


I look forward to your comments,

Terry Harrison

Message-ID: <3CD6D984.6174EFB3@perseus.tufts.edu>

Announcing Perseus Open Archives Initiative Services (6 May 2002)

The Perseus Project is pleased to announce the first release of its Open
Archives Initiative service provider. The Perseus system harvests
registered OAI repositories and incorporates the information into its
search interface (http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor).

Some sample searches: 

- search for "Shakespeare", grouped by collection. Note that not all
resources have web-accessible content.
http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?lookup=Shakespeare;group=collcat;extern=1

- search for "cloning", dynamically clustered by repeated phrases. Note
the different phrases associated with cloning: "molecular cloning",
"amino acid", "quantum information".
http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?lookup=cloning;group=stcluster;extern=1

- search for "Goethe", grouped by matching field. Books by Goethe are
separated from information about Goethe. 
http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?lookup=Goethe;group=fieldcat;extern=1

For documents that are web-accessible, Perseus creates two links: one
directly to the outside page, and one with added Perseus links. As with
texts in Perseus, these links point back to related resources in the
digital library. 

Please send comments to dasmith@perseus.tufts.edu

hi

thanks to all who replied.

as a quick summary,

i got 7 responses. 3 are data providers and implemented requestURL (as 
is required of all data providers). 4 are service providers and do not 
use it.

this is being passed on to the technical committee, but do note that 
since it is late in the development cycle, this will likely have no 
effect on v2 when it is released.

 I know this is a simple and perhaps stupid question, but I'd rather
*look* stupid than *be* stupid.  We have some confusion over here:

 Do the Dublin Core elements describe the original item, or the
    digitized objects made from that item?

The DC webpages simply say all the elements refer to the "resource",
but I'm not clear as to whether that "resource" is the digital one,
or the  original item.

 Example:
   A multi-page letter, written in 1869, is the original document;
   An SGML transcription with accompanying JPEGs for each page,
      comprise the digitized object.

 Does the "date" element refer to the creation of the digitized object,
   or the date the letter was written?
 Does the "creator" refer to the person who scanned the document and
   transcribed its contents, or does it refer to the original author
   of the letter?
 Does the "format" list text/sgml and JPEGS, or simply text?  And
   if this original document was an old JPEG about which metadata
   was created, is the correct format JPEG and that metadata format?
   Or just "photgraph"?


 I have found we have a mix of both in our files at present, and I need
 some clarity so I can clean up this mess and prevent future madness!!

In unqualified DC it's the original item.  You need richer metadata 
to also include information about the digitized object.

Jody-

In my experience the question is not stupid, nor is the answer simple and
uncontroversial, nor is any one practice or solution to this problem
universally implemented.

Unqualified DC is inherently imprecise about the distinctions you're making.
We harvest from about 15 registered OAI metadata providers and deal as well
with metadata from about another dozen institutions. Practices are
inconsistent. Some providers use DC elements to describe only the digital
incarnation of a work, some describe only the physical incarnation of a work
(usually because a digital incarnation doesn't exist), most describe
attributes of both physical and digital incarnations in a single metadata
record.

As noted in a previous response, qualified DC allows you to be more precise
and better distinguish between the physical and the digital incarnations in
the space of a single metadata record; however, I disagree that unqualified
DC is inappropriate for describing attributes of a digital version of a
physical object. It is frequently used to describe digital incarnations of
physical objects. (See also the answer to the FAQ #12, Was Dublin Core
metadata designed to be used only to describe digital and Web-based
resources? on the DCMI site, http://dublincore.org/resources/faq/)  The
question of how you do this well, however, is tricky. How much information
about the physical incarnation do you include when describing the digital
incarnation?

An approach that has received some attention in the past is the 1 to 1
approach (1 metadata record for each and every resource, where the physical
and the digital incarnations would be considered separate and distinct,
albeit related resources). Some examples of possible ways to deal with this
issue consistent with that approach are given in, for instance, the CIMI
Guide to Best Practice for Dublin Core
(http://www.cimi.org/public_docs/meta_bestprac_v1_1_210400.pdf). See in
particular the examples in Appendix A. Though focused on usage within the
museum community, these examples might be of interest.

However, there are limitations to a purely 1 to 1 approach, particularly for
cross-domain discovery at this point in time using a protocol like the OAI
PMH. Another approach that we've seen used by many OAI providers is to risk
confusion and ambiguity by describing attributes of both the digital and the
physical incarnations all mixed together in a single metadata record. Thus a
single record may include two DC Date elements, one that is the date of
manufacture for the physical object and one that is the date of the creation
of the digital object. The same record may contain 2 DC Creator elements,
one with the name of the original artist, and one the name of the person who
digitized the work. In unqualified DC there is no machine understandable way
to distinguish meaning between the 2 Dates or 2 Creators, however, many
implementers include labels in their DC Date and Creator values that are at
least human understandable.

A slightly more sophisticated approach, more like the 1 to 1 approach but
not quite that extreme, is to include attributes about both the physical and
the digital in a single record, but in doing so try to make distinctions
between original physical incarnation attributes and derived digital
incarnation attributes through how certain DC elements are used. Thus the
year a physical artifact was created might show up under DC Coverage, while
only the date the digitization was done shows under DC Date. Or a digital
representation of a 3-dimensional sculpture might list as a DC Creator the
photographer who took the digital photograph and list the sculptor of the
piece as a DC Contributor (instead of DC Creator). Source and relation tags
can also be used to help distinguish between the attributes of the digital
incarnation and the physical incarnation of a single intellectual work.
We're seeing this less frequently, but when done consistently across a wide
enough domain it potentially would support more precise searches.

An interesting discussion of some of these issues appeared in a D-Lib
Magazine article by Carl Lagoze
http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january01/lagoze/01lagoze.html

Anyway, the bottom line is that this issue remains a difficult one and is a
hindrance to more effective cross-domain aggregation of metadata. There's
lots of opportunity to try and improve the situation, but I don't think
we're yet at a stage where there's universal agreement, so you may not have
a simple answer. Look at what's been done in other domains and by other
implementers and try to take a sensible approach that builds on those
approaches and the limited degree of consensus that has been built so far.

Hi, Kevin--

What you have said supports my understanding of the <about> tag 
"as a means to provide information regarding the origins of the metadata
part of the record".  
(http://www.openarchives.org/OAI_protocol/2.x/openarchivesprotocol.htm)

Let me see if I understand your position correctly:

If the item under discussion is an issue of a slavery-era local
newspaper, (such as our Emancipator set) the "publisher" and "rights"
fields are those that apply to the original newspaper;  "creator" would
perhaps be the company or editor; format would be (perhaps)
newsprint; "date" would be the date of original printing.

   Then, perhaps in the <about> tag section, information would be entered
such as current rights access to the digitized material;  publisher of the
digitzation;  creator of the digitized object;  date of digitization,
and here, format might be SGML and/or JPEG.

Thus, if the item under discussion were a book, the "identifier" in the
regular dc section would likely be the ISBN, whereas the "identifier" in
the "about" section would likely be the unique OAI identifier, the URL at
which the digitized object(s) could be viewed, a CORC ID, and so on.

Am I understanding you correctly?

And then if the oai_dc file were to be translated into a QUALIFIED Dublin
Core record, the information in the "about" tag section would somehow be
incorporated with the information in the rest of the file???


Thank you for your time and clarification.

Jody

The <about> is for information about the harvested metadata, particularly
the intellectual rights and the origin, NOT for the resource.

Tim Cole, in another email reply, has provided a useful review of the issues
over whether the metadata describes the original resource or the digitized
object.  There are ways that DC, particularly the source and relation
elements, can be used to 'solve' this problem. However, unless there is a
common approach, there will be interoperability problems for resource
discovery when searching against metadata harvested from different OAI
providers.

My thinking is that having metadata describe the original item is the
simplest and most acceptable approach; the original item might, of course,
be in digital format.  The only difference between the metadata of a
physical item and a digital manifestation would be the format, which could
be SGML or JPEG for the digital object.  If the intellectual content of the
digital object differs from the original then the metadata should describe
the digital object, the date element being the creation date of the digital
object. 

The 2 examples in section 5 of the OAI-PMH 2.0 beta
(http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm) follow this
approach, although an available date is included in the second example.  

Some of the draft DC-Library Application Profile
(http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/library-application-profile_200204.html) also
supports this view. For example the mandatory Date Created says "Use for the
creation of the intellectual content".  Perhaps this forum is an appropriate
place for these issues to be resolved whilst the profile is still a draft?
I agree with Tim that when it comes to the museum world, creation date is
probably inappropriate for a rock sample!  Coverage tends to be used more in
this domain. 

What do others think?

Kevin

Let me see if I understand your position correctly:

If the item under discussion is an issue of a slavery-era local
newspaper, (such as our Emancipator set) the "publisher" and "rights"
fields are those that apply to the original newspaper;  "creator" would
perhaps be the company or editor; format would be (perhaps)
newsprint; "date" would be the date of original printing.

   Then, perhaps in the <about> tag section, information would be entered
such as current rights access to the digitized material;  publisher of the
digitzation;  creator of the digitized object;  date of digitization,
and here, format might be SGML and/or JPEG.

Thus, if the item under discussion were a book, the "identifier" in the
regular dc section would likely be the ISBN, whereas the "identifier" in
the "about" section would likely be the unique OAI identifier, the URL at
which the digitized object(s) could be viewed, a CORC ID, and so on.

Am I understanding you correctly?

And then if the oai_dc file were to be translated into a QUALIFIED Dublin
Core record, the information in the "about" tag section would somehow be
incorporated with the information in the rest of the file???


Thank you for your time and clarification.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] BETA version of OAI-PMH v.2.0
Message-ID: <3CE01928.BBCABA8A@lanl.gov>

Dear,

We are pleased to announce the release of the BETA version of the
OAI-PMH v.2.0:

* The BETA protocol document is available at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm .
* Linked from the protocol document is also a migration document
pointing out the major differences between the experimental 1.0/1.1
version of the protocol and version 2.0, which is released as a stable
specification.
* Also linked from the protocol document are Implementation Guidelines,
covering a broad range of topics related to protocol implementation.

This BETA release comes after 16 months of worldwide experimentation
with version 1.x of the protocol, an 8 month revision process by the
OAI-tech group, and 2 months of alpha testing.  We feel confident about
the quality of the resulting specification.  We encourage discussion of
the specification on the oai-implementers list to help us further
improve the specification. Also, we encourage you to inform the list
about v.2.0BETA conformant data provider implementations, when they
become available.  We expect this to be useful to support other
implementations/migrations.

The full release of the OAI-PMH v.2.0 is expected around the middle of
June 2002.  Up until that time we hope to keep the functionality of the
beta specification stable, restricting changes to textual clarifications
and corrections.

Below, preliminary information is provided regarding OAI-PMH v.2.0
conformant tools that will become available by or soon after June 1st
2002.  They will be listed on the Open Archives website as they become
available.

Thank-you for the clarification, Kevin.  I like your approach.  It
removes the ambiguity from constructing records, and allows for
meaningful search results --- once consensus and compliance are reached.

I understand it means a lot of work in reconstructing existing records,
but better now than a few million records down the road...

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0205141730110.16288-100000@hydra2a.cs.utk.edu>

I need to make some decisions here, and would like to hear from
folks more experienced than I, before I do so.

My dilemma relates to 2 things:
 1) in the Migration Document: Set: Textual Changes:
    " If a repository supports sets, the header of a record must
   indicate the set membership of the item from which that record was
   disseminated."
 2) some of our records are beginning to be included in multiple sets.

The dilemma is: how to implement the database to return records in a
timely manner, and be scalable.

If I allow a record to be in 0-5 sets, and the set fields are in the
same table as the record fields, 5 selects on the same table are required
to respond to a single ListRecord request with set argument.

If I put the sets in a secondary table, pull out all the identifiers for
a given set (same request), then when I have a request for ListRecords
*without* a set argument, I need to do a select on the set table for each
record returned in the ListRecord response.

Am I missing a plausible option here?
I would be grateful for suggestions.

Maybe I should forget the sets altogether.  For those of you with
harvesters and search engines:  how do you use the repository sets
 (or do you?)
(Oh, and if you can recommend which ListRecord fields you have found
useful, I'd like to hear about that also;  I'd like to standardize my
returns.)

Thanks!!

I actually don't have a suggestion here. The database engine I am using
(ours! :-) supports nested repeating structures, so we can store and index
multiple sets directly in the record without problem. For a relational
database, what you are saying makes sense.

If you want a hacky suggestion, you could have a field in the same table
as the record which contains all the set names (separated by say spaces
or commas) so when you fetch the record you can return the set names
efficently, but to allow efficient querying have a redundant separate table
of set names which can be joined back to the main record table. But I
am not speaking with any experience here.

Our intent is to left our implementation be configured so the person
controlling the harvest selects which sets to use. The idea as I
understand it is so a Museum with lots of different sorts of information
can make it all available, but a physics department could harvest from
lots of different sources information only relating to physics (eg:
how physics are used in carbon dating or something). But its up to
the data provider to define sets, then up to the harvester to decide
which sets look interesting.

I plan to keep the whole <record> in the database and so let applications
use what they want out of it. So I guess I would encourage you to return
as much as you can. Is there some specific areas you had in mind?

Hope this was a little help,
Alan

Alan, you beat me to it ... you were writing while i was thinking :)

i don't actually do the redundant table thingy yet because i don't have 
any general oai2 implementations, but it's what i would try first.

Thank you, Alan!  (and Hussein!)

I will certainly consider your hack, as it's a huge improvement over
redundant records or multiple selects.

Right now, what we put in ListRecord returns varies;  I'd like to
standardize it, but there appear to be no guidelines.  I would like to
return less than GetRecord, but am wondering if perhaps I should return
the whole enchilada;  currently, the most we return is everything but the
"description" fields (for some sets).

If ListRecords is used by harvesters to gather entire records quickly,
and GetRecord is NOT used much (cumbersome, one record at a time), then
I should want to include all of the record fields.

If however, harvesters are using <subject> fields (or some such) in
ListRecord returns to determine what they want to get as full records
--and ignoring all else -- returning entire records is not worth the
time and work for either end... and then <subject> fields would be
very important (to me) to include.

The 2.0 ListRecord examples only contain the following fields:
title, creator, type, source, language, identifier;  but Hussein tells
me there are no actual guidelines for this.

hi

hmmm ... an interesting interpretation ...

but as most people understand the protocol (v1.0, v1.1, and v2.0),
a record (everything between <record> and </record>) as returned by 
ListRecords should be identical to the same record requested by its 
identifier using GetRecord, for a given metadataPrefix (assuming no 
dynamic updating between requests).

so, if i submit a ListRecords request for oai_dc and i get a record with 
identifier xyz, i can then submit a GetRecord request with xyz/oai_dc 
and get the same identical record back. most service providers and 
harvesters will make this assumption so even if it is not explicitly 
stated in the protocol spec, it may be prudent to adopt it as best 
practice :)

Gosh, Hussein, I guess you just have to spell things out for
people like me.

  Thank you for the clarification!  I simply did not read it
that way.  As I did not know the reasons behind the choices of
the verbs (and their arguments)-- and the examples for each
seem to always differ in fields returned (in the specs)--- I
supposed that ListRecord and GetRecord were completely different
animals, instead of one being a subset of the other.

  Good thing I asked!!

   ;-)

For DC metadata, I think some fields like "title","creator", "subject" and
"abstract" are widely used for building advanced search interface in
resource discovery.

The other fields like "rights" may not be widely used in search interface,
but they can be shown in search result page whenever the resource is
discovered.

For community or archive specific metadata, it will be difficult for a
general service provider to exploit the semantics, but I think the
"branding" introduced in 2.0 brings a new way for service provider to
present the information even if it doesn't understand the meanings.

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-branding.htm

My personal view is the more information, the better.

regards,
liu

I would add to Xiaoming's list "identifier", both as a URL from which the
resource can be obtained, and, if the resource is a published article, the
location of the published version.

I would strongly suggest using the "Family-name, Forenames" format for
creator and "yyyy-mm-dd" style dates (rather than "september 2000").

(n.b. "abstract" should go into DC "description")

Tim.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Metadata where the full text is unavailable
Message-ID: <20020516111704.D18622@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

Hi, I'm actually creating an OAI archive for a change, rather than just
building software to do it.

Our department archive is not yet OAI compliant (bows head in shame) but
will be soon. The issue is that I've got 7000 metadata records but only
a fraction of these have the full-text in electronic format associated with
them. Some of these are *only* archived and may not be made available on
the web.

It's fustrating for people to find a record and then be unable to get the
full text.

Should I:
 a) Export ALL metadata via OAI regardless of availability of full text
 b) (This is my provisional plan) Only export OAI metadata for records
     for which the full text is publically accessable.
 c) Somehow indicate in the metadata if the full text is unavailable.

It's an unusual situation, but the archive is used as a public service,
a department archive (so we don't lose the electronic copy, even if it's
not public), and used to keep track of the publications of department 
members for statistics, CV's etc.

Hi all,

Just a quick announcement that we have a beta release of our OAI 2.0
compliant Visual Basic Harvesting Object Library available.

It is available for download from SourceForge at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47963&release_id=89921

This is an ActiveX COMponent that can be used to write programs that harvest
from OAI compliant providers.  It supports 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 version of the
protocol.  Included is a simple command line script called 'reap' that
illustrates how to use the ActiveX COMponent to harvest from OAI providers
and store the metadata records onto the file system.

The API used by the ActiveX COMponent also includes fairly detailed
documentation.

Our Java version of these components will be available shortly.

Comments, questions, or bug reports are extremely welcome.

Thanks,

Hi
In a GetRecord example

We have
<OAI-PMH xmlns="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/" 
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/
         http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/OAI-PMH.xsd">


and then later


<oai_dc:dc 
         xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" 
         xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ 
         http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd">


Is the second occurance of 
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
In the dc section redundant?

the xsi namespace should be availabe to children in this case the <dc> 
construct



Thus it could read
<oai_dc:dc 
         xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" 
         xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"

Curtis,

you are definitely right about this.  generally speaking, the second
occurence of the Namespace URI is redundant.  the reason we nevertheless
include it in the dc-part is to make that part self-contained: if you
extract the dc part from the encapsulating OAI-PMH, it still stands as a
document that can be validated.

I hope this helps.

Message-ID: <706871B20764CD449DB0E8E3D81C4D4301F2C805@opus.cs.cornell.edu>

Dear all:

As we move towards a final release of OAI-PMH version 2, we have made a
couple of small changes to the protocol specification posted at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm.  A new
version dated 2002-05-22T16:00:00Z - cjl includes the following:

1. New text at the end of paragraph 1 in section 2.7.1 clarifying error
handling for incorrect from and until arguments for selective harvesting
by datestamp.
2. Elimination of the badGranularity error code. This error code was a
legacy of different granularity specifications in earlier alphas.  The
functionality of the badGranularity error code is now handled by the
badArgument error code.

We will continue to inform you of hopefully small changes up until the
final release.

Folks

I'm new to OAI but I think I have noticed an inconsistency in the
referencing of the .xsd files.

I am working on implementing OAI in PHP and as a start I am working on the
response for the Identify verb.

In my response to the request I had the following...

<oai-identifier
   xmlns="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai-identifier"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai-identifier/
   http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai-identifier.xsd">

as indicated in the current beta2.  Yet when I tried to validate this
using http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv there was an error indicating
the mapping of the schemaLocation was not right.  Looking at the .xsd file
the

xmlns:oai-identifier="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai-identifier

had no trailing "/".  Removing the "/" from my response file cleared up
the problem.

So, should there be a trailing "/" or not?  If you look in the OAI-PMH.xsd
file it has a trailing "/" and thus works with what is in the beta2
document.

Finally, anyone know when there will be a 2.0 version of the repository
explorer at http://www.purl.org/NET/oai_explorer?

Thanks (if i'm not making any sense let me know....)

Stuart,

Thanks for pointing this out.

1. According to the oai-identifier spec at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-oai-identifier.htm , the
namespace should NOT have a trailing '/' .

We will update the example(s) in the protocol document accordingly.

2. I expect Hussein Suleman to provide up-to-date info re the Explorer.

hi

as Carl pointed out earlier, the beta repository explorer is at:
   http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/cgi-bin/Explorer/oai2.0/testoai

i updated it today to correspond to the current spec (and added a few 
more tests) - hence the delay in responding.

for those not familiar with it, the repository explorer is a simple 
client interface for the OAI-PMH, the primary use of which is to help 
with testing of data provider implementations.

if anything doesn't work as you think it should, please let me know.

Message-ID: <3CEE5F6C.BC84B5EC@perseus.tufts.edu>

I apologize if this has been addressed before; chapter and verse in the
archives would be welcome.

I am confused by the interaction of resumptionToken and metadataPrefix
on a ListRecords request. Some data providers will not respond properly
to the resumptionToken unless a metadataPrefix is supplied. Others
appear to object to including metadataPrefix.

I cannot find anything about this in either version of the protocol,
but, again, I could be overlooking something obvious. Although a prudent
harvester would try both options, I would be interested in what seems
best practice for data providers.

Thanks
David

David,

In both 1.x and 2.0, resumpToken is listed in all cases as an
-->exclusive<-- argument, meaning that: "the argument may be included
with request, but must be the only argument (in addition to the verb
argument)."  So, it is incorrect to require or even accept a
metadataPrefix with it.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Hi,

ResumptionToken is *exclusive* - an OAI-compliant harvester must not supply
a metadataPrefix with a resumptionToken.

(As has been mentioned in the past by Herbert, if a prefix could be
supplied, the query could be changed, therefore the result set would be
inconsistent)

If a repository requires a metadataPrefix it isn't OAI-compliant, so either
contact the repository administrator to fix it, or you'll need to code an
explicit "work-around" for broken implementations.

All the best,
Tim.

hi

i should add that as of yesterday, the repository explorer will test 
resumptionToken + metadataPrefix and expect a "badArgument" error response.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.4.10.10205240929490.16696-100000@library.berkeley.edu>

Hello -

	I am in charge of an old NCSTRL node (UC Berkeley) that I moved
about 6 months ago to NCSTRL-Lite. 

	Every step I take in the process of converting is concerned with
getting away from the Dienst software, but I find I still need it.

	Our installation began with a substantial base of documents which
were entered into NCSTRL by scanning; now, we are dependent on the Dienst
thumbnail image -> full page image mapping functions.

	When we moved to NCSTRL-Lite, I managed to point the FTP URLs
required in the metadata to memoized Dienst pages, which allowed me to
continue to use the image mapping functions.

	My question is, what did other NCSTRL sites do? Did they just tar
up their images and let the users download them? are they using Eprints?
are they searching for document viewing options?

	If you are aware of any discussions taking place, I would be
grateful for pointers, or the addresses of anyone who
has had to go through the conversion process.


Any help would be appreciated;

I found the same behaviour. The OAI 1.0/1.1 spec was a bit ambiguous
in its original form (it said metadataPrefx was *required*, and
resumptionToken was *exclusive*). So I know at least one implementation
interpreted the ambiguity as metadataPrefix must always be there
(in addition to the resumptionToken). In OAI 2.0 is been clarified
so that you must not specify metadataPrefix if resumptionToken is
specified. I found *more* OAI 1.0/1.1 servers worked this way than
requiring both resumptionToken and metadataPrefix.

So I would support everyone else's comments and recommend you don't
supply metadataPrefix when you use a resumptionToken.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI Protocol Version 2
Message-ID: <3CF39D36.53A0B57C@cs.cornell.edu>

Hello, all -- we are now open for registering/validating OAI
repositories
at the Version 2.0 level.  In fact, one site has already been registered
as
a version 2 repository.

One change from version 1 is that the notion of compliant and robust
has been dropped.  Compliant sites are expected to recognize and handle
the six verbs as well as the following 13 erroneous requests:

?junk
?verb=junk
?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc
?verb=GetRecord&identifier=(some valid id from your repo)
?verb=GetRecord&identifier=invalid"id&metadataPrefix=oai_dc
?verb=ListIdentifiers&until=junk
?verb=ListIdentifiers&from=junk
?verb=ListIdentifiers&resumptionToken=junk&until=2000-02-05
?verb=ListRecords
?verb=ListRecords&resumptionToken=junk
?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&ResumptionToken=junk&until=1990-01-10

?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&until=junk
?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&from=junk
