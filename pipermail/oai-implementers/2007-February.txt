Subject: [OAI-implementers] Flow Control chunk size
Message-ID: <20070202120031312.00000003604@annapps>

Hi All,

The OAI-PMH spec section 3.5 Flow Control details how to respond to list requests in installments with a resumptionToken. The reason for this partitioning is that lists may be long from a large database. A couple of questions:

1. Are there any guidelines on best practice for what to choose as a chunk size? I guess this question is really asking what size of data package is it reasonable to send over HTTP. 

I currently have a chunk size of 25, some records in a specific XML metadata format being quite long. Someone recently asked me why we supply records 25 at a time, and I do not really have an answer.

2. Is it permissible to have a different chunk size for ListIdentifiers and ListRecords? The former will be a much shorter response than the latter. Also can one have a different chunk size for ListRecords in different metadata formats?

>From the spec this looks to be OK - all the details are contained in the resumptionToken and its XML attributes. But I don't want to implement something that is invalid.

Thanks for any advice.
Best wishes,
	Ann

We use a chunk size of 200 which produces a 40K response to a ListIdentifier
request and a 380K response to a ListRecords request. I think a primary
concern is to maintain acceptable response times when serving up the
records.

In the DLF sponsored OAI best practices work 
(http://oai-best.comm.nsdl.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ResumptionTokens) we 
decided something around 1MB per response was best. This is big enough to 
be reasonably efficient for large transfers (reducing overhead of many 
small requests that may not use a persistent connection) and not too 
large for XML parsers.

This is certainly permissible, commonly done and indeed recommended by
the 1MB response size suggestion.

Simeon
