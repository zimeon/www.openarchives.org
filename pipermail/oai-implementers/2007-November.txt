Apologies for cross-posting

A meeting will be held on March 3, 2008 at Johns Hopkins University to
roll-out the first beta release of the OAI-ORE specifications.  These
specifications describe a data model to identify and describe
aggregations of web resources, and the encoding of the data model in the
XML-based Atom syndication format.

Additional details are available at:

- The full press release for this event:

http://www.openarchives.org/ore/documents/ore-hopkins-press-release.pdf

- The registration site for the meeting:

Not all the name space URL's in the recommended XML schema to represent
MARC21 records found at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-marcxml.htm are
resolvable. 

 

xmlns= http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim goes to a "Page Not Found"

xmlns:xsi= http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance goes to a notice
forbidding the declarations of attributes in this namespace

xsi:schemaLocation= http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim goes to a "Page Not
Found"

 

Should these resolve? What are the correct values if they should? 

 

(I understand the Oxygen xml editor will not validate them.)

 

Thanks,

Hi Neil,

The attribute

 xsi:schemaLocation=
   "http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim 
    http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/schema/MARC21slim.xsd"

means (colloquially) "you can find a schema for things in the namespace
http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim at http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/schema/MARC21slim.xsd"

The namespace URI (http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim) doesn't have to resolve 
to anything. In fact, some would argue that it is better if it doesn't.
The key is that the schema location (http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/schema/MARC21slim.xsd)
does indeed resolve to an XML schema, and does (through its targetNamespace
declaration) provide information for elements in the namespace http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim.

One place to read about these things is the XML Schema Primer 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/), there may be other more readable
descriptions too.

(The reason that HTTP URIs are frequently used as namespaces is that DNS
and domain ownership provides an easy way to guarantee uniqueness provided 
everyone follows the rules of only using HTTP URIs in a domain that they 
control.)

Cheers,
Simeon

At least as far as the W3 Consortium is concerned, it is considered good
practice for namespace URIs to resolve to documents which provide
information about the namespace. 
http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#namespace-document

Of course, if someone defines a namespace and doesn't want to provide a
"namespace document", they may certainly do so, but they should really
use some other URI scheme, such as URN, info, tag, etc, rather than
HTTP, since HTTP URIs ARE supposed to resolve.

The issue raised was not one of good practice, but whether an XML  
processor will validate the document or not. I don't believe that a  
non-resolving namespace URI should affect validation at all.

Granted, although I think Conal was responding to Simeon's assertion
in this thread that:

  The namespace URI (http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim)
  doesn't have to resolve to anything. In fact, some would
  argue that it is better if it doesn't.

I do not doubt that some would argue about it ... but they would be
disagreeing with the notion of namespace documents as expressed in the
AWWW [1].  Given that this is a SHOULD and not a MUST I agree it's
unlikely that a reasonable validator would fail validation based on
the absence of a namespace document -- but you could well imagine a
warning getting triggered.

IMHO it's important for the digital library community to be aware of
where and when it is diverging from current best practices on the
web--and to raise issues with the appropriate bodies (w3c tag, etc) to
change them where they can. It just makes the world-wide-web a saner
place.

1. Expressions of economy

In the works of Spelling, a predominant concept is the distinction  
between masculine and feminine. Therefore, conceptualist situationism  
implies that society, paradoxically, has objective value.

The characteristic theme of Cameron?s[1] analysis of dialectic  
discourse is not narrative per se, but neonarrative. But Baudrillard  
suggests the use of postcapitalist dialectic theory to analyse and  
deconstruct class.

Werther[2] holds that the works of Spelling are reminiscent of  
Rushdie. However, an abundance of theories concerning conceptualist  
situationism may be revealed.

2. Spelling and postcapitalist dialectic theory

?Society is elitist,? says Debord. In Robin?s Hoods, Spelling  
analyses the neodialectic paradigm of context; in The Heights,  
although, he affirms conceptualist situationism. Therefore, Marx uses  
the term ?capitalist deconstruction? to denote the meaninglessness  
of pretextual reality.

The subject is interpolated into a that includes culture as a  
totality. Thus, if predeconstructivist textual theory holds, we have  
to choose between postcapitalist dialectic theory and dialectic  
subcultural theory.

Derrida promotes the use of dialectic capitalism to attack class  
divisions. However, Hubbard[3] implies that the works of Spelling are  
postmodern.

Marx uses the term ?predeconstructivist textual theory? to denote  
the difference between class and sexual identity. But the absurdity,  
and subsequent stasis, of conceptualist situationism intrinsic to  
Spelling?s Melrose Place emerges again in Robin?s Hoods, although  
in a more self-fulfilling sense.

3. The neocultural paradigm of consensus and constructive narrative

In the works of Spelling, a predominant concept is the concept of  
postcapitalist reality. The subject is contextualised into a that  
includes consciousness as a reality. Thus, if the deconstructivist  
paradigm of context holds, the works of Spelling are empowering.

The main theme of the works of Spelling is not appropriation, but  
subappropriation. However, many discourses concerning a mythopoetical  
totality exist.

In Models, Inc., Spelling denies constructive narrative; in The  
Heights he affirms conceptualist situationism. Therefore, the premise  
of postcapitalist socialism states that discourse must come from  
communication, but only if Foucault?s model of predeconstructivist  
textual theory is valid.

4. Spelling and textual theory

?Society is fundamentally used in the service of colonialist  
perceptions of class,? says Marx. Derrida suggests the use of  
predeconstructivist textual theory to analyse sexual identity.  
However, the premise of subdialectic constructivist theory holds that  
the task of the artist is deconstruction.

In the works of Spelling, a predominant concept is the distinction  
between feminine and masculine. Hamburger[4] states that we have to  
choose between constructive narrative and materialist theory.  
Therefore, the characteristic theme of Dahmus?s[5] critique of  
Baudrillardist simulation is the common ground between society and  
sexual identity.

If constructive narrative holds, we have to choose between  
conceptualist situationism and neotextual discourse. However,  
Bataille uses the term ?capitalist theory? to denote the role of  
the poet as artist.

Lyotard?s model of constructive narrative implies that sexuality may  
be used to reinforce sexism, given that reality is distinct from  
sexuality. But Sontag uses the term ?predialectic socialism? to  
denote the futility, and therefore the defining characteristic, of  
capitalist culture.

The subject is interpolated into a that includes language as a  
reality. However, an abundance of dematerialisms concerning  
constructive narrative may be found.

Sartre promotes the use of neoconceptual narrative to deconstruct  
class divisions. In a sense, many materialisms concerning the role of  
the poet as artist exist.

In the OASIS [1] context, it's a hard requirement that HTTP scheme namespace
URIs resolve to namespace documents.  This rule follows the W3C Web
Architecture guidance [2], but more the point, specification developers have had
a lot of experience with namespaces, and concluded on their own that the
W3C guidance is sound.  A namespace document is a very natural resource type:
since a namespace document documents a namespace, and
documentation (as opposed to a 404) is good.  Software that blindly tries to
follow any HTTP scheme URI (just because it's possible to attempt a
dereference under DNS+HTTP) is buggy software.  It's best not to confuse
buggy software design with good Web Architecture design.

Here are a couple example NS URIs owned by OASIS; they should resolve
to namespace documents:

http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-rx/wsrm/200702
http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsbpel/2.0/plnktype

Others:

DocBook: http://docbook.org/ns/docbook
GML: http://www.opengis.net/gml
SVG: http://www.w3.org/2000/svg
WS-Transfer: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/transfer

In the more recent W3C practice, NS URIs with the /ns/ path are being used.
I think it's a good idea because it conveys clearly to a human (and to a
machine, if you care) that the URI is a namespace URI.

In defense of the LoC/MARC-XML folks, as late as the March 2003 draft 
of AWWW [1] there was no clear recommendation about namespace documents, 
and MARC21/slim was released way back in 2002. However, since current best 
practices have settled around the current AWWW recommendations it would 
be nice if the LoC/MARC-XML folks made the namespace URI resolve... anyone 
listening?

This also serves as a wake-up that we should make the OAI namespace URIs
resolve too (none of which give anything useful at present):

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Survey of Institutional Digital Repositories
	Published
Message-ID: <8C9F0FDAF8ADD97-BC8-2FAA@Webmail-mg20.sysops.aol.com>


?


Primary Research Group has published The International Survey of Institutional Digital Repositories (ISBN # 1-57440- 090-8) and would like to share some of its research results.

?

Just a few of the study?s many findings are that:

?


Forty Seven percent of repositories sampled say that the works in the repository are primarily not cataloged.


?


The average institutional digital repository spent $78,802 (US)?in start up costs.


?


Close to 41% of survey participants purchased software to develop their digital repositories. US-based institutions were much more likely than others to purchase software for this purpose. 


?


The average repository in the sample has been in existence for 2.85 years, with a range of ?just newly started? to ten years.


?


On average, a drop more than 12% of the content in the repositories came from pre-existing repositories maintained by academic departments or some other institutional unit.


?


A sixth of the libraries in the sample used Digital Commons software, and 28% of US-based repositories used this product.


?


14.81% of the institutions in the sample plan to purchase new repository software within the next two years.


?


Only 5.56% of the repositories in the sample use blogs to publicize the repository while close to 41% use a paper promotional brochure.


?


Those repositories in the sample that required less than 500 hours of labor per year had budgets of just less than $9,000 US. The largest repositories, those requiring 3,600 hours or more annually, had budgets averaging $145,444. 


?


5.21% of the overall labor required to run the digital repositories in the sample came from academic departments not connected to the library.


?


The art, architecture and music category was considered a heavy contributor by 4.88% of the repositories in the sample, and a significant contributor by 9.76%. 41.47% considered art, architecture or music to be modest contributors. Most significant and all heavy contributors from these fields were from the USA. Once again, the BA/MA granting colleges were more likely to have significant or heavy contributors in this subject area.


?


The mean number of journal articles held by the repositories in the sample was 772 with a mean of 162.


?


4.88% of the journal articles in the repositories were subject to page view limits.


?


15.56% of the repositories in the sample were funded largely through grants.


?

The study presents data from 56 institutional digital repositories from eleven countries, including the USA, Canada, Australia, Germany, South Africa, India, Turkey and other countries.? The 121-page study presents more than 300 tables of data and commentary and is based on data from higher education libraries and other institutions involved in institutional digital repository development. 

The report covers costs, budgets, software, personnel, open access policies, marketing, relations with faculty and other contributors of content, and many other issues relevant to those managing or designing an institutional digital depository. Data is broken out by geographic region, type of college or institution, and scope of the repository, defined by the number of man-hours per year needed for operation.

..and this surprised me, so I went and checked in ROAR, but it turns  
out to be a not unrealistic figure. Of the 221 repositories in the US  
recorded in ROAR, 44 (20%) are DigitalCommons (BePress). However, some  
of these are not "institutional" repositories, but "departmental" or  
"school" repositories for institutions that also have an institutional  
repository. In other words, schools are paying for services that the  
IR (in theory) already offers. The reasons behind that would be  
fascinating!

I want to emphasize these excellent points, because as a semantic web 
developer I see lots of XML processing software balk at RDF/XML data 
because it can't resolve the namespace URI's, which again is 
inappropriate behavior. XML documents don't have follow best practices 
to be valid, and graceful degradation rather than hard fail-fast 
behavior is in my view best practice software design for highly 
distributed document processing systems in which the consumer has no 
control over the producer.

In practical terms I often encounter confusion on the ground about the 
difference between an identifier and a locator, to the point that the 
scheme field of URI's has become overloaded with implicit semantics. At 
which point I chant the semantic web mantra:

Explicit semantics good
Implicit semantics bad

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Do you have instruction for ad hoc harvesters?
Message-ID: <4745785F0200003500029513@ntgwgate.loc.gov>

At the Library of Congress we quite often get requests for the records for a collection of digitized historical materials from entities outside the library or digital repository community.    Typically, these are organizations that want to integrate a collection of photographs into an internal system for a particular project.  An example would be the production team for a TV documentary assembling an internal collection of records and images relevant to the topic to use as the basis for selection for use in the production and tracking of associated workflow.  When pointed at the OAI site, they are mystified.

I am wondering whether we can create a quick how-to document tailored to this particular task that makes no assumptions about the technology at the other end.

Does anyone have or know of a brief introduction aimed at someone who only needs to know enough about OAI-PMH to get the records for an entire set given its setSpec (having to deal with resumption tokens), but may need to be told soem other things, such as:
  *  they will have to understand enough about the semantics of the metadata formats available to select the right metadata prefix 
  *  they will probably need XML tools to transform the records into something compatible with their local system
  *   etc., etc.

If you have something like this written that has been used successfully, and would be prepared to share it, we would love to see it.

Thank you.

This is perhaps a bit tangential, but might be worth considering...

I've seen some OAI repositories which serve up their content with
<?xml-stylesheet?> processing instructions referring to XSLT stylesheets
which convert the XML into nice HTML pages which provide a nice friendly
user interface. You don't know you're dealing with an OAI server at all!
These XML processing instructions are ignored by real OAI harvesters,
but they are respected by ordinary web browsers, and they could provide
users with a simple way to select metadata formats, navigate through
sets, follow resumption tokens, etc, etc.

For instance, here's one here:
http://info-uri.info/registry/OAIHandler?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

Conal,

Thanks for your suggestion about hiding the resumption token complexity from a user via an HTML front end.  Unfortunately, it's not that simple for a variety of reasons, one of which is scale.  A popular set has almost 200,000 records.   When the harvester has to use the resumption token process, that can be done without affecting performance on the applications that are on the same server and using the same data.  We don't want to create a short cut that causes problems for our regular users and harvesters, just to help a few requesters (who are already looking for records to batchload into a local database and are assumed to be savvy about data wrangling in their local environment) through steps that get them the records they want in the format they want.

    But thanks again for your suggestion.  

    Caroline Arms             caar@loc.gov

This is perhaps a bit tangential, but might be worth considering...

I've seen some OAI repositories which serve up their content with
<Xxml-stylesheet?> processing instructions referring to XSLT stylesheets
which convert the XML into nice HTML pages which provide a nice friendly
user interface. You don't know you're dealing with an OAI server at all!
These XML processing instructions are ignored by real OAI harvesters,
but they are respected by ordinary web browsers, and they could provide
users with a simple way to select metadata formats, navigate through
sets, follow resumption tokens, etc, etc.

For instance, here's one here:
http://info-uri.info/registry/OAIHandler?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

Cheers

Conal

I wrote an article for Ariadne a few years ago that aimed to
demonstrate how to easily harvest records from an OAI-PMH provider
with Perl [1]. The examples used a Perl module called
Net::OAI::Harvester which supports the 6 verbs, and adds a couple
more: listAllRecords and listAllIdentifiers which automatically handle
resumption tokens.

That being said, perhaps you could make a static repository [2]
available? You could periodically generate a static file from your
dynamic service and make the big file available as needed. Just out of
curiosity has anyone written a program that will generate a static
repository given the base URL for a data provider? It seems like a
generally useful utility that may have already been written.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Avano,
	assessment of one year management of a thematic OAI-PMH harvester
Message-ID: <474FE468.3060105@ifremer.fr>

Dear All,

In September 2006, Ifremer launched Avano ( http://www.ifremer.fr/avano/ 
), an OAI harvester for marine and aquatic sciences. Today, Avano 
provides centralised access to over 100.000 references, the majority of 
which are freely accessed as full text documents. They were harvested 
from more than 150 Open Archives.

I tried in one document ( 
http://www.ifremer.fr/docelec/doc/2007/acte-3238.pdf ) to review the 
functioning principles of this thematic harvester. This document also 
assess the main difficulties met during this first year of management.

Did you have similars experiences and/or any comments about this paper?

Kind regards,
Fred
