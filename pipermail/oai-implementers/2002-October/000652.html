OPEN ACCESS TO HIDDEN RESOURCES
2nd Open Archives Forum Workshop

The organizing committee is very pleased to announce the 2nd Open
Archives Forum Workshop, which will be held in Lisbon
on 6-7 December, 2002. Registration will open soon on the Open
Archives Forum website (<A HREF="http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/">http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/</A>).

The objective of this workshop is to bring together organizations that
work in the archival and library fields in order explore whether, and
under what conditions, the open archive approach is viable for these
organisations. It also intends to promote the establishment of new
collaborative links aimed at building interoperable infrastructures
for supporting the dissemination of both archival and library
resources. A tutorial on the implementation of the Open Archives
Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) will be held the
afternoon before the workshop for those people who are not familiar
with this protocol.

The workshop will consist of both presentations given by invited
speakers and small groups' breakout sessions where the participants
can discuss key issues, such as:
* How far OAI-PMH is applicable to the electronic records of
traditional archives, whether historical or &quot;born digital&quot;;
* To what extent OAI-PMH and Dublin Core have been tried out and
accepted in the library community;
* Can OAI-PMH enable innovative ways of cross-domain collaboration
between archival and library communities?
* How far OAI-PMH crosses over with other interoperability standards
and concepts, such as Z39.50 and web services.

One of the workshop speakers will be Carl Lagoze (NSDL) representing
the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) with an update on OAI activities.
Other speakers will include:
* George Mackenzie (National Archives of Scotland)
* Jose' Borbinha (National Library of Portugal)
* Mark Bide (Rightscom)

Who should attend.
* archivists and librarians who are considering opening their
repositories of information;
* technical, research and project managers who are interested in
providing services on interoperable open archives and libraries
* decision makers in the area of libraries and archives looking for
new strategic opportunities to promote their organizations and working
areas

About Open Archives Forum.
The Open Archives Forum provides a Europe-based focus for
dissemination of information about European activity related to open
archives and, in particular, to the Open Archives Initiative. The aim
of the Forum is to facilitate clustering of IST projects, national
initiatives and other parties interested in the open archives
approach. In order to do so, OA-Forum brings interested parties
together to build a community of interest, enable exchange of
information and establish a web-based European information source for
open archives. In addition, OA-Forum undertakes comparative reviews of
technical and organisational issues. OA-Forum is funded as an
accompanying measure within the Information Societies Technology (IST)
Programme, a theme of the European Union's Fifth Framework Programme
managed by the Information Society Directorate-General of the European
Commission. The partners of OAF are: University of Bath-UKOLN (United
Kingdom), Istituto di Elaborazione della Informazione-CNR (Italy) and
Computing Center of Humboldt University (Germany).
