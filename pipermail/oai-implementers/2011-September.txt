Subject: [OAI-implementers] same xml namespace declaration in header and
	payload
Message-ID: <fd1758c322e34f2dc5c3d714341aff69.squirrel@webmail.ifi.lmu.de>

Dear all,

the XML payload of an OAI response (GetRecord,ListRecords) can in certain
circumstances contain the same namespace declaration as the OAI header. If
the whole document (skeleton and payload) is treated as one DOM by the
provider, the additional namespace declaration in the payload is removed
(by any smart DOM library). A naive harvester, that only textwise cuts out
the payload out of the OAI response, will then encounter an invalid XML
document (with missing namespace declarations).

For instance, the OAI-PMH root element declares
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance". This is likely to
be also present in a XML document that is embedded as payload.

Considering that it is impossible to rid the world of naive harvesters,
the question is how an OAI provider should deal with this. Should it leave
two namespace declarations in the response? It is surprisingly difficult
to do this, because most DOM libraries automatically remove redundant
declarations.

how is this problem addressed out there?

thanks and best regards
Timo

Timo,

One solution would be to deliver RDF/XML as an OAI "metadata format".
Since RDF is statement-based rather than record-based, you wouldn't have
to worry about xsi:schemaLocation or its namespace.

Not to be obnoxious, but isn't this problem of the naive harvester
rather than the OAI provider?  The provider is doing the Right
Thing(TM).  If someone is using a naive (i.e. broken) harvester
shouldn't they be the one to work around the problems this causes?

I would argue that OAI-PMH is to blame here for forcing OAI wrappers on consumers who only care about the data. I think it would be healthy to have a conversation about how OAI-PMH could be improved after all these years.

Or, even, whether there are more standard standards that might/should
be used instead.
