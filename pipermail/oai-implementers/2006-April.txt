Sorry about that. I updated the distribution to use a consistent log4j
jar file. As for the missing class org/apache/xapth/XPathAPI, it appears
these classes were removed from the jre1.5 distribution, so I added new
jars to the harvester2 distribution to compensate. Grab the latest
harvester2 distribution from
http://pubserv.oclc.org/oaiharvester2/jars/dist.html and try it again.
Let me know if you have further problems.

**Metadata Tools for Digital Resource Repositories Workshop**
	Thursday, June 15, 2006, 8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m.


This is an open call to participate in the Metadata Tools for Digital
Resource Repositories Workshop
(http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/jcdl_2006_tools_workshop.html) at JCDL:  2006 in
Chapel Hill, NC, USA.


**Workshop Description**

Metadata tools are vital for DLs (digital library) and digital resource
repository growth. Sharable ontologies and metadata schemas supporting a
wide range of functions have helped initiate tool development. The DL
community needs to share developments, knowledge, and evaluation
methodologies specific to DL metadata tools. This workshop will
facilitate dialog among people interested in metadata tools including,
but not limited to users, tool developers, and companies. The workshop
seeks to improve communication in the DL/metadata tool community and
advance the state-of-the-art for tools in this environment. Specific
objectives are to:

1. Communicate challenges and solutions specific DL metadata tools and
software, including metadata creation, management, preservation,
display, and retrieval issues.

2. Exhibit a range of tools developed to aid creators, managers, and
users of information systems, specifically in their work with metadata
schemas and vocabularies.

3. Foster discussion between software developers, DL leaders, digital
collection managers and application users.


**Participation & Exhibitors Call**

Participation is open for general workshop attendance. We invite users,
researchers, tool developers and companies. We are also seeking
participants who plan to exhibit their tools in the Tools Exhibition
part of the workshop.

Exhibitors need to submit a brief abstract about the functionalities and
special features of their application to be shared with workshop
participants.Deadline for submission: May 15, 2006. Notification, May
20, 2006. Exhibitors should submit a brief abstract about the
functionalities and special features of their application to Thomas
Severiens: severiens AT mathematik.uni-osnabrueck.de, or Jane Greenberg:

i'm rewriting an OAI provider in xquery (or maybe ocaml and xquery,
we'll see, because i won't be doing the ocaml part). if you want it,

In case there are any other rubyists on the list I thought they might  
be interested in ruby-oai [1]. Predictably it allows you to:

   require 'oai'
   client = OAI::Client.new 'http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/oai/oai.cgi'

   last_check = Date.new(2004,1,1)

   for record in client.list_records :from => last_check
     puts record.metadata
   end

In the example record.metadata is actually a REXML::Element object  
that can be manipulated and written out. The other 5 verbs are  
supported as well. ruby-oai is available as a gem on rubyforge.org so  
if you use gems you just need to:

   gem install oai

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Harvesting- how to efficiently poll?
Message-ID: <20060430023941.40804.qmail@web38505.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


If the granularity of an archive is YYYY-MM-DD and there are
many records per day, how can one efficiently poll for the
newest records?  I would have expected there to be a way to
specify the last seen record and get any newer records, but
it appears the only method is to first make a request with the
date then keep requesting on any encountered resumptionTokens.
when a response is received with no resumptionToken, keep
it until it expires, then the next poll starts with the date
again.  Is this correct? That seems to generate much repeated
data in responses when polling with the last resumptionToken.
