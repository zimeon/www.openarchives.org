Subject: [OAI-implementers] Digital Cultural Content Forum meeting
Message-ID: <p04320404ba110d6ebf8b@[192.168.1.100]>

The digital Cultural Content Forum (CCF), an international gathering of
key stakeholders in the digitisation and delivery of our global cultural
assets, invites you to express interest in attending our next meeting,
an executive retreat in the north of Italy over the weekend 28-30 March
2003. It will follow the well-known EVA Florence Conference
[http://www.vasari.co.uk/eva/florence/], which may include a wider
discussion session on some of the issues being addressed by the CCF for
those who are not able to attend the weekend event.

Previous meetings have been held in London and in Washington, D.C., and
have attracted representatives from North America, Europe, Asia, New
Zealand and Australia.

This third meeting will again be by invitation only, and will be limited
to no more than 30 participants. The primary scope of discussions will
be around explorations of audience for digitised cultural content, and
this discussion will be informed by a piece of background research
recently commissioned by the CCF, and by presentations and other
material contributed by participants.

It is intended that the meeting will result in a far better
understanding of existing research into what audiences need from and
expect of our cultural institutions in the online environment, and also
that the group can agree a plan of action for progressing activity in
this increasingly topical area.

Those interested in attending are requested to submit their expression
of interest to

         ccf-info@culturalcontentforum.org

NO LATER THAN Friday 17 January 2003.

Expressions of interest should detail any work your organisation has
already undertaken in assessing the needs of online audiences, as well
as specific issues that you hope might be addressed over the weekend.
Those who are able to contribute content to the commissioned background
research, and to provide relevant input for fellow participants in
advance of the meeting are especially welcomed.

Successful applicants will be notified by the end of January, 2003, and
we currently hope to be in a position to meet the costs of accommodation
over the weekend.

We look forward to hearing from you,

David Dawson, Resource
Paul Miller, UKOLN

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Aggregator question
Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE98342A27@OA3-SERVER.oa.oclc.org>

We plan to harvest a mixture of OAI-PMH v2.0, 1.1 and possibly 1.0
repositories, aggregate the results, and provide OAI-PMH v2.0 access to the
new repository. To do this, it will be necessary to upgrade old oai_dc
metadata records to the 2.0 schemaLocation
(http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd).

According to section 2 of the  "Guidelines for Aggregators, Caches and
Proxies" (http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-aggregator.htm)
"Agents which re-export harvested records should do so with different
identifiers unless the metadata is unaltered...." The question is, then,
does the change to a new schemaLocation constitute an alteration of the
metadata?

While I'm at it, I'm tempted to normalize the presence of xml namespace
prefixes. For example, some repositories use an implied namespace prefix,
some use oai_dc:dc, some use oaidc:dc, etc. Would this kind of change
constitute an alteration of the metadata?

Thanks.

Jeff

Celestial already does this:
http://celestial.eprints.org/

Although perhaps not very well ... (but unless you have a pressing need to
implement this in java, perhaps time would be better spent improving my
existing code, if needed?)

The oai-perl libraries I wrote convert OAI 1.x oai_dc records into OAI 2.0
oai_dc records by changing the schema namespace/location etc, and changing
the XML tag names, e.g.:
creator => oai_dc:creator

A providence record is added to the about section by Celestial that provides
the date this conversion occurred (broken due to schema URLs changing
location ... :-( ).

The source OAI identifier is maintained. The reason being, from my point of
view, whether OAI 1.0, 1.1, or 2.0 is used makes no difference to the actual
data provided by the oai-perl libraries (transparently and silently
converts).

Note also Celestial harvests the Set structure of OAI 1.x repositories and
exposes these through the OAI 2.0 headers.

I currently use Celestial as a buffer between Citebase and the source
repositories - so if something screws up in Citebase it doesn't overload
arXiv.org etc.

All the best,
Tim.

Hi

First, apologies for duplication.

Second, I wanted to update people on the status of the my.OAI search web
site (http://www.myoai.com), it still up and running and will be for the
foreseeable future. I have added three data sources which looks interesting,
namely Project Euclid, MIT Theses and the University of Michigan Library.

I am trying to avoid using a database to determine if our resumptionToken
has expired, and I am finding it impossible. A resumption Token may appear
perfectly valid, but because portion our data may have been updated, it
really is not valid.  It is very difficult to determine when the data is
updated, unless this information where kept in a database.  Fortunately the
updates are infrequent, but none the less this situation can occur.  Can any
of you share your thoughts on this?

I'm not sure I fully understand what you mean when you say "avoid using a
database"...  are you unable to store any info at your repository?  could
you not store the date of the latest update (t)?

for example, if your expanded your rT to include the time of the latest
update (tL) from when the first "List" verb was recvd, you could check
each time you recv the rT to see if t > tL, and if so, you could
invalidate the rT.

if for some reason you can't locally store t, you could compute each time
by doing a ListIdentifiers verb to yourself using tL as the value for the
"from" argument. if you get "noRecordsMatch", then your rT is still valid,
otherwise it is invalid.  

I hope I've understood your question...

Michael

Subject: [OAI-implementers] oai_dc: Multiple identifiers and formats within a single record?
Message-ID: <26062.1040169256@www14.gmx.net>

Hi everybody.

I am implementing an OAI repository which will actually convert existing
data in rdf format to oai_dc.

Most of the entries in the database have amongst other data:
...
File-URL: http://server/2001-004a.htm
File-Format: text/html
File-Function: Abstract
File-URL: http://server/2001-004.htm
File-Format: text/html
File-Function: Full text
File-URL: http://server/2001-004.pdf
File-Format: application/pdf
File-Function: Full text
...

If I translate this directly to:
...
<dc:format>text/html</dc:format>
<dc:format>text/html</dc:format>
<dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format>
<dc:identifier>http://server/2001-004a.htm</dc:identifier>
<dc:identifier>http://server/2001-004.htm</dc:identifier>
<dc:identifier>http://server/2001-004.pdf</dc:identifier>
...

Would it be correct?
if this is acceptable (in oai_dc each element has minoccur=0 and
maxoccur=inf)
how can one tell what format links to what identifiers?

Or I have to invent several records with same content but the identifier?

Or create an HTML file representing the rdf data and use its URL as an
identifier?

Any opinion/help very much appreciated as I have to have this running by
Xmas.

Cheers,
Marin

Hi Marin,

If possible, you should export both your RDF and oai_dc through your OAI
interface - any XML format with a schema can be exported.

Dublin Core AFAIK is not ordered, therefore you can't infer from:

<format>a</format>
<format>b</format>
<identifier>c</identifier>
<identifier>d</identifier>

That a is the format of c, and b the format of d.

Probably the best solution would be to create a "jump-off" page with links
to the abstract, and full-text formats. And it is this page that you include
in your oai_dc identifier.

Alternatives might be to just include the URLs in identifier tags (any
harvester can get the file type by performing an HTTP query), but this
wouldn't include the "Full Text"/"Abstract" descriptions.

Or you could do some kind of string encoding (e.g. eprints.org 2.0):
<format>pdf http://xxx/yyy</format>
Then a service-provider can do application-specific un-encoding.

All the best,
Tim.

Tim, François, Donna,

Thanks for all your responses.

Obviously I will stick to the model of creating html pages for
each record that include all the URLs.

At a second stage I will look for a XML RDF schema, but oai_dc
has to be done first. I like standards :-)

NSDL implementation is wrong or I'm not using the resumptionToken verb 
properly.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

resumptionToken is no a verb, it is an exclusive argument for 
ListIdentifiers or ListRecords. Your request should look something 
like:

GET baseURL?verb=ListRecords&resumptionToken=APPROPRIATELY_ENCODED_RT_HERE

where APPROPRIATELY_ENCODED_RT_HERE is the URL-encoded resumptionToken.

If an OAI record is for a multi-page document (several
different URLs), is it accepted practice to simply use
the link to the first page, for the Dublin Core identifier
field?
   I'm thinking that this would make it difficult to
harvest content, for those so inclined.
   I'd appreciate any thoughts you have on the matter.

   Thanks!

I'd be tempted to repeat dc:identifier to provide a list of the URLs for
each page/part.

But it's worth noting that the simple oai_dc format isn't expressive
enough to differentiate between 'here are several URLs, you need them all'
and 'here are several URLs, they are alternatives'.

I tend to disagree... on two counts.  1) this makes it
difficult/impossible for harvesters to gather full content.  2) it is
questionable whether it is good practice to describe resource A (the
full-text or whatever) but provide a URL for resource B (the jump-off
page).

My view is that the jump-off page is 'related' to the full-text, therefore
the URL for the jump-off page belongs in dc:relation (rather than in
dc:identifier).

This seems to be a better approach to me.

My preferred approach (as suggested in the original message) would simply
be to make available separate oai_dc records for each format of the full
text.  The downside is that the multiple records would carry significant
duplication (title, description, subvject, etc.), but each could carry the
correct format/identifier pair.

> Or you could do some kind of string encoding (e.g. eprints.org 2.0):
> <format>pdf http://xxx/yyy</format>

This usage does *not* fall within the semantics of dc:format.  I would
therefore discourage it.

The bottom line is that we need to stick within the limitations of simple
DC when using the oai_dc format - which means that there will be some
things we cannot convey because the format is too simple!  If we want to
provide richer metadata, then we have to use a richer metadata syntax -
whether that's RDF or METS or whatever.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212191113000.22558-100000@ice.cs.cornell.edu>

oai_dc schema
-------------

A revised version of the simpledc schema was released on 
2002-12-12 and fixes earlier validation problems
<http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/simpledc20021212.xsd>. 
We have updated the oai_dc schema to import the new simpledc
schema, see <http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd>. 
The previous version is available at 
<http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.2002-06-14.xsd>.

The new oai_dc schema also corrects the unnecessary double 
specification of minOccurs and maxOccurs for the individual 
elements, i.e.

<complexType name="oai_dcType">
  <choice minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
    <element ref="dc:title" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
    ...
 
has become

<complexType name="oai_dcType">
  <choice minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
    <element ref="dc:title"/>
    ...

These fixes will not require any changes to oai_dc metadata but 
they will avoid validation errors.


OAI-PMH specification
---------------------

The oai_dc fixes noted above have been incorporated in the OAI-PMH
specification.

The examples in sections 2.5 and 4.5 which use the <provenance>
container have been corrected and now validate against the
provenance schema. 

The corrected protocol document replaces the previous version at
<http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm>.
The previous version is available at
<http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.2002-09-13.htm>.

Message-ID: <15631.1040944171@www45.gmx.net>

Hi all,

first of all, best wishes for the New Year!

Can anybody tell me how to handle special characters like &ouml;
in the XML output? I thought Perl and the XML::Writer are doing
the conversion automatically, but for now I am getting the error:

An invalid XML character (Unicode: 0x1b2ea5) was found in the element
content of the document.

respectively in IE:

An Invalid character was found in text content. Line 15, Position 28 
 
     <dc:creator>Tanja A. B?l</dc:creator>
---------------------------^


The question mark is supposed to be the german o with the two dots...

If I encode those characters as HTML entities than they are not
interpreted correctly by the reading program because the ampersands
are escaped with &amp;.

For now I am using this aproach. It is not quite correct but at least
is readable without errors...

Any help very appreciated,
Marin

The appropriate UTF-8 respresentation of the character should be used.

I have no idea how you might get character 0x1b2ea5 -- this is not a 
valid Unicode character. &ouml; should be 0xf6

(from: http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt)
00F6;LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS

My guess is that you are not correctly producing UTF-8 from whatever
source documents you have (which like use some other character encoding).

This is my first experience with the writer, but it seems to do its
work very well...

Neither me. And you are right, it's 0xf6.

Correct. I was to naive, thinking that perl or the xml::writer will do
the conversion for me... I am now using the Unicode::String module
and it seems to work as expected...
