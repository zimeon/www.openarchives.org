<PRE>3 Jobs Open for Immediate Start, for Digital Library Techies:  DC Metro
-------------------------------------------------------

I, (Terry Harrison) joined this list a few years ago while getting my Master&#146;s in CS at ODU.  I am now working for CACI (who just acquired my former company ISS), who is managing a 5 year contract to help manage digital preservation efforts with a large government agency in the DC area.

We currently have tasking that requires us to expand our development team and I thought this group would be a great place to connect with some great candidates.  I do apologize in advance if a job posting is not appropriate, but it is done in the desire to promote Digital Library development efforts, so it is my hope that I am doing this in the right spirit. 

In the coming year we are planning to prototype a data submission pipeline between a handful of publishers and value-added content providers and the government agency. This is an area where recent hands-on experience, rather than academic qualifications or certifications would count a lot.  

Although experience with big-agency and big-project process is desired... we are building a small, agile, prototyping team, and members will be wearing many hats. This is a very exciting opportunity for high-octane techies to join a team that will prototype systems, services, and standards that have the potential to influence and shape the way all the media and publishing industries connect and communicate with cultural heritage institutions such as libraries, archives and museums.


We are looking to add the following to our team, which will be based offsite, in the Washington DC Metro area.  Some telecommuting may be possible.

1    Software engineer, lead
1    Software QA specialist
1    Systems Analyst

I will include a description of the qualifications we are looking for below.  Interested parties should send their resume and cover letter to:
