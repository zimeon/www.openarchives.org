       METADATA TOOLS for DIGITAL RESOURCE REPOSITORIES WORKSHOP
                              AT JCDL 2006


This is an open call to participate in the Metadata Tools for Digital
Resource Repositories Workshop on June 15, 2006 at JCDL:  2006 (Joint
Conference on Digital Libraries:  <A HREF="http://www.jcdl2006.org/">http://www.jcdl2006.org/</A>), in
Chapel Hill, NC, USA.

Metadata tools are vital for DLs and digital resource repository growth.
Sharable ontologies and metadata schemas supporting a wide range of
functions have helped initiate tool development. Project demands and
deadlines have made it difficult for tool developers, from different
digital initiatives, to share their progress.  Opportunity is also limited
for tool users to learn about applications and interact with developers,
distributors, and other consumers of metadata tools.  A venue is needed
for sharing developments, knowledge, and evaluation methodologies specific
to DL metadata tools.

This one day workshop will facilitate dialog among people interested in
metadata tools including, but not limited to, tool developers, companies,
and users.  The workshop has three components:

    1.  Presentations of application design challenges and solutions.

    2.  A tools exhibition.

    3.  A discussion on application evaluation and improving
        communication within the metadata tool community.

Workshop overview, objectives, and a tentative schedule can be found at:
<A HREF="http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/JCDL_Tools_WS_1.pdf">http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/JCDL_Tools_WS_1.pdf</A>

The workshop is an official DCMI Tools Working Group
( <A HREF="http://dublincore.org/groups/tools/">http://dublincore.org/groups/tools/</A> ) event.

The call is open for general workshop attendance. We are also seeking
participants who plan to exhibit their tools in Part 2, Tools Exhibition.

We request that all participants partake in the entire one-day workshop,
including Part 3, Breakout Groups and Discussion.
