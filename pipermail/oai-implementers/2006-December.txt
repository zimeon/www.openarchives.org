Hi, 

 

I have a question concerning sets - metadataPrefix relationship.

Is it permitted by the protocol to "attach" metadataPrefix to set?

 

For example, is the following situation is valid:

I define two sets  A and B. All the records from my repository belong to
both sets.

Set A "contains" records in marcxml. Set B "contains" records in oai_dc.

ListSets response contains 2 sets: A and B

ListMetadataFormats reponse contains 2 formats: marxml and oai_dc.

ListRecords request with set=A, metadataPrefix=marcxml - results in list
of records

ListRecords request with set=A, metadataPrefix=oai_dc - results in error
cannotDissemenateFormat

ListRecords request with set=B, metadataPrefix=marcxml - results in
error cannotDissemenateFormat

ListRecords request with set=B, metadataPrefix=oai_dc - results in list
of record

GetRecord request for any record in my repository both with
metadataPrefix=marcxml and with

metadataPrefix=oai_dc results in the record in corresponding format.

 

Sorry if I repeat the question which has been risen several months ago.
I see that there was discussion

on the same matter, but unfortunately I did not find answer on my
question.

 

Thanks,

Irina Dijour

My understanding is that you can have one set that delivers only oai_dc 
records, and another that delivers only marcxml records; but in the 
cases you give the appropriate error response would be noRecordsMatch 
rather than cannotDisseminateFormat.

Imagine a case where a set contained only one record that could be 
returned as marcxml.  If your date range included that record, then 
you'd return the record; if not, you'd return noRecordsMatch.  The same 
logic applies if there are no records in the set that can be returned as 
marcxml.

My interpretation of the spec is that "cannotDisseminateFormat" would be
illegal, since the "mandatory" status of oai_dc means that you MUST be
able to disseminate oai_dc metadata for every item.

I also think it would be wrong to return "noRecordsMatch", because in
fact the item does exist (since it can be disseminated in marcxml). IMHO
the correct approach is to return some oai_dc. NB the oai_dc schema has
no mandatory child elements inside the "dc" element, though for the sake
of form it would probably not be hard to generate a dc:title and a
dc:identifier from the marcxml store.

Irina,

If I understand the description of your situation correctly, you can do what you want with only one set.   

Currently every record in the OAI repository for records for digitized historical materials at LC [See http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/oamh/index.html ] is available in several metadata formats.   This is also true for every set defined.  The set is thus a group of underlying records, independent of the format in which the records are harvestable.

This is not the only way to implement sets, but it may be convenient for your situation as it was for mine.  

The draft Best Practices for Data Providers on sets [http://oai-best.comm.nsdl.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SetPractices]
encourage data providers to use the SetDescription feature to indicate the formats in which records for a set can be harvested. If you have not seen that wiki page, there  may be other information that would be helpful.

Hi,

The definition of set from the specification is:

"A set is an optional construct for grouping _items_ for the purpose of 
selective harvesting."

I've deliberately emphasized the word _item_ which also has a specific 
meaning in the protocol:

"An item is a constituent of a repository from which metadata about a 
resource can be disseminated."

This is to be differentiated from records:

"A record is metadata expressed in a single format. A record is returned 
in an XML-encoded byte stream in response to an OAI-PMH request for 
metadata from an item."

In other words a set is a grouping of items and not a grouping of 
records (items represented in a specific metadata format).

The protocol also requires every item to have a corresponding oai_dc 
record.

This implies to me that a request like:

   ?verb=ListRecords&set=A&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

must always return records for all the items belonging to that set, 
assuming that set A is not empty.  For example, if set A has 10 items 
then this request must always return all 10 records.

A request for some other metadata format could return all the same items 
in the requested format, no items, or a subset of the items that belong 
to that set, depending on whether or which of those items are available 
in the other format, for example:

   ?verb=ListRecords&set=A&metadataPrefix=marcxml

might return 10 records assuming that all the records have mappings to 
marcxml.  It might just return 5 records because only half of the items 
in set A have a mapping to marcxml, and the other half do not.  It might 
also return no records with an error of noRecordsMatch or 
cannotDisseminateFormat.  If there are items in the repository that can 
be disseminated as marcxml, just not for this set, you should use 
noRecordsMatch.  However, if the repository does not support marcxml at 
all for any of its items, then use cannotDisseminateFormat.

Hope this helps,
	Tom

Hi, 

Thank you all for the answers. I am agree with Caroline that the 
best situation is when all the items can be returned in all the
supported formats, not depending on the sets definition.
Unfortunately I have some constraints in my repository.

My understanding was that each item must have corresponding oai_dc
record.
I wanted to expose all these oai_dc records through special set of
oai_dc
records.
Now it's clear to me that any item from any set must be available in
oai_dc.
I will think how to redesign my sets structure.

Thanks a lot!
Irina

e-Libro | TRES NUEVOS PROGRAMAS:

e-Librorevistas  + e-Librotesis + IaP

Impresi?n a pedido



Tesis



e-Librotesis es un programa elaborado en cooperaci?n con las universidades 
de Am?rica Latina, Espa?a y Portugal actualmente conectadas a la plataforma 
e-Libro tecnolog?a eBrary. Se pretende que sea el recept?culo de ese c?mulo 
de trabajos de investigaci?n que permanecen est?ticos en los anaqueles de 
las bibliotecas, y, adem?s, la soluci?n para los autores que enfrentan 
serias dificultades para editar, publicar e imprimir su trabajo de tesis.

Autores y universidades recibir?n trimestralmente el pago de derechos, y 
tendr?n asegurada, como cualquier libro de las colecciones de e-Libro, la 
protecci?n contra la reproducci?n ilegal mediante la aplicaci?n del DRM 
(Digital Right Managment).



Las primeras 1600 tesis ya se pueden ver en www.e-libro.com.



IaP (?impresi?n a pedido?)



Tanto los autores como las universidades tendr?n a su disposici?n, al margen 
de las novedosas herramientas de aprendizaje InfoTools? y las colecciones de 
e-Libro?, a las que tendr?n acceso, la posibilidad de imprimir ejemplares 
gracias a nuestro novedoso sistema IaP ?impreso a pedido?, cuyo software de 
?ltima generaci?n permite hacer tirajes m?nimos (20 ejemplares, por ejemplo) 
a un precio similar al de una impresi?n tradicional en offset, la que, a 
diferencia de aqu?lla, exige hacer un elevado desembolso. Para tal efecto, 
los libros de texto, los materiales de ayuda a la ense?anza y las tesis se 
publicar?n tambi?n en www.e-libro.net, nuestro sitio hermano.



Solicite informaci?n adicional a: isabel@e-libro.net

la empresa mas importante en USA de ventas a bibliotecas publicas de libros 
en IaP ha hecho una alianza estrat?gica con e-Libro. Ahora todos los 
editores solo tienen que mandar sus archivos de sus libros a 
contenidos@e-libro.net y nosotros los venderemos en las 122000 bibliotecas 
p?blicas que hay en Estados Unidos.

            Ahora los libros no se agotan m?s, tampoco hace falta bodega 
para los libros nuevos, se imprime lo que se vende y cuando se vende y se 
env?a a la biblioteca.



Revistas Cient?ficas



El programa e-Librorevistas aglutinar? selectas revistas acad?micas, para 
ponerlas al alcance de los investigadores y los estudiantes usuarios de la 
plataforma e-Libroebrary. Ser?, asimismo, una excelente oportunidad para las 
publicaciones peri?dicas con problemas de distribuci?n o peque?os tirajes.

Para llevar adelante este ambicioso programa, e-Libro ha creado el Instituto 
Superior de Investigaci?n (ISI), donde se seleccionar?n las mejores revistas 
acad?micas de Am?rica Latina, El Caribe, Espa?a y Portugal.

El Proyecto e-Libro para la publicaci?n electr?nica cooperativa en Internet 
responde a las necesidades de la comunicaci?n cient?fica en los pa?ses en 
desarrollo, y proporciona una soluci?n eficiente para asegurar la 
visibilidad y el acceso universal a la literatura en cuesti?n y superar el 
fen?meno conocido como ciencia perdida.

Este proyecto es el producto de la colaboraci?n de instituciones 
internacionales relacionadas con la comunicaci?n cient?fica y de editores 
especializados en el tema.

Modelo e-Libro?



El Modelo e-Libro? supone la concatenaci?n de los siguientes elementos:

- La publicaci?n electr?nica de ediciones completas de revistas cient?ficas, 
que representa, adem?s de la preservaci?n de las mismas, la organizaci?n de 
bases de datos bibliogr?ficas, la recuperaci?n de textos por su contenido 
(enriquecidos din?micamente con enlaces de hipertexto a bases de datos 
internacionales, usando las InfoTools? o herramientas de aprendizaje) y la 
producci?n de indicadores estad?sticos de uso e impacto de la literatura 
cient?fica.

- Criterios de evaluaci?n basados en los est?ndares internacionales de 
comunicaci?n cient?fica.

- Fomento y desarrollo de alianzas entre los actores internacionales de la 
comunicaci?n cient?fica ?autores, editores, instituciones cient?ficas y 
tecnol?gicas, agencias de apoyo, universidades, bibliotecas, centros de 
informaci?n cient?fica y tecnol?gica, etc. ?, con el objetivo de diseminar 
el conocimiento. El ?xito en el desarrollo de la plataforma e-Libro de 
revistas cient?ficas de Am?rica Latina, El Caribe, Espa?a y Portugal en los 
pr?ximos a?os contribuir? a que la informaci?n cient?fica y tecnol?gica 
generada localmente quede r?pidamente disponible, lo que incidir? en el 
aumento de su uso y beneficio en el proceso de toma de decisiones en los 
diferentes niveles involucrados.

- La poderosa plataforma e-Librotecnolog?a ebrary, su potente motor de 
b?squeda y las InfoTools?, el software con sofisticadas herramientas de 
aprendizaje l?deres en su tipo, adem?s de otros novedosos servicios.

- El sistema IaP (?Impreso a Pedido? o Book on Demand), que permite imprimir 
un m?nimo de 12 ejemplares de una revista, un journal o un libro que se 
encuentren agotados y por razones de mercado no convenga reimprimir por los 
medios tradicionales.

- Uso de MARC21, lo que permite encontrar el texto desde cualquier 
biblioteca acad?mica.



Criterios de evaluaci?n



Si bien el Modelo e-LibroTM tiene definidos desde un principio los criterios 
de evaluaci?n para la admisi?n y permanencia de t?tulos en las colecciones 
nacionales y/o regionales, en la medida en que el mismo se extienda a otros 
pa?ses, se espera un enriquecimiento tal que conlleve a la generalizaci?n 
progresiva con vistas al establecimiento de criterios ?nicos.

La evaluaci?n emanar? de dos instancias principales: el Instituto Superior 
de Investigaciones (ISI) y la recomendaci?n que hace la universidad.

El ISI formar? un Consejo Editorial de car?cter p?blico; es decir que estar? 
integrado por especialistas reconocidos, de origen nacional e internacional. 
Se invitar? a participar en ?l a prestigiosos centros de investigaci?n, como 
la UNESCO, las universidades que ya son usuarias de e-Libro.

El Comit? Consultivo estar? formado por representantes de la comunidad 
acad?mica. Tiene por objetivo, basado en la aplicaci?n de los criterios 
e-Libro, proponer:

- El enriquecimiento de los criterios de selecci?n.

- El perfeccionamiento del software InfoTools.



Los criterios propiamente dichos son b?sicamente los siguientes:

- Revistas incluidas en ?ndices internacionales. Se aceptar?n 
autom?ticamente aquellas publicaciones nacionales indizadas por 
instituciones reconocidas, ministerios, universidades y centros de 
investigaci?n.

- Revistas no incluidas en ?ndices internacionales, para ser consideradas 
por el Consejo Editorial. Cuando un t?tulo no est? autom?ticamente 
habilitado para su admisi?n en la colecci?n e-Libro, el mismo deber? ser 
evaluado por el Consejo Editorial.

- Alcance de las colecciones. Como principio general, dentro de la colecci?n 
e-Libro cabr?n las revistas cient?ficas que publican predominantemente 
art?culos resultantes de investigaciones cient?ficas originales y otras 
contribuciones de la misma ?ndole, que sean significativas para el ?rea 
espec?fica de la publicaci?n. El proceso de revisi?n y aprobaci?n de las 
contribuciones deber? ser realizado por especialistas.

Los objetivos de e-Libro? son:

?Permitir a las bibliotecas incrementar sus colecciones de manera rentable y 
eficiente, ahorrando gastos, espacio de almacenamiento y tiempo de trabajo. 
Esta base de datos se integra al cat?logo propio de la biblioteca.

?Ofrecer a los usuarios una documentaci?n cuantiosa, variada, actualizada y 
siempre disponible, a la que pueden acceder a trav?s de un poderoso motor de 
b?squeda. Asimismo tienen la posibilidad de subrayar, hacer anotaciones, 
descargar a su ordenador o imprimir todo o parte de un documento.

?Garantizar a los autores el escrupuloso respeto de sus derechos. Hoy 
E-libro es la ?nica plataforma con contenidos que tiene un software para 
liquidar los derechos de autor.

Una vez que una biblioteca suscribe un convenio con e-libro?, adem?s de que 
sus usuarios podr?n explorar la base de datos y leer los documentos, tendr?n 
a su disposici?n una cuenta personal que les permitir? configurar su 
biblioteca personal (anotaciones, libros consultados, etc.) y gestionar su 
monedero electr?nico para descargar a su ordenador o imprimir todo o parte 
de un documento.

Todos estos documentos podr?n adquirirse en m?ltiples formatos.



Las bibliotecas universitarias pueden hacer dos tipos de convenio con 
e-libro?:

1. Entregar sus contenidos y cobrar 30% por derechos de autor.

2. Pagar un derecho por instalar la plataforma ebrary.



e-libro? es un sistema fiable que integra esta base de datos a los cat?logos 
existentes y dem?s recursos digitales utilizados por la biblioteca, 
conformando una plataforma ?nica de b?squeda de informaci?n. Para ello 
cuenta con un poderoso software de b?squeda, InfoTools?, que permite a los 
usuarios tanto encontrar la informaci?n m?s completa y pertinente como 
utilizarla interactuando con el texto de los documentos (notas, se?aladores, 
etc.). Con ello las bibliotecas pueden a su vez crear enlaces sobre los 
temas de su elecci?n, incluir definiciones, informaci?n biogr?fica, mapas, 
traducciones y otros recursos digitales propios. Los usuarios podr?n acceder 
instant?nea y directamente a estos recursos cuando seleccionen palabras o 
frases, sin necesidad de cambiar de programa.

> method, and case studies
> A database tool and associated VB modules
> Stargate Tools Part 3: Issues for developing the use of OAI-based services

> We recommend to the wider community that the use of static repositories

> One of the issues that arose in the project was the apparent lack of a

> JISC have funded a brief extension to STARGATE to provide some further

Hello,
 
If this question has already been asked (and answered): sorry for the inconvenience.
 
Q: I would like to use the ListIdentifiers function with more than one metadata format. The way I understand OAI, I have to do multiple requests to get results for more than one metadata format, e.g.:
 
1st request: http://...../handleRequest.xml?verb=ListIdentifiers&metadataPrefix="oai_dc"
2nd request: http://...../handleRequest.xml?verb=ListIdentifiers&metadataPrefix="oai_czp"
 
I already found an issue that covers this question [1]. It seems that the issue is still open, but it is a 2001 issue...!
 
Could somebody tell me if this issue is resolved in OAI version 2.0? 
 
To make it more clear, I would like to do one of the following requests:
 
http://...../handleRequest.xml?verb=ListIdentifiers&metadataPrefix="oai_dc&metadataPrefix="oai_czp"
OR
http://...../handleRequest.xml?verb=ListIdentifiers&metadataPrefix="oai_dc,oai_czp"
 
Thank you in advance,
 
Henk Enting

Hi Henk,

The resolution of the issue you mention in [1] was not to provide a 
facility for requesting multiple or 'best' metadata formats. The main 
reasons, if I recall correctly, were the difficulty in defining 'best' and 
in concerns about increased response size. Also the XML structure of the 
response would have to be changed to permit multiple metadata records each 
with about blocks. It wasn't considered to be a worthwhile optimization.

The solution if to make the two requests. Same amount of data transferred 
so no real harm.

Cheers,
Simeon

Subject: [OAI-implementers] confusion about the repository structure  
Message-ID: <20061222180837.5155.qmail@web31115.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I am really very new to the OAI/PMH and I am doing a
research where I have to come up with general
solutions which are out the scope of my research!!!
Therefore, I beg your pardon if I ask a very basic or
silly questions.

I've done some initial readings but the thing which is
I am (at this stage) confused about is how the
structure of the data providers' metadata repositories
should be. 

should the service providers produce their metadata
using the normal Dublin core (and then it would be
automatically changed by OAI/PMH into the structure
below when the metadata is harvested) or they still
should use Dublin core but they have to follow this
structure when creating the metadata files:

**************************************
header (mandatory)
 ?  identifier (mandatory: 1 only)
 ?  datestamp (mandatory: 1 only)
 ?  setSpec elements (optional: 0, 1 or more)
 ?  status attribute for deleted item

metadata (mandatory): where DC should  be used or
other metadata standareds 
 ?  
about (optional)
 ?    rights statements
 ?    provenance statements
***************************************
Again sorry for asking a very basic question.

Any help is really appreciated.

Fadi
