Hi - Some of our ArchivalWare customers are upset that Google is pulling the plug on OAI-PMH in Sitemaps.  Does anyone have any more knowledge about this issue?

Retiring support for OAI-PMH in Sitemaps 
Wednesday, April 23, 2008 at 10:20 AM By John Mueller, Webmaster Trends Analyst, Google Z?rich

When we originally launched Sitemaps, we included support for the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting ( http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html ) (OAI-PMH) 2.0 protocol, an interoperability framework based on metadata harvesting. In the meantime, however, we've found that the information we gain from our support of OAI-PMH is disproportional to the amount of resources required to support it. Fewer than 200 sites are using OAI-PMH for Google Sitemaps at the moment. 

In order to move forward with even better coverage of your websites, we have decided to support only the standard XML Sitemap format by May 2008. We are in the process of notifying sites using OAI-PMH to alert them of the change. 

If you have been using OAI-PMH as a Google Sitemap feed, we would love to see you adopt the industry standard XML Sitemap ( http://www.sitemaps.org/ ) format. This format is supported by all of the major search engines and helps to make sure that everyone is able to find your new and updated content as soon as you make it available. 

If you have any questions regarding the move to XML Sitemap files, feel free to post in our Google discussion group for Sitemaps ( http://groups.google.com/group/Google_Webmaster_Help-Sitemap/topics

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Making software available on OAI Tools web site
Message-ID: <0K0D000RHRI3KK50@messaging2.anu.edu.au>

Hi,

We are finishing up a software development project some time in June, 
part of which involves the development of an oai-pmh harvester. The 
harvester makes use of the OAIHarvester2 verb classes but includes a 
back-end database and access to various services for managing multiple 
harvests with an ability to plugin different harvesting classes (for 
targetted pre/post processing of requests before forwarding OAI 
responses to other external applications). I'd like to make the software 
available on the OAI Tools website once completed, so was just wondering 
what the process is for making this happen. (While we're currently in 
testing, the software and docs probably won't be ready until June.)

Thanks.

Scott.

    Hi Simeon.  Is there something else that
    needs to be done to have a software package
    listed?  I've sent the info for our CWIS
    software package to the openarchives.org
    address (and earlier to you and to Carl),
    but it still isn't up there, which is a bit
    frustrating since CWIS was one of the first
    turnkey software packages to support OAI-PMH,
    way back in 2001.

    Ed
