Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI-ORE releases "Compound Information Objects:
	An OAI-ORE Perspective"
Message-ID: <46645EE9.4050703@lanl.gov>

hi,

I am happy to inform you that the document "Compound Information 
Objects: An OAI-ORE Perspective" is now available at 
<http://www.openarchives.org/ore/documents/CompoundObjects-200705.html>.

This document introduces a new perspective to look at compound 
information objects within the web environment, and details the issues 
that require resolution in order for OAI-ORE to be able to build an 
interoperability layer based on that perspective. This document formed 
the basis for last week's discussions of the ORE Technical Committee.

Feedback is welcome at ore@openarchives.org.

Greetings

Herbert Van de Sompel

Message-ID: <D82832DC4EE55E42A9E16ECAA65F6F7E04CF9935@ace.drexel.edu>

In certain research-collaboration initiatives on campus, faculty have
requested the capability to search our DSpace repository for only those
items that have undergone peer review.  We would therefore like to
identify peer-reviewed items in the Dublin Core fields in a way that
would play well with OAI.  Details of any consortial agreements or
individual attempts to address this issue would be appreciated.  I've
looked around on various lists and come up empty-handed.

My first thought was to include "peer-reviewed" in a "type" element or
refinement thereof.  

Another option, possibly less radical than the first, is to handle it
without altering the Dublin Core fields by checking the "publisher"
field of each search result against a white list of publishers of
peer-reviewed articles. 

Thanks for any advice.

And a web search for "dc.description.peerreviewed" returns
http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/39191?mode=full.  The more
I think about it, the more it seems the information should be stored
with the item.  After all, once an item is published in a peer-reviewed
journal, it will always be considered a peer-reviewed item.  Seems silly
that the presentation of an item's peer-reviewed status could depend on
a changing list of publishers.

Also, if we could standardize the Dublin Core on this at some point,
that would enable searches for peer-reviewed items across repositories.

We've done something similar with our IR (http://ideals.uiuc.edu) - 
we have an optional description.peerReview field and the values are 
either "is peer reviewed" or "is not peer reviewed". Of course, this 
comes across in oai_dc just as dc:description "is peer reviewed".

What about OAI sets? I guess that a set-based solution is the most  
flexible and powerful, i.e. if there are many records of a peer- 
reviewed item you must change all the records with the peer review  
flag instead of just adding the records to the set ;)

Yes, but that relies on the harvesters actually making some meaning 
of that set (i.e. aggregating those sets together and labelling them 
as peer reviewed). Since the item level metadata doesn't necessarily 
inherit any information from the set except the setSpec, you still 
need some kind of information in the metadata so that when it's 
pulled out of its native context or out of that set, a user can still 
see that it's peer reviewed.

I agree with Sarah. If being peer-reviewed or not is a property of the 
item then it would be best to put that information in the metadata record. 
Using sets as a way to _communication_this_information_ is a misuse of 
sets.

(That doesn't mean that one might not also want to have a set for peer 
reviewed only articles in order to support selective harvesting based on 
that criterion. Support for selective harvesting is the purpose of sets.)

Cheers,
Simeon

Gabriel ,

I think that "peer-reviewed" would best be an element in an appropriate type
list. For the eprints AP there is already a somewhat elaborated list, the
"Eprints Type Vocabulary Encoding Scheme":
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Eprints_Type_Vocabulary_En
coding_Scheme

Alas, the distinction between reviewed and not reviewed papers is not as
clear as I wish:

Journal Article
	An article or paper published in a journal.

Submitted Journal Article
	The author's original manuscript as submitted to and/or accepted by
a journal.
	(prior to or after peer review)

Working or Discussion Paper
	A working or discussion paper circulated publicly or among a group
of peers. 

I would argue that the distinction is of sufficient importance for scholarly
works that it should be expressed somehow in this list, although it seems
that all three forms of articles come in reviewed and non-reviewed flavours.
For my purposes, I probably would choose something like "preprint" for any
kind of article or working paper prior to review, and "article" for any such
item after the appropriate selection process in the given subject area
(which may or may not require peer review).

Best regards,
Thomas

My personal understanding of this mailing list is, as stated in the  
about of the list, "to be focused on discussing the implementation of  
the Open Archives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting". That's the  
reason why I have proposed to use sets.

I agree that being peer-reviewed or not is a property of the item but  
speculating on the metadata record fields is not part of the OAI- 
PMH ... I guess ;)

Cheers,

Leo

In the ePrints AP information about peer-reviewed status is carried in the eprint:status property (http://purl.org/eprint/terms/status) using the Eprints Status Vocabulary

http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Eprints_Status_Vocabulary_Encoding_Scheme

Status and Type are intentionally separated.

I see, and this makes sense as this property is essentially independent of
the type.
(Sorry I missed that.)
But this brings us back to the initial question: How to encode this in DC
simple for the OAI-PMH?
Could one add "; peer-reviewed" to whatever is contained in the type field?
Anything like "dc.description.peerreviewed" will require a custom format for
OAI-PMH and diminish interoperability.

Thanks for bringing it back around, Thomas.  I was thinking the same
thing.  It seems that multiple occurences of dc:type are allowed[1], so
it would be possible to add a dc:type="peer-reviewed" to any record,
even one with a type already assigned.  

It would be easiest for us, on a local level, to follow the UK
vocabulary at
http://library.princeton.edu/departments/tsd/katmandu/html/dctype.html
and consider anything of dc:type="Article" to be peer-reviewed,
reserving dc:type="Unrefereed Article" for those cases when an article
is not peer-reviewed.  We have already been filling our dc.type field
with "Article", "Thesis", etc. and a single line in the DSpace config
file, to enable searches on the dc.type field, along with a
"type:article" in the search query allows me to pull up only those
records with this distinction.  This use of the UK vocabulary would be
for the value of type rather than the qualifier, however, for which it
was not meant.  Also, it's hard to say how widely this vocabulary has
been adopted and what kind of backing it has -- the document is ten
years old and not much referred to.

I'll be bringing this topic up on dc-general, as well.  For those who
subscribe to both lists, apologies for any perceived duplication.

Yes, there are. The aforementioned Zebra server from Indexdata (it's
OSS, http://www.indexdata.dk/) comes with example configuration for
indexing OAI-PMH responses. It's done using either the "ALVIS" or "DOM"
filter modules (they're new as of Zebra 2), which will allow you to
customize the generated indexes by means of XSLT.

Don't hesitate to ask further questions, but if it's Zebra-specific,
better ask on the Zebra mailing list.
