Subject: [OAI-implementers] confusion about the repository structure - Again
Message-ID: <492820.54872.qm@web31108.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I am really very new to the OAI/PMH and I am doing a
research where I have to come up with general
solutions which are out the scope of my research!!!
Therefore, I beg your pardon if I ask a very basic or
silly questions.

I've done some initial readings but the thing which is
I am (at this stage) confused about is how the
structure of the data providers' metadata repositories
should be. 

should the service providers produce their metadata
using the normal Dublin core (and then it would be
automatically changed by OAI/PMH into the structure
below when the metadata is harvested) or they still
should use Dublin core but they have to follow this
structure when creating the metadata files:

**************************************
header (mandatory)
 ?  identifier (mandatory: 1 only)
 ?  datestamp (mandatory: 1 only)
 ?  setSpec elements (optional: 0, 1 or more)
 ?  status attribute for deleted item

metadata (mandatory): where DC should  be used or
other metadata standareds 
 ?  
about (optional)
 ?    rights statements
 ?    provenance statements
...
...
...
***************************************
Again sorry for asking a very basic question.

Any help is really appreciated.

Fadi

The local structure of data in the repository need not follow any 
particular standard or arrangement. However, as you say, the output
in response to OAI requests must follow the format in the specification 
(which you summarize below). It is an implementation choice as to how you 
get from your internal format to the OAI-PMH format.

Cheers,
Simeon

Hi,

  I would like to be a bit more specific about my needs.
  At my work place we?re considering adding digital library capabilities to our application. We also want to have the ability to expose our records (as data provider). 
  So we?re searching for application with a nice GUI that will be simple to create and manage (preferring open source that runs on Windows).
   
  Any additional recommendations will be highly appreciated.
   
  Thanks,
  Alon
   
  BTW: I?m not new to OAI-PMH. My thesis research was about harvesting using it, but mainly from the service providers point of view, so I didn?t deal with data providers GUI etc?.

here in Bucharest Romania.
We are at the beginning, we've just finished translating specs and now
we are looking at the examples, best practices and problems that could
arrise.

Thank you once again

a Dot net tool since we are aiming this as dot net one.

Hi All,

I've recently been experimenting with the OAI-SQ[1] extension to
OAI-PMH. I have an almost complete implementation for DSpace, and I was
wondering if anyone else has implemented this extension, and what degree
of success (or otherwise) you experienced. Suggestions for alternatives
would also be appreciated if anyone knows of any.

In Invenia we have developed a GUI with ASP pages (Active Server Pages) that 
run with a MySql database. We are the first Spanish Company registrered as 
an OAI Data Provider. We also use it to harvest some repositories.

Our records and the result of the harvestinf of repositories are in the same

I hope it can help you.

Message-ID: <20070125140921.GA19675@openlib.org>


The OAI5 Organising Committee is welcoming poster submissions for the
5th Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication at CERN in
Geneva, Switzerland, which will take place from Wednesday 18th -
Friday 20th April 2007. The deadline for submissions is 31st January
2007.

Please consult the conference website for more information:
http://cern.ch/oai5

Posters are invited on projects directly related to the themes of the
workshop and decisions on acceptance will be communicated during
February. Further information is found under the call for abstracts
link on the webpage:
http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceCFA.py?confId=5710

The agenda for the workshop is also now available:
http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceOtherViews.py?view=standard&confId=5710

The OAI series of workshops is one of the biggest international
meetings of technical repository-developers, library Open Access
policy formulators, and the funders and researchers that they
serve. The programme contains a mix of practical tutorials given by
experts in the field, presentations from cutting-edge projects and
research, posters from the community, breakout discussion groups, and
an intense social programme which has helped to build a strong network
amongst previous participants. The event is almost unique in bringing
together these scholarly communication communities and is proud to
continue this tradition with the OAI5 workshop in 2007.
