Hi,

I just started to use the OAICat package. After I copied the oaicat.war
file into my tomcat webapps area and restarted the tomcat, the initial
oaicat/identify.html page works ok. But when I clicked on Submit Query, I
got the following error:

According to the documentation, this default war file should work ok. Is
there something I did wrong?

Your help is really appreciated!

Hi,

I'm just a user of OAICAt, so if I'm wrong someone please correct me.

Apparently Tomcat is having trouble loading WEB-INF/oaicat.properties from the 
war file. If you unzip the war to your webapps dir (if you're in Windows you 
will have to rename the file extension to .zip) it may solve the problem. If it 
still doesn't work, try changing the property FileSystemOAICatalog.homeDir in 
WEB-INF/oaicat.properties to the absolute path (it's wrong to use the absolute 
path, but it's for testing purposes).

Thanks a lot for the help! After I changed the
FileSystemOAICatalog.homeDir in WEB-INF/oaicat.properties, it works fine.
But I'm wondering why tomcat has trouble to load the
WEB-INF/oaicat.properties. Is there any variable that I should set to make
tomcat see this file?

Again, thanks a lot for the help!

Hi,

Sorry if this question sounds too silly but I just started to use it and
am very new to it.

In the README.txt file in the untarred folder oaicat-1.5.46, it says that
if I need to rebuild the project, I need to do the following:

To create a new distribution set, issue the command:

ant dist

But there isn't a build.xml file there, how can I use "ant dist"?

Should I make one myself or someone has one that can share?

Thanks a lot!

Ming

Ming,

The OAICat implementation is getting "long in the tooth". At one time an
Ant build was available via CVS, but for various (mostly security)
reasons it hasn't been kept up-to-date. The distribution files, though,
should be fairly current.

In the spirit of open-source I realize that an Ant build of OAICat
should be made available, but I wonder why anyone would ever want to
build it on their own. The source and pre-built oaicat.jar are readily
available along with a demo war file to get people started.

More often than not, the answer seems to be that people want to tweak
the OAICat source code and build their own custom oaicat.jar file.
Creating forks like this is a very bad idea because it makes
synchronization difficult if I update the same source files. If
customization is really necessary it would be much better to extend the
OAICat classes and add them to the classpath in a separate jar or
directly under the classes directory.

I admit that there may be situations where clients need to build OAICat
from scratch, but they are hard for me to imagine. If you really have a
need, let me know and we can work something out.

Hi Jeff

Do you have any suggestions/recommendations as to what to use instead of OAICat?

Thanks

Ming,

Back in the dark ages when OAICat was first written, I didn't know how
to access files relative to the webapp deploy location. The solutions at
the time were either to hard-code file location in various configuration
files or else use relative paths and ask people to start their Tomcat
from the $TOMCAT_HOME directory.

I've since learned how to reference relative directory locations without
these incantations, but vestiges of the old patterns still remain.

In you WEB-INF.xml file, change the properties context-param to look
like this:

    <context-param>
      <param-name>properties</param-name>
      <param-value>oaicat.properties</param-value>
    </context-param>

If you have a recent copy of the oaicat.jar file
(http://pubserv.oclc.org/oaicat/jars/dist/dist.html), the Servlet should
automatically look for it here:

WEB-INF/classes/oaicat.properties

There may be other file references that are still problematic, but this
is where everything starts.

Colin,

What I do these days is start by providing SRU access to my data. From
there OAI-PMH is just an XSL Stylesheet transform away.

http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february05/sanderson/02sanderson.html

On first blush, SRU may appear to be more heavy weight than OAI-PMH, but
it is ever so much more powerful and its relative complexity is mostly a
mirage.

Message-ID: <0K310059KSH7QXA0@messaging4.anu.edu.au>

Hi,

As promised in a previous post, we have completed an initial version of 
what we call a Harvester Service. It is a Java servlet web application 
providing HTTP services (via servlets) for scheduling and managing 
harvests and builds on OCLC's Harvester2 package. The package makes no 
assumptions about its operating environment thus allowing it to be 
deployed within existing application structures. More detailed 
information is contained in the documentation.

Note the URL provided below points to a page containing a PDF user/tech 
guide and test docs as well as the downloadable software package. An 
install guide is included in the distribution. Comprehensive javadocs 
can be built from the distribution.

Descriptive text for OAI Tools site as follows:

Tool: Harvester Service 
(http://www.apsr.edu.au/software.htm#harvester_package)
Implementer: The Australian National University (http://www.anu.edu.au)
Description:The Harvester Service is an open source OAI-PMH harvesting 
application based on OCLC's OAIHarvester2. It is a deployable webapp 
running under Tomcat providing harvest scheduling and management 
services for use by external applications. It also supports deployment 
of custom harvest classes for tailored processing on request and 
response data.


Hope it comes in useful to someone!

Scott.

I'm not sure where I should start and cannot find any instructions on this

started?

Thanks a lot!

Subject: [OAI-implementers] ubuntu 8.04 and perl redirects
Message-ID: <1214835134.6668.64.camel@antonio>

Hi,

?since we upgraded the webserver to ubuntu 8.04 the perl redirect pages
stopped working (register, users, oai, etc), so the archive
(http://eprints.stoa.it) is not beeing harvested anymore, and every perl
redirect displays a blank page.
After the upgrade we didn't change anything in apache (1.3.41) and
eprints 2.3.6 configuration (everything is compiled by hand and not
installed from ubuntu repositories), but perl pages are not working.
I guess there's something wrong with the new perl version used by ubuntu
(5.8.8.)

?We don't want to upgrade to eprints 3 because we've done a lot of work
with our open archive (italian translation, modify of config files in
order to let eprints work with other virtual servers without changing
ports).
Do you know how we can manage this issue?

thank you!

antonio basile

?Thanks Christopher,

i already tried this solution (line 2291 of session.pm) and it doesn't
solve my problem.
i'm using apache 1.3.41 compiled with mod_perl 1.30.
eprint.stoa.it worked well until i upgraded from ubuntu 7.10 to ubuntu
8.04.
i also tried to reinstall all perl modules with MCPAN and everything is
up to date.
i checked if eprints2 folder had the right owner and permission and,
yes, it has.
it's about 2 weeks i'm working on this problem and now i really don't
know what to do.


Thanks
antonio basile

Hi Ming,

a "metadataPrefix" is just a prefix that identify every metadata standard that your repository exposes.
