Subject: [OAI-implementers] question about PMH baseURLs 
Message-ID: <49D61FC7.1000709@cs.uct.ac.za>

hi

a protocol specification issue: can we have a baseURL that includes a 
"?" character (see email below from Thomas Staecker).

personally, it seems reasonable to me. the schema says anyURI for 
Identify response, which makes it valid. but the PMH narrative says that 
in order to create a request a harvester can append "?" and a 
"&"-separated parameter list to the baseURL. this causes a bit of a 
contradiction.

so, should the narrative of the PMH be changed to allow baseURLs with 
existing embedded parameters? all harvesters will then need to be aware 
of this and check for existing parameters if they are not already doing 
this.

other interoperable Web-based systems (Facebook, Sakai) already do this 
quite seamlessly. from our perspective, is a minor change for consistent 
HTTP usage worth the possible need for change to harvesters?

thoughts?

ttfn,
----hussein

Hello,

I tried to check our OAI interface against your checker, but it didn't
work because your checker assumes that there is a plain base URL. But as
we host two repositories at the moment we decided to put the base URLs
as follows: http://dbs.hab.de/oai/?repository=WDB_OPAC and
http://dbs.hab.de/oai/?repository=VKK. Your checker now tries to resolve
this URL as follows
http://dbs.hab.de/oai/?repository=WDB_OPAC?verb=Identify which leads to
an error due to the double questionmark. Is it possible to avoid the
second questionmark?

Regards,
Thomas

I believe the URI definition (still RFC 2396?  Or has that been obsoleted?)
makes it clear that you can only have one query string, and that the "?"
character is reserved within the query string.

And if the URI is "http://myserver/foo?bar?baz" how will anyone decide if "foo"
should intepret "bar?baz" or if "foo?bar" should interpret "baz"?  You should
be aware that EZProxy, which is common in library-land, often does the first
and I think you're trying to do the second.

IMO it's going to be much more successful to make the two repositories
addressable without that first query string (different path names or port
numbers come to mind).



BTW, this note from April 3 only arrived here on April 9 - apologies if this
has already been resolved.

According to the URI standard
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4>:

"The query component is indicated by the first question mark ("?")..."

This implies that an OAI-PMH request supporting HTTP GET must have a
baseURI without a question mark.

If the repository only accepted POST requests, then it could probably
get away with it. Whether it should or not is another question.

hi folks

thanks for the quick responses.

if indeed we dont want ? characters in baseURLs, the OAI schema needs to 
be changed to use a different datatype than anyURI for the baseURL; and 
it probably needs to be made explicit in the spec.

fwiw, merging of parameter lists seemed like the right thing to do (as 
all new interoperable systems do this) but it does result in invalid PMH 
requests because the PMH is defined much more narrowly than newer standards.

so, bottom line, unless i hear otherwise, i will assume we go for ?-less 
baseURLs and i will check for this in the repository explorer in future...

Subject: [OAI-implementers] question about PMH baseURLs
Message-ID: <20090409204306.GA26074@ice.library.cornell.edu>

The spec says that repositories should support BOTH GET and POST so I think 
this implies that the baseURL should not include a query component (?).

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#HTTPRequestFormat
"Repositories must support both the GET and POST methods."

If we wanted to enforce this with the schema (and perhaps rule out relative 
URIs etc.) then I think we would have to constrain the anyURI datatype with 
a pattern (regex).

Cheers,
Simeon

This is not enforced, it is just bad practice. Any services consuming the 
metadata may get confused...

Should really also tell all services consuming your metadata to delete it 
too, and then ask them to start again with new setup.

This would be to best option to persist the identifiers and data. However, 
if you change location of your server you'd still need to let consuming 
services know that.

I suppose the bottom line is that OAI-PMH does not have mechanisms to deal 
with this sort of change. One has either to resort to web-server tricks to 
make old URIs work, or else talk to consuming services to push 
configuration changes.

(Putting a technology name in the URI has just the same problems that all 
those silly URLs out there with .jsp, .asp, .cfm, .php extensions have. 
When the technology changes you either end up with confusing URLs or you 
have to break or redirect old ones...)

Simeon

Hi Regina,

>From the way you've phrased the question on oai-implementers and metadata-librarians, it sounds like you've got some metadata elements that you want to use in addition to those Dublin Core elements used in the oai_dc schema.

The short answer is that you can't add other metadata elements into the oai_dc schema.
You can, however, have multiple occurrences of any element and you can add other schemas to be exposed by OAI-PMH. This could be a qualified dc schema of your  own or someone else's design or it could be from another standard entirely. The important thing about OAI-PMH is to remember that oai_dc is the mandated set you have to expose but you can expose as many others as you wish.

However, the bigger questions is:
Why do you want/ need to share this information?

There's plenty of metadata used for local purposes that it isn't effective or necessary to share - apologies if this is an obvious statement but many repositories conflate local metadata requirements with the metadata schemas they expose for harvesting.

Also - across most archives/repositories/digital libraries oai_dc is the only metadata schema widely supported and looked for by harvesters. Yes some services pay attention to what else is exposed and the situation is improving but there isn't really much of a common denominator to take advantage of more detailed or different metadata - unless there's a particular community/ organisation/ federation/ service that you're working with. This situation is improving and if you can easily expose other standards it is a good thing to do.

I hope that begins to answer your question, without knowing a bit more of the specific issues it's hard to suggest elements or schema.

Regards,
John

We're having trouble validating against the OAI schema (testing with
xmllint & xerces).
        
It fails with any use of seconds-based granularity e.g.
http://dspace.mit.edu/dspace-oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&until=2009-03-03T00:00:00Z

The problem regexp is ".*Z", which as far as we can tell is correct but
doesn't work.
        
Any ideas?

Hi Tim,

It seems from my testing that xerces doesn't like the year zero. I get
tests to work if I change to year 0001. XSV
(http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv) is happy with year zero.

I used the following test file (simplified from the dspace URL you quote):

simeon@homebox ~>more c.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<OAI-PMH xmlns="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/
                             http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/OAI-PMH.xsd">
<responseDate>2009-04-15T12:45:43Z</responseDate>
<request metadataPrefix="oai_dc"
         until="0000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
         verb="ListRecords">http://dspace.mit.edu/oai/request</request>
<ListRecords>
<record>
  <header>
    <identifier>1</identifier>
    <datestamp>2009-04-15T12:45:43Z</datestamp>
  </header>
</record>
</ListRecords>
</OAI-PMH>

the above give an error from xerces:

simeon@homebox ~>xerceslint c.xml
[Error] c.xml:9:29: cvc-datatype-valid.1.2.2: '0000-01-01T00:00:00Z' is not a valid value of list type 'UTCdatetimeType'.
[Error] c.xml:9:29: cvc-attribute.3: The value '0000-01-01T00:00:00Z' of attribute 'until' on element 'request' is not valid with respect to its type, 'UTCdatetimeType'.

but if I change the year to 0001 xerces (2.6.2) is happy:

simeon@homebox ~>diff c.xml d.xml
8c8
<          until="0000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
---
>          until="0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"

simeon@homebox ~>xerceslint d.xml
d.xml: 899;0;0 ms (8 elems, 6 attrs, 0 spaces, 97 chars)

element[0]: OAI-PMH   in http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/

namespace[0]: http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/
              http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/OAI-PMH.xsd
namespace[1]: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
              [no schema doc]

Do you get the same in your setup?



I also did a couple of tests to probe the two parts of the definition of
UTCdatetimeType. XSV prints out nice helpful messages which suggest to me
that the base type and restruction work as planned:

## with valid dateTime but not Z
Invalid per cvc-attribute.1.2: attribute type check failed for {None}:until: 0001-01-01T00:00:00+0400 no members of union succeeded:  is not a valid date literal; does not match pattern .*Z

## with valid patter for Z but invalid dateTime
Invalid per cvc-attribute.1.2: attribute type check failed for {None}:until: A001-01-01T00:00:00Z no members of union succeeded:  is not a valid date literal; is not a valid dateTime literal


Cheers,
Simeon

Hi all:

I have been working on a Java library for OAI-PMH v2, and it's now available
at http://code.google.com/p/joailib/
I would appreciate feedback on this.
