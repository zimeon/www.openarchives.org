<PRE>Thank you, Alan!  (and Hussein!)

I will certainly consider your hack, as it's a huge improvement over
redundant records or multiple selects.

Right now, what we put in ListRecord returns varies;  I'd like to
standardize it, but there appear to be no guidelines.  I would like to
return less than GetRecord, but am wondering if perhaps I should return
the whole enchilada;  currently, the most we return is everything but the
&quot;description&quot; fields (for some sets).

If ListRecords is used by harvesters to gather entire records quickly,
and GetRecord is NOT used much (cumbersome, one record at a time), then
I should want to include all of the record fields.

If however, harvesters are using &lt;subject&gt; fields (or some such) in
ListRecord returns to determine what they want to get as full records
--and ignoring all else -- returning entire records is not worth the
time and work for either end... and then &lt;subject&gt; fields would be
very important (to me) to include.

The 2.0 ListRecord examples only contain the following fields:
title, creator, type, source, language, identifier;  but Hussein tells
me there are no actual guidelines for this.
