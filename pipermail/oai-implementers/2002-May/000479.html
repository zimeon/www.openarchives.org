The &lt;about&gt; is for information about the harvested metadata, particularly
the intellectual rights and the origin, NOT for the resource.

Tim Cole, in another email reply, has provided a useful review of the issues
over whether the metadata describes the original resource or the digitized
object.  There are ways that DC, particularly the source and relation
elements, can be used to 'solve' this problem. However, unless there is a
common approach, there will be interoperability problems for resource
discovery when searching against metadata harvested from different OAI
providers.

My thinking is that having metadata describe the original item is the
simplest and most acceptable approach; the original item might, of course,
be in digital format.  The only difference between the metadata of a
physical item and a digital manifestation would be the format, which could
be SGML or JPEG for the digital object.  If the intellectual content of the
digital object differs from the original then the metadata should describe
the digital object, the date element being the creation date of the digital
object. 

The 2 examples in section 5 of the OAI-PMH 2.0 beta
(<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm</A>) follow this
approach, although an available date is included in the second example.  

Some of the draft DC-Library Application Profile
(<A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/library-application-profile_200204.html">http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/library-application-profile_200204.html</A>) also
supports this view. For example the mandatory Date Created says &quot;Use for the
creation of the intellectual content&quot;.  Perhaps this forum is an appropriate
place for these issues to be resolved whilst the profile is still a draft?
I agree with Tim that when it comes to the museum world, creation date is
probably inappropriate for a rock sample!  Coverage tends to be used more in
this domain. 

What do others think?

Hi, Kevin--

What you have said supports my understanding of the &lt;about&gt; tag 
&quot;as a means to provide information regarding the origins of the metadata
part of the record&quot;.  
(<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI_protocol/2.x/openarchivesprotocol.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/OAI_protocol/2.x/openarchivesprotocol.htm</A>)

Let me see if I understand your position correctly:

If the item under discussion is an issue of a slavery-era local
newspaper, (such as our Emancipator set) the &quot;publisher&quot; and &quot;rights&quot;
fields are those that apply to the original newspaper;  &quot;creator&quot; would
perhaps be the company or editor; format would be (perhaps)
newsprint; &quot;date&quot; would be the date of original printing.

   Then, perhaps in the &lt;about&gt; tag section, information would be entered
such as current rights access to the digitized material;  publisher of the
digitzation;  creator of the digitized object;  date of digitization,
and here, format might be SGML and/or JPEG.

Thus, if the item under discussion were a book, the &quot;identifier&quot; in the
regular dc section would likely be the ISBN, whereas the &quot;identifier&quot; in
the &quot;about&quot; section would likely be the unique OAI identifier, the URL at
which the digitized object(s) could be viewed, a CORC ID, and so on.

Am I understanding you correctly?

And then if the oai_dc file were to be translated into a QUALIFIED Dublin
Core record, the information in the &quot;about&quot; tag section would somehow be
incorporated with the information in the rest of the file???


Thank you for your time and clarification.

</I>&gt;<i>  I know this is a simple and perhaps stupid question, but I'd rather
</I>&gt;<i> *look* stupid than *be* stupid.  We have some confusion over here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Do the Dublin Core elements describe the original item, or the
</I>&gt;<i>     digitized objects made from that item?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The DC webpages simply say all the elements refer to the &quot;resource&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm not clear as to whether that &quot;resource&quot; is the digital one,
</I>&gt;<i> or the  original item.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Example:
</I>&gt;<i>    A multi-page letter, written in 1869, is the original document;
</I>&gt;<i>    An SGML transcription with accompanying JPEGs for each page,
</I>&gt;<i>       comprise the digitized object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Does the &quot;date&quot; element refer to the creation of the digitized object,
</I>&gt;<i>    or the date the letter was written?
</I>&gt;<i>  Does the &quot;creator&quot; refer to the person who scanned the document and
</I>&gt;<i>    transcribed its contents, or does it refer to the original author
</I>&gt;<i>    of the letter?
</I>&gt;<i>  Does the &quot;format&quot; list text/sgml and JPEGS, or simply text?  And
</I>&gt;<i>    if this original document was an old JPEG about which metadata
</I>&gt;<i>    was created, is the correct format JPEG and that metadata format?
</I>&gt;<i>    Or just &quot;photgraph&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  I have found we have a mix of both in our files at present, and I need
</I>&gt;<i>  some clarity so I can clean up this mess and prevent future madness!!
</I>&gt;<i>   (I would like my scripts and repository to be correct!!!)
</I>&gt;<i>
