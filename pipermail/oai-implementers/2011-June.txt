Hi Everyone,

We've been using Greenstone for a long time and it continues to serve us
well. Thanks to the developers and this community for the help we've
received.

The place where we feel Greenstone doesn't fully meet our needs is in
collection creation, especially in terms of data entry and the lack of
controlled vocabularies. Thus, we've developed Ibidem (
http://www.maflt.org/products/Ibidem), which is focused on the front end
data entry process and provides user definable Lookup Tables. We had the
original intent to include full work flow processing, but that might come
down the road.

For Greenstone users, Ibidem exposes its content via OAI-PMH (thanks to
OAICAT). So you can use Ibidem for data entry and then import it into
Greenstone if you like.

Here's the official announcement: http://www.tinyurl.com/ibidemrelease

God's Love,

sounds cool, your demo server isn't running... any chance to get that up?
did you consider building this in drupal as it has great taxonomy tools as
well as oai-pmh compatability = also has dublin core built in, z39.50 etc..
plus a flexible architecture & large library support.  will look forward to
see the demo to see what it offers

It's working again now, at least for the moment. Cloud Foundry is a new
service from VMWare and is very much still beta. But it makes deployment to
the cloud brain dead. It's going to be great once they get a few things
worked out.

We use Drupal for our site, so I'm not sure why we didn't look at it for the
digital library stuff. But the decision was made before I started at MAF.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI-PMH for Nesstar Servers
Message-ID: <1307690309.3136.31.camel@nsd244l>

Hi,

We at Nesstar have implemented the OAI-PMH protocol to work with Nesstar
servers and recently released the first beta version to the public.

The implementation can disseminate studies from one Nesstar server in
both Dublin Core and DDI metadata formats and so far we have implemented
the methods Identify, GetRecord, ListIdentifiers, and
ListMetadataFormats which should be enough to get started.

The package is a regular war file you can deploy to Tomcat or similar
application server. It's even possible to dump the package in an
existing Nesstar server next to its own web interface.

The server only uses methods from the new public Nesstar API
(http://nesstar.com/software/public_api.html) so if you want, you can
write your own OAI-PMH server for Nesstar.

If you're interested, read more and download the package here:
http://nesstar.com/software/oai_pmh_server.html 

Note that this is still beta software and there may be some bugs. Any
feedback would be appreciated!

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Question on flow control / resumption token
Message-ID: <71B5A2C57E0AD04F97E997AA244D455E025F241F@BEDIVERE.alfredst.oxford-analytica.local>

Hi,

We're implementing a repository in OAI-PMH (not public at this stage),
and I have a query where the specification isn't very clear.

It's about flow control.

Taking ListIdentifiers as an example, is the resumptionToken the ONLY
argument which a client MUST supply to resume an incomplete list? Or
must they also supply the other original arguments?

Or to put it another way, if we receive a query with from and until
parameters set, and we send back an incomplete list with a resumption
token, then when the client submits a request using the resumption
token, can we also expect them to supply again the from and until
parameters?

This affects what information we need to store about the request against
the resumption token.

Example:

First request:  
http://some.where/oaipmh?verb=ListIdentifiers&from=2011-06-29T03:05:00Z&
until=2011-06-30T03:05:00Z

To which response includes resumptionToken abcdefgh

Must the second request then be

http://some.where/oaipmh?verb=ListIdentifiers&from=2011-06-29T03:05:00Z&
until=2011-06-30T03:05:00Z&resumptionToken=abcdefgh

OR is it legitimate for a client just to ask this:

http://some.where?verb=ListIdentifiers&resumptionToken=abcdefgh

Thanks for the tip.

Moray,

The spec calls resumptionToken an "exclusive" argument, meaning that it is 
the only argument that should be used.  from section 4:

# exclusive, the argument may be included with request, but must be the 
only argument (in addition to the verb argument).

this means your rT "abcdefgh" must logically encode the other arguments: 
set, from, until, etc. as well as the cursor through the result set.

this can be done in two ways:

1.  server-side result set (supported in some systems)

2.  encoded in the rT itself (the most common approach).

some these rTs are opaque, e.g.:

http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/OAI-2.0?verb=ListIdentifiers&metadataPrefix=oai_dc 
-->
http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/OAI-2.0?verb=ListIdentifiers&resumptionToken=1309451189

and some are not, e.g.:

http://amsacta.cib.unibo.it/cgi/oai2?verb=ListIdentifiers&metadataPrefix=oai_dc 
-->
http://amsacta.cib.unibo.it/cgi/oai2?verb=ListIdentifiers&resumptionToken=metadataPrefix%3Doai_dc%26offset%3D1908

It is quite dated now, but here are the slides from a tutorial we gave at 
JCDL 2003:

http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/jcdl03/oai-2.0-adv.ppt

but there is some guidance on different strategies for creating rTs.

hope this helps,

Michael
