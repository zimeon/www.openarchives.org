<PRE>DLPS at the University of Michigan is pleased to announce our suite of 
open-source OAI data provider and service provider tools. These tools, 
all written in perl, include:

+ data provider software designed to map DLXS Bibliographic Class 
collections to oai_dc
+ harvester software based on Ed Summers' N:O:H harvester APIs
+ transformation tool to transform harvested oai_dc metadata into DLXS 
Bibliographic Class, ready for indexing

The data provider software, called broker, connects to a MySQL or CSV 
database and uses the xpat search engine to serve up records. The DLXS 
collection management tool, collmgr, is an integral part of broker.

The harvester, called UMHarvester, is a more stand-alone tool than the 
other two. It will harvest more than one data provider at a time via a 
simple, command-line interface and stores logs of successful or failed 
harvests. It allows for set harvesting Currently, it will not perform 
incremental harvests, but we would like to add this feature soon-ish.

The transformation tool, called OAITransform, counts records, records 
with DC Identifiers and deleted records, as well as filtering out those 
records without DC Identifiers and adding a DC Type normalization 
element. It will also pinpoint UTF-8 character errors.

Future work will incorporate both MODS and MARC mapping and 
transformations.

If anyone is interested in one or more of these tools, let us know and 
we'll send them your way. We are investigating adding them to 
SourceForge, along with the rest of DLXS materials, and also to our 
dlxs.org website as an OAI tools package.
