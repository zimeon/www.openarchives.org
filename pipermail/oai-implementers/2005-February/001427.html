<PRE>Hi Steven,

The UIUC registry has a couple different groupings of OAI repositories 
that you might find useful:

   <A HREF="http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListVirtualColls.asp">http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListVirtualColls.asp</A>

The list includes OAIster, Eprints,and others.  The OAIster list is 
pretty up-to-date since I get a monthly feed from Kat.  However, the 
others are certainly out-of-date.

We are always willing to share records with other registries, so if 
there are any sorts of special export formats that might be useful let 
us know and we could attempt to accommodate.

We are actually starting to collect additional collection-level 
description for many of these repositories, and would be interested in 
what data people would find useful.

Kind regards,
	Tom Habing

&gt;<i> Dear Tim, Kat and OAI-implementers,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Several things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, I have done by hand the first imported set of OAI Base URLs
</I>&gt;<i> that Tim imported for me for
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://archives.eprints.org/eprints.php">http://archives.eprints.org/eprints.php</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It was worth the time and effort as not only did the
</I>&gt;<i> archive number rise to 363 and the Eprints subset to 159, but I
</I>&gt;<i> now have a good idea of the kinds of OAI-compliant archives there
</I>&gt;<i> are, and many of them are not relevant to OA: They are sites that have
</I>&gt;<i> merely made themselves OAI-compliant to increase their visibility.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That includes commercial product/service sites and University
</I>&gt;<i> Library catalgues and home pages -- both completely irrelevant
</I>&gt;<i> to OA and its goals (and introducing noise into OA-space:
</I>&gt;<i> Must remember: OAI is much, much wider than OA!).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second, I would like to import more. What was that first list?
</I>&gt;<i> The UIUC registry (all of it?). 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/">http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What else can we now import.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One obvious one is all of OAIster: I will go over it all by hand
</I>&gt;<i> and remove all the archives that are not full-text OA content.
</I>&gt;<i> (Kat, could we have a file with all the OAIster archives
</I>&gt;<i> URLs and OAI BaseURLs? I can take it from there.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Third, Tim, I'm not sure why the totals are not tallying in
</I>&gt;<i> the Registry: We have 159 institutional Archives now, but
</I>&gt;<i> your analysis only covers 90 of them: Is that because the rest
</I>&gt;<i> are not in celestial? But than please let us do something about
</I>&gt;<i> that, to get them in!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, of the 159 GNU Eprints Archives, only 120 are picked up
</I>&gt;<i> by your analysis: celestial again? Important to maximise 
</I>&gt;<i> celestial's coverage!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Last thing: There are 4 remaining archives in the buffer:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> edoc.mpg.de (I have that already, and it says so, but I can't
</I>&gt;<i> remove it from the buffer)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> nsdlib.nsdl.cornell.edu -- that might be an important one, but I
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't get a connection to verify it
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> www.auborn.edu -- that is one of those annoying ones that pop out
</I>&gt;<i> of the buffer automatically: I need a &quot;safe&quot; viewer even for
</I>&gt;<i> the buffer stage, as with such archives I cannot make them &quot;dead&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> as it stand!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> www.numdam.org is, like mpg, already in the registry, and it
</I>&gt;<i> tells me so, but it won't let me remove it from the buffer!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please import more OAI baseURL lists as soon as you can, 
</I>&gt;<i> especially OAIster
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (And any autjomatic checking you can get it to do -- to see
</I>&gt;<i> is we have it already and de-dupe, would sure help minimise
</I>&gt;<i> my time and keystrokes!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers, Stevan
