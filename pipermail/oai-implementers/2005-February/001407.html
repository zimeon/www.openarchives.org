<PRE>I'm taking the liberty of copying a message to the dspace-tech list here,
since I propose the use of the HTML &lt;link&gt; tag and I know that my previous
suggestions about using this tag on this list have only received a
luke-warm response! :-)

These suggestions stem from the need for Google robots to auto-discover
the OAI BASEURL for any given repository.

So I'd be interested in thoughts on my suggestions below - particularly on
whether we need something like an 'application/oai+xml' MIME type
registration (to say that the XML conforms to one of the responses in the
OAI-PMH).

No, not really!  Clearly the 'well known location' approach (like
robots.txt) works well in many cases, but it is not without problems -
particularly for those people who want to run repositories on servers
where they don't have access to create a file (or whatever) at the chosen
location.

More importantly, I think that any agreements that you (the DSpace
community) reach with Google need to scale not just to all DSpace users,
but to those who choose to offer their repositories using other software
(like eprints.org) and even to those who choose to base their repositories
on more mainstream technologies like content management systems.

So, I don't think that a 'DSpace well known location' is the right
approach.  I offer two alternatives, neither of which is particularly well
thought thru - but these ideas might be a useful basis for further
refinement?

1) Embed a &lt;link rel=&quot;oaipmh&quot; ...&gt; tag into the &lt;head&gt; section of the
repository home page, linking to the BASEURL of the OAI server for that
repository (note, there is no requirement that the BASEURL is on the same
Web server as the repository itself - this is a completely open linking
mechanism).  E.g.

&lt;link rel=&quot;oaipmh&quot; type=&quot;application/xml&quot;  title=&quot;OAI BASEURL&quot;
href=&quot;<A HREF="http://etheses.nottingham.ac.uk/perl/oai2&quot;">http://etheses.nottingham.ac.uk/perl/oai2&quot;</A> /&gt;

2) Embed a &lt;link rel=&quot;meta&quot; ...&gt; tag into the &lt;head&gt; section of each
eprint's 'jump-off' page (sorry, my terminology is probably wrong in the
context of DSpace here), linking to an OAI GetRecord request for the
metadata about the current eprint.  E.g.

&lt;link rel=&quot;meta&quot; type=&quot;application/xml&quot; title=&quot;OAI/DC Metadata&quot;
href=&quot;<A HREF="http://etheses.nottingham.ac.uk/perl/oai2?verb=GetRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=oai_dc&amp;identifier=oai%3Aetheses.nottingham.ac.uk.OAI2%3A1&quot;">http://etheses.nottingham.ac.uk/perl/oai2?verb=GetRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=oai_dc&amp;identifier=oai%3Aetheses.nottingham.ac.uk.OAI2%3A1&quot;</A>
/&gt;

Option 1 has the advantage of being OAI-specific (but not
DSpace-specific), i.e. the Google robot (or any other robot for that
matter) would know that it would have to deal with the OAI protocol at the
end of a rel=&quot;oaipmh&quot; link.

Option 2 has the advantage of being in line with existing conventions
(e.g. DCMI recommendations) for linking from an HTML page to some metadata
about that page.  However, it would probably benefit from a more specific
MIME type, e.g. application/oai+xml, which doesn't exist yet AFAIK.

Given that the 'jump-off' page is generated dynamically by the system (I
assume) there is no significant overhead with option 2 (in terms of having
to manually embed lots of link tags).

Clearly, both approaches could be used in tandem.  However, given minimal
knowledge about the workings of the OAI protocol, it would be possible for
the Google robots to work out the BASEURL of a repository having seen the
first of the GetRecord URLs embedded in option 2.  Therefore, option 1
might be unnecessary if option 2 is being used.

Thoughts?
