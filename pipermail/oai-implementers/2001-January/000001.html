Subject: MARC to DC Translator (ALPHA)
 
Sorry for the cross-posting.
 
While working on an OAI repository, I had the need to convert 
MARC communication format records to unqualified Dublin Core. 
I searched the web for such a tool, without success, and 
decided to write one based on OCLC's CORC system. I suspect 
such a service would be useful for others as well, so I'd 
like to announce the availability of the server for 
evaluation purposes. Its status should be considered alpha, 
and I can't make any long-term promises about its continued 
availability yet.

I've set up a form from which records can be submitted to the 
server at <A HREF="http://purl.org/alcme/marc2dc/index.html.">http://purl.org/alcme/marc2dc/index.html.</A> If you 
look closely, you'll see some caveats listed on the form, as 
well as a reference to a file containing a few test records 
I've put out on the web for you to play with.
  
Until it's been scrutinized, I wouldn't recommend that you 
trust the results as definitive. I would also request that 
you don't overburden the server by converting your entire 
OPAC just yet. Just give it a poke and let me know what you 
think. I'd be particularly interested in information and 
perhaps even the comparison of results  with any other MARC 
to DC converters that people may know about.
 
 Thanks,
 Jeff
