Of course, we can easily do so by sending a ListRecords request to R which includes the argument set=institution:florida. We can even keep our local database in sync with R by scheduling a daily ListRecords request to R which does not only include the argument set=institution:florida but also the relevant "from" and "until" datestamps.

Indeed. If you are harvesting a particular set from the data provider
then you will not be able to tell if an item moves out of that
set. See, for example,
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2003-October/001036.html
and other parts of that thread.

>The only solution I can think of was to reset the "from" datestamp of our harvester request to some date way back in the past and do a full re-sync but is there also a way which is less brute-force?

Not specifying the "from" and "until" datastamps will do a complete
re-harvest. In the case that you are harvesting from only a particular
set then this is the only way to be sure you know whether items have
moved out of the set.

In the case that you are harvesting the entire repository then,
provided the data provider updates an item's datestamp for set
membership changes, then you will be able to pick up set membership
changes.

This is an understood flaw in the sets mechanism and one of the
reasons that I think sets should be used only to support selective
harvesting needs. I.e. unless you really expect someone to want to
harvest just the institution:nebraska or institution:florida sets, it
is probably best not to create them. If the goal is to indicate a
metadata property then that should go in the metadata.

Cheers,
Simeon
