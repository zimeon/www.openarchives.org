Allow me to second that, but from another side. One way that I'd like
to use OAI is to take records originated at other sites, and add
metadatda. I'd rather have records disappear and reappear silently
than to change IDs, because a changed ID means that my added metadata
is lost. But an ideal solution would have permanent IDs, and correctly
include information about disappearing and appeard records in
incremental updates.
