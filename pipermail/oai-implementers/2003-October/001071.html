<PRE>hi

there is already a &quot;setDescription&quot; container associated with any set 
that can do this, possibly using the &quot;branding&quot; format that you can find 
in the OAI guidelines.

see section 3.2 on <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines.htm</A>

</I>&gt;<i> No. LCSH is not international.  It is used in many places, but the
</I>&gt;<i> policies and practices do not include an attempt to serve international
</I>&gt;<i> needs (to judge from discussions of the problem issues that required
</I>&gt;<i> policy decisions, when I had a detail to the part of LC that maintains
</I>&gt;<i> LCSH).  LCSH is also enormous.  I remember an analysis in the fairly
</I>&gt;<i> early
</I>&gt;<i> days of OAI by Old Dominion that implied that LC didn't use controlled
</I>&gt;<i> vocabulary in its subject terms in OAI records, because of the number of
</I>&gt;<i> distinct terms in our records.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Back to sets in OAI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that discussion about what is useful for harvesters is valuable.
</I>&gt;<i> If there is good evidence that certain practices for sets work for
</I>&gt;<i> certain categories of service providers, data providers who care
</I>&gt;<i> about whether or how their stuff appears in those particular services
</I>&gt;<i> may take steps to use sets that aren't related to internal processes or
</I>&gt;<i> organization.  Absent any such evidence, you can hardly blame them for
</I>&gt;<i> doing what is easy.  And for many, there are no resources to do
</I>&gt;<i> anything more than a simple technical transformation from internal
</I>&gt;<i> records.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For what it's worth, the issue of how early implementer were using sets
</I>&gt;<i> was looked at in the technical discussions that led to the development
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> version 2 of OAI-PMH.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Out of 49 repositories, 39 are using sets. Of these 13 appear to
</I>&gt;<i> partition their collection by subject area, 13 by genre, and 9 by source
</I>&gt;<i> of records.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See the table at the end of 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/oai/collection-description/wh">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/oai/collection-description/wh</A>
</I>&gt;<i> itepaper.html
</I>&gt;<i> for more detail.  [Thanks to Andy Powell for being a pack-rat and still
</I>&gt;<i> having the file at the URL I found by mining my e-mail!]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not clear that anyone was using sets to provide fine-grained
</I>&gt;<i> subject
</I>&gt;<i> breakdowns (which some repositories now are).  There may be communities
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> interest where that is useful and feasible, but in the cultural heritage
</I>&gt;<i> area (personal papers, digitized, manuscripts, photographs, museum
</I>&gt;<i> artifacts, etc.) there is plenty of evidence that agreement on &quot;topical&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> terminology and rules for application across heterogeneous domains is
</I>&gt;<i> neither feasible, nor indeed helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the content in the LCOA1 repository, LC has more interest in
</I>&gt;<i> creating
</I>&gt;<i> sets that are useful for Kat Hagedorn (OAIster) and Sara Shreeves (UIUC)
</I>&gt;<i> and other service providers that focus on building services that are
</I>&gt;<i> likely to serve people to whom our digitized historical content is of
</I>&gt;<i> interest.  My sense is that a set breakdown that suits those service
</I>&gt;<i> -providers (and this sort of content) would be very different from a
</I>&gt;<i> breakdown that is useful for current scientific scholarly communication.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps providers of production services can indicate if this list
</I>&gt;<i> is a useful forum for discussing what practices in relation to sets make
</I>&gt;<i> sense to them.  They may be having discussions within a community
</I>&gt;<i> through
</I>&gt;<i> other lists or meetings.
