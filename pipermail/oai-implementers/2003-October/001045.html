Best easiest solution I could see was to say records could not change
their set membership. If they need to, then create a new record with
a new id.

Problems arise because records can belong to multiple sets. A harvester
may collect using two sets from the one repository. Generating 'set update'
messages or something gets nasty and confusing. I think its better to
come up with a solution that does not require any additions to the spec
in terms of new packets etc.

Maybe another way is to delete then create the item (and hence all
records derived from that item) so harvesters think the record (with the
old set membership) goes away first, then comes back to life again (with
the new set membership).
