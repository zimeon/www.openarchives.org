The POI stuff hasn't been shared very widely on this list - though Jeff
has alluded to it on a couple of occassions.  So here's an announcement...

 The PURL-based Object Identifier (POI)
 <A HREF="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/poi/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/poi/</A>

Jeff Young, Thom Hickey and myself wrote this proposal some time ago but
unfortunately we (or perhaps I should say, I) haven't had time to push it
forward very successfully.  The intention, as it says in the introduction,
is to provide a &quot;relatively persistent identifier for resources that are
described by metadata 'items' in OAI-compliant repositories&quot; and that
builds on the investment people are already making in assigning
oai-identifiers to the OAI 'items' that describe those resources.

A second document...

 POI resolver guidelines
 <A HREF="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/poi/resolver-guidelines/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/poi/resolver-guidelines/</A>

describes how to configure the PURL system to resolve POIs.

I'd be very interested in people's comments on this proposal.
Furthermore I'd be interested in views on whether/how we should move this
forward - as an article in D-Lib Magazine, as an RFC, or as something
else?
