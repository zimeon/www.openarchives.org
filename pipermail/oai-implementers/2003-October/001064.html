For an interesting view of set usage across different OAI repositories look 
at my Experimental OAI Registry at <A HREF="http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/,">http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/,</A> 
specifically the miscellaneous reports:

   Repositories Sorted by Number of Sets
   Frequently Occurring Distinct Set Specs
   Browse All Distinct Set Specs (hex encoded set are decoded)
   Frequently Occurring Distinct Set Names
   Browse All Distinct Set Names

 From this it appears that set usage is all over the place.  There are some 
repositories that have more sets than they do individual records.  There are 
also many that list sets for which they have no records.  And, while I 
understand why it was done, I am finding the setSpecs that are hex encoded 
strings to be quite annoying -- my OAI pet peeve of the moment. :-)

Anyway, I guess I am seconding the call for some set standardization as long 
as it stays simple.  I also like Sarah Shreeves idea that this should be 
driven in large part by service providers and not just metadata providers.

Kind regards,
	Tom
