<PRE>I didn't notice any responses to this.  I'd say this is a hole in the spec.
If a record changes its set membership, no notification would be given on an
incremental harvest of that set.  I suspect that few are running into this
because 1) set membership tends to be fairly static and 2) most harvesting
is done as full harvests, not incrementally.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [OAI-implementers] Moving records in and out of sets
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I have been too busy (too lazy?) to read the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> carefully, but
</I>&gt;<i> someone ask me recently what happens if a harvester uses sets 
</I>&gt;<i> to harvest
</I>&gt;<i> a subset of a collection, and then a record moves in and out 
</I>&gt;<i> of that set.
</I>&gt;<i> I could not work it out from a quick skim read of what I think are the
</I>&gt;<i> relevant sections of the spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If a record starts in the set, it will be harvested.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it then is updated so that it no longer belongs to that set, it
</I>&gt;<i> wont be returned in the next harvest - no delete (the record has not
</I>&gt;<i> been deleted), no update (it does not match the set), etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the record is then updated (but not put back into the set), it will
</I>&gt;<i> not be returned (its not in the set being harvested).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then if its updated and put back into the set, the harvest should pick
</I>&gt;<i> it up again as being updated and in the set.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it is updated again and removed from the set, then 
</I>&gt;<i> deleted, the harvest
</I>&gt;<i> will not pick it up because it was not in that set when it 
</I>&gt;<i> was deleted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does the above make sense? Is there something I am missing? Or is it
</I>&gt;<i> that records can never change their set membership? (Or is it just
</I>&gt;<i> an unfortunate little aspect of OAI that is not a problem often enough
</I>&gt;<i> to make it worth worrying about?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> Alan
