&gt;<i> I can see reason for wanting branding at the set level, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> have been more interested in getting rich set descriptions 
</I>&gt;<i> out there to see if harvesters found them useful [the answer 
</I>&gt;<i> from the harvesters I care about has been &quot;yes&quot;].  I used 
</I>&gt;<i> Dublin Core because it was there.  If someone else wanted to 
</I>&gt;<i> create a schema that added a branding element, I would use 
</I>&gt;<i> it.

It seems appropriate to mention here that the DCMI Collection
Description Working Group 

<A HREF="http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/">http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/</A>

(to which I know several people here already contribute) is currently
working on developing a simple Dublin Core-based schema (a DC
&quot;application profile&quot; in DCMI terminology) for collection-level
description. 

It seems to me such a schema could be deployed to describe either the
content of an entire repository or a set, as suggested in the document
Caroline pointed to. And one of the requests from WG members was that
the schema should include a property that provided a pointer to a
(collection-specific) logo. 

That property is not listed in the current draft 

<A HREF="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/collection-ap-summary/2003-08-25/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/collection-ap-summary/2003-08-25/</A>

as I've been too busy in the last few days to produce a new draft that
reflects the decisions at our meeting at DC-2003

<A HREF="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0310&L=dc-collections&T=0">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0310&amp;L=dc-collections&amp;T=0</A>
&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=59

But I'll have an updated version out, umm, real soon....
