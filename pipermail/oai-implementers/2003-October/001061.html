<PRE>I believe what you are proposing is perfectly legal, but there is no
implication in OAI that A:C has anything to do with B:C, and no way to
harvest collection C without specifying a community of A or B.  Of course
the set description could explain all this and a group could come to
agreement as to how the sets were going to be used.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: RE: [OAI-implementers] Sets in OAI-PMH and DSpace
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The set structure in OAI is very simple, but also has almost 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complete flexibility, so I'm sure you could encode any 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relationships that DSpace is aware of in them.  But the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; retrieval on sets is quite limited, so it isn't clear what 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; good it would do.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with Hussein -- keep them simple.  For DSpace, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possibly a unique ID for each collection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My understanding was that sets could be flat or hierarchical; 
</I>&gt;<i> presumably this means a strict hierarchy, i.e. no node could 
</I>&gt;<i> have &gt;1 parent -- is this correct?  If so, DSpace could not 
</I>&gt;<i> expose the case where a Collection appears in two 
</I>&gt;<i> Communities, since the same Collection would have two 
</I>&gt;<i> setSpecs.  However, thinking about it, maybe this is actually 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, since that Collection would effectively be two OAI sets 
</I>&gt;<i> with two separate setSpecs; for selective harvesting 
</I>&gt;<i> purposes, harvesters don't necessarily need to know that the 
</I>&gt;<i> two sets are in fact the same Collection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a quick example in case this isn't clear... Collection 
</I>&gt;<i> C is contained in Community A and Community B:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Community A      Community B
</I>&gt;<i>         \          /
</I>&gt;<i>          \        /
</I>&gt;<i>           \      /
</I>&gt;<i>          Collection C
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The exposed OAI set structure would be:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> setSpec     setName
</I>&gt;<i>  A          Community A
</I>&gt;<i>  A:C        Collection C
</I>&gt;<i>  B          Community B
</I>&gt;<i>  B:C        Collection C
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any reason why the above might be 'illegal' in 
</I>&gt;<i> OAI-PMH?  Might any harvesters get confused?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. sorry if cross-posting to dspace-tech &amp; oai-implementers 
</I>&gt;<i> caused any duplication weirdness... I for one seemed to get 
</I>&gt;<i> about 6 copies of replies, I don't know whether that was the 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing lists or my client getting confused though!
