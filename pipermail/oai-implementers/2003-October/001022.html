<PRE>Tom,

A first glance suggests that this is a very interesting view of the OAI
landscape from many perspectives.  For me, your report on our OAI data
provider at LC provides a useful view of our repository that I can point
others at (e.g. for the record counts).  I'm assuming part of the
motivation for creating it was for UIUC to select content for harvesting.  
I can certainly see its value for potential harvesters who are doing
manual selection of cultural heritage content in focused areas.  I can
image the search feature being particularly useful to take advantage of
rich set descriptions.  

One comment.  It took me some time to see that the link from a number of
records in the count table was actually a way to sample record(s) included
in the indexing.  For understanding why a search generated a hit, I think
it would be useful to be able to get to the complete set of samples for a
repository from the repository summary -- or to get straight to the
samples that generated hits from the hits list.  Just a thought.

As a small aside, special characters are not being handled gracefully.  
When I view <A HREF="http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/details.asp?id=103">http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/details.asp?id=103</A> in
Netscape 7.02 or IE 6.0 the description and title in cyrillic for the
grabill set are not coming through.  I realize there are a lot of things
that could be wrong (and haven't had time for detective work).  Are other
seeing the same problem?

Thanks again for the tool and summary reports.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is to announce the availability of a new experimental registry of OAI 
</I>&gt;<i> providers.  The registry can be found at:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/">http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The registry was constructed by collecting the baseURLs of all the providers 
</I>&gt;<i> we could from various ListFriends.pl sites, Hussein's repository explorer, 
</I>&gt;<i> etc., as well as a search tool developed using the Google SOAP API to search 
</I>&gt;<i> for possible baseURLs (surprisingly this yielded 30+ new provider sites). 
</I>&gt;<i> Once this list of baseURLs was compiled, a crawler harvested select data 
</I>&gt;<i> from each provider, such as Identify, ListSets, ListMetadataFormats, as well 
</I>&gt;<i> as a collection of sample records, and record counts for each combination of 
</I>&gt;<i> set and metadata format (if possible).  The crawler also traversed to 
</I>&gt;<i> baseURLs found in friends containers or via the provenance container from 
</I>&gt;<i> sample records.  This resulted in a list of about 340 OAI providers which 
</I>&gt;<i> are able to respond, plus about 90 providers which seem to be down.  Many of 
</I>&gt;<i> these are versions of the same provider using different versions of the 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol, still this list is about twice as big as any other list I've come 
</I>&gt;<i> across.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, it is searchable, which was my primary goal, to make it easier to find 
</I>&gt;<i> relevant OAI providers.  Essentially I have constructed a full-text index on 
</I>&gt;<i> each repository's Identify, ListSets, ListMetdataFormats, and a collection 
</I>&gt;<i> of sample records.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have also done some analysis and made various reports available, such as 
</I>&gt;<i> repositories which support compression, a count of the most frequently 
</I>&gt;<i> occurring top-level domains, etc.  Check out the &quot;graph of friends&quot; showing 
</I>&gt;<i> a graphical representation of interconnections between repositories either 
</I>&gt;<i> via friends or provenance.  Did you know that there are 52 distinct XML 
</I>&gt;<i> metadata schemas in use by OAI repositories!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Based on this database I also have developed an experimental OAI redirector. 
</I>&gt;<i>   If you have an OAI identifier (i.e. oai:PITTAEI.OAI2:558) but don't know 
</I>&gt;<i> where it came from, submit it to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/rx?oai:PITTAEI.OAI2:558">http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/rx?oai:PITTAEI.OAI2:558</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and you will be redirected to the oai_dc format record for that id, if an 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate baseURL can be found in the registry database.  Unfortunately it 
</I>&gt;<i> appears than many sites, especially the GenericEprints, are using the same 
</I>&gt;<i> repo identifier (see <A HREF="http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListRepoIds.asp">http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListRepoIds.asp</A>), 
</I>&gt;<i> so if there are multiple possible baseURLs for a given id, I have a ranking 
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm that attempts to guess the best. I may do some more work on this 
</I>&gt;<i> in the future, maybe looking at an OpenURL type resolver function.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, feel free to try it out and let me know of any problems or 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions you might have.  Also, if you know of any more OAI providers I 
</I>&gt;<i> should add let me know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 	Tom
