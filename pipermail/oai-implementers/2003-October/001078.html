<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2003-April/000829.html">http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2003-April/000829.html</A>

Quoting Andy: &quot;The item identifier is not the same as the resource 
identifier - because the item is not the same as the resource.&quot;

Therefore an OAI harvester should not rely upon the OAI identifier being 
in any way persistent for the resource. In a distributed system - 
especially with author-contributed resources - it is likely that there 
will be dupes, revisions, parts under multiple OAI identifiers and 
multiple repositories using the same OAI identifiers for different 
resources.

It is the *metadata* that describes the resource, not the OAI header, 
and it is the metadata that should contain a persistent, globally unique 
identifier for that resource (e.g. a DOI in DC.identifier).

I can't think of another solution to this set maintainence bug than 
&quot;changing id&quot; (flagging the old OAI item deleted, creating a new OAI 
item). Creating new sets  would seem to create more problems than it 
would solve (which is moving the goal-posts on harvesters).

All the best,
Tim.
