<PRE>Announcement [crossposted]

CERN Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication: 
&quot;Implementing the benefits of OAI&quot; 
3rd Workshop on the Open Archives Initiative (OAI3)

LIBER, SPARC and SPARC-Europe, and the CERN Library are organising the
third OAI workshop at CERN, Geneva (Switzerland) on 12-14 February 2004.


Please see further details and book online at 
<A HREF="http://info.web.cern.ch/info/OAIP/">http://info.web.cern.ch/info/OAIP/</A> 

The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was founded in 2000 to bring the
benefits of open archives-compliant software to the research community
and launch an international network of institutional repositories. 

Since OAI's founding, there have been many successful applications of
the technology, and a simultaneous, widespread understanding that open
archives technology is the foundation for the future of research. In the
field of scholarly communication there has also been a remarkable
evolution: open access journals have achieved respectability through the
activities of BioMed Central and PLoS and the number of such journals is
rising; scholarly societies are becoming interested in the open access
model, and we have seen some society publishers adopt the open access
model. The foremost granting agencies in the U.S. and the U.K. have both
issued statements supporting open access. 

However, libraries have not yet reaped large benefits from the OAI's
success. 

Through publishers' &quot;big deals,&quot; more commercial journal titles than
ever before are accessible, and library budgets are tightly bound to
them in long-term contracts. Library customers are growing accustomed to
the enormous comfort offered by the databases of those publishers and,
as a consequence, switching to alternative models for scientific
communication has become less and less acceptable. We want to change
this. 

The third CERN workshop will bring together librarians and information
specialists, publishers, scientists and university managers who want to
bring the benefits of open archives technology and open access
publishing to libraries. The conference's action-focused agenda will
prioritize initiatives to be undertaken, in order to increase the impact
of OAI on the process of scientific publishing.
