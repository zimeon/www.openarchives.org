<PRE>Re:set descriptions, take a look at the Dublin Core Collection Description 
Application Profile which does include an element for 'logo'.

</I>&gt;<i>I'm not sure if it was clear from my message, that the white paper I
</I>&gt;<i>pointed to was a discussion paper written 2 years ago to begin discussions
</I>&gt;<i>on the degree to which version 2 of the protocol should formalize or guide
</I>&gt;<i>the use of sets.  The issues at the bottom were discussed and what you see
</I>&gt;<i>in the current protocol is what came out of those discussion.  What was
</I>&gt;<i>implemented in version 2 was the ability to use any XML Schema for set
</I>&gt;<i>description.  This would allow communities to establish their own
</I>&gt;<i>practices.  And XML Schemas developed for one community might be adopted
</I>&gt;<i>in others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I can see reason for wanting branding at the set level, but I have been
</I>&gt;<i>more interested in getting rich set descriptions out there to see if
</I>&gt;<i>harvesters found them useful [the answer from the harvesters I care about
</I>&gt;<i>has been &quot;yes&quot;].  I used Dublin Core because it was there.  If someone
</I>&gt;<i>else wanted to create a schema that added a branding element, I would use
</I>&gt;<i>it.  It's not clear to me that my repository branding icon is actually
</I>&gt;<i>being used anywhere, and so this hasn't been top of my priority list.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; p.s. is LCSH international? is it used in South Africa? Ethiopia?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No. LCSH is not international.  It is used in many places, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; policies and practices do not include an attempt to serve international
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs (to judge from discussions of the problem issues that required
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; policy decisions, when I had a detail to the part of LC that maintains
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LCSH).  LCSH is also enormous.  I remember an analysis in the fairly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; early
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; days of OAI by Old Dominion that implied that LC didn't use controlled
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vocabulary in its subject terms in OAI records, because of the number of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distinct terms in our records.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Back to sets in OAI.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree that discussion about what is useful for harvesters is valuable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If there is good evidence that certain practices for sets work for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certain categories of service providers, data providers who care
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about whether or how their stuff appears in those particular services
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may take steps to use sets that aren't related to internal processes or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organization.  Absent any such evidence, you can hardly blame them for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doing what is easy.  And for many, there are no resources to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything more than a simple technical transformation from internal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; records.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For what it's worth, the issue of how early implementer were using sets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was looked at in the technical discussions that led to the development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version 2 of OAI-PMH.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Out of 49 repositories, 39 are using sets. Of these 13 appear to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; partition their collection by subject area, 13 by genre, and 9 by source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of records.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; See the table at the end of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/oai/collection-description/wh">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/oai/collection-description/wh</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; itepaper.html
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for more detail.  [Thanks to Andy Powell for being a pack-rat and still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having the file at the URL I found by mining my e-mail!]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not clear that anyone was using sets to provide fine-grained
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subject
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; breakdowns (which some repositories now are).  There may be communities
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interest where that is useful and feasible, but in the cultural heritage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; area (personal papers, digitized, manuscripts, photographs, museum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; artifacts, etc.) there is plenty of evidence that agreement on &quot;topical&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; terminology and rules for application across heterogeneous domains is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; neither feasible, nor indeed helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For the content in the LCOA1 repository, LC has more interest in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sets that are useful for Kat Hagedorn (OAIster) and Sara Shreeves (UIUC)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and other service providers that focus on building services that are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likely to serve people to whom our digitized historical content is of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interest.  My sense is that a set breakdown that suits those service
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -providers (and this sort of content) would be very different from a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; breakdown that is useful for current scientific scholarly communication.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps providers of production services can indicate if this list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a useful forum for discussing what practices in relation to sets make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sense to them.  They may be having discussions within a community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other lists or meetings.
