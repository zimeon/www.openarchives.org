<PRE>&gt;<i> I suppose you also generate the different formats on the fly rather than
</I>&gt;<i> actually store persistent versions, right? 
</I>
we precompute the metadata portion of the OAI response for all
metadata formats we support. we generate the rest of the response,
including the datestamp, on the fly from a record in our
database. this record also contains a pointer to the precomputed
portion.

&gt;<i> I assume that, for each item, you only persist record datestamps for
</I>&gt;<i> each format you disseminate, 
</I>
yes.

&gt;<i> along with a master record datestamp (like Library of Congress), is
</I>&gt;<i> this correct?
</I>
no, but only because we don't disseminate master records via
OAI. however, we know what that datestamp would be, so if it were ever
to change, then ...

&gt;<i> And also that every time you actually change the item/master-record
</I>&gt;<i> -- in the day-to-day operation of your repository -- you also update
</I>&gt;<i> all the datestamps you are maintain.
</I>
yes.

&gt;<i> In any case, you're doing this to potentially avoid SPs having to repeat a
</I>&gt;<i> historical harvest of records which have not actually changed but appear to
</I>&gt;<i> have because a mapping of the master record onto another format -- say a
</I>&gt;<i> newly adopted format of no relevance to old SPs -- has. Is this also
</I>&gt;<i> correct? 
</I>
if we were to add a new format, the records for the new format would
get a datestamp more recent than that for any of our other formats,
because we'd want the harvesters to pick them up. the records for the
old formats would not receive a new datestamp, because nothing about
them would have changed.

&gt;<i> &gt;From a repository-centric perspective, this seems to me quite a service you
</I>&gt;<i> do to SPs and the OAI-PMH. I find it interesting for it shows that, even
</I>&gt;<i> within the OAI-PMH, some service costs may be absorbed by DPs rather than
</I>&gt;<i> SPs. 
</I>
you betcha, as we like to say in the midwest. :-)
