I think the abstraction is useful, but I am possibly interested in OAI
in other domains than digitial libraries, so registration might be
a bit more problematic (that is, they might not want to register
with a central service).

&gt;<i> Note that the
</I>&gt;<i> schema says:
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;!-- * A &quot;repositoryIdentifier&quot; that is a unique identifier for a --&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;!-- e.g. arXiv, VTETD. --&gt;
</I>
If you allowed '.' in the name then sites (and maybe '-'?), then you could
at least use domain names. oai:mds.rmit.edu.au:1234. It would not be
mandated, but people would be reasonably confident of having a unique
name without collision. They can always tack something on the start
if they have to repositories on one site. But I am really suggesting
this as something a site could choose to do if it does not want to
go to the global registry.

Digitial Libraries might want to keep OAI in-house. The idea of central
registries just seems a pain if the protocol ever took off. Reusing
domain names registry processes would be an easy 'convention' to 
follow without having to go to the extreme of full URLs.

&gt;<i> Note also that OAI-PMH does not mandate this scheme and not all registered
</I>&gt;<i> repositories have chosen to use it.
</I>
Yes, I noticed 'mit.ethese', 'UKOLN-ejournals', and 'NSDL-DEV-CU'.
Should I then fail to harvest these sites? :-)
