The standard way to say 'I do not implement sets' is a to list no
sets in the ListSets response.

no setSpec =&gt; universal set =&gt; all records

Consider two cases where a harvester might want to use sets:

1) to harvest part of a repository. This requires prior (outside the
protocol) knowledge of the set structure and hence the set or sets to be
harvested cannot be determined automatically.

2) to mirror/harvest the whole repository including the set structure. In
v1.1 it is necessary for a harvester to harvest from all sets and from the
universal set (no setSpec) to be able to deduce the set structure. In v2
all records will include set membership information so it will be
only be necessary to harvest the universal set.

Cheers,
Simeon
