If a goal of OAI is to keep it simple and not change radically (which
I can appreciate), then I would revert to my simpler proposed extension
which is to allow a server to return an optional addtional date/time in
ListRecords/ListIdentifiers responses indicating that &quot;the client can
use this as a 'from' date to resume if the response token times out&quot;.

For the very simple implementations (or small data volume sites), the
server just omits this value.

For more sophisticated implementations with a database engine behind
the scenes (for example, so it can easly sort the records), then for
each packet it can say &quot;I am guaranteeing to at least have returned
everything up to this date&quot;. This allows a harvester client hitting a
large site for a first time to not have to start again from scratch if
something goes wrong (resumption token time out etc). Date resolution
is fine here (getting some entries a second time is not the problem -
the problem is starting again from the very beginning).

My first attempt at a client harvester for example took about a day to
go to several sites and download everything. It hung several times
(unknown network issues), meaning I had to restart it on some large
sites from scratch. Many other sites it failed for (I can post a list
if people are interested - many seemed to only support GET and not POST).
