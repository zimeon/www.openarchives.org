</I>
I'm pretty new to OAI, but my use of it has primarily been as a protocol
layer for my project's cataloging and webcrawling interface for standards
like dublin-core or dublin-core extended and MARC.  Enough of that though.
Since I use it as a protocol, I would rather not expect it to deliver
anything else (like standard error messages or handling through an API);
however, it would be very nice to see those things.

I noticed a few postings back there was talk of a skeleton or base framework
for implementing OAI. Whatever did happen to that, I wonder?

</I>&gt;<i> each other's servers to see if the results are correct. This may
</I>&gt;<i> be out of scope for OAI - it depends on the scale you want to achieve
</I>&gt;<i> for OAI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, my personal current interest in OAI is not for digital
</I>&gt;<i> libraries. I see that it has potential for any site with metadata
</I>&gt;<i> to reduce their traffic from web crawlers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know what OAI 2.0 is going to be like. If it is XML request
</I>&gt;<i> and response packets (as distinct from HTTP variables and XML responses)
</I>&gt;<i> then you can easily come up with 'doing OAI with SOAP' documents.
</I>&gt;<i> It might not be the ideal way to do it, but SOAP supports the concept
</I>&gt;<i> of document/literal encoding where XML can be (almost!!) verbatim
</I>&gt;<i> dropped in wrapper SOAP elements. Basically there would be a mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> to get it more widely noticed.

</I>&gt;<i> ps: I have done another pass over various sites using POST having fixed
</I>&gt;<i> bugs in my client. Things worked better. Full results are at

</I>&gt;<i> Summary of failures (remember, bugs may be my client!):

</I>&gt;<i>     XML parse errors: aim25, anlc, cogprints, NSDL-DEV-CU, SUUB
