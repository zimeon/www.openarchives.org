<PRE>[Admin point first: Can we stop this duplicate posting to oai-general? 
The description of oai-general is &quot;The OAI list will keep you informed 
about OAI-related activities.&quot; I don't think these discussions fall 
within that.]


My main objection to including an option for harvesters to specify the
maximum number of records they wish to get in a reply is that this will
force ALL repositories to implement resumptionTokens.  Currently, small
repsotiories (say a few thousand records) can happily ignore that part of
the spec.

One of the primary objectives of OAI is to provide a low barrier to
adoption, particularly on the repository side. I therefore think that
requiring this would go against our objectives, even if it is cleaner in
some ways.

Cheers,
Simeon.
