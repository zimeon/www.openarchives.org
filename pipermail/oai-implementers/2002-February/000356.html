Are resumptionTokens therefore guaranteed to be different for each
chunk? (I cannot find that in the spec). I thought OAI allowed a
server to reuse the same resumptionToken for an original request
and followup requests. That is, the resumption token could identify
an original request, but not which incomplete-list of records from
that request to return.

If OAI does not guarantee a distinct resumption token per request,
then its not safe to use them more than once. If a unique token is
guaranteed per request, then yes, I guess they could be used to
recover (if you attempt recovery immediately - before the expiry
on the token runs out).

Are resumptionToken's implicitly assumed to be different for each
incomplete-sublist of a complete-list?

Thanks,
Alan
