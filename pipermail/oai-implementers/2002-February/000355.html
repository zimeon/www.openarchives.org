From our experience in Arc I agree that 100~1000 records is good. &quot;&gt;&gt;1000&quot;
may bring about significant memory issues considering XML parsing
overhead.

I never noticed &quot;time-out&quot; problem, maybe because our harvester do a
continuous harvesting, or there is no special error code for timeout in
OAI-PMH?

</I>
I think resumptionToken is current OAI's answer to this problem.

In current implementation, whenever a network failure happends, the
harvester may restart from the last successful &quot;resumptionToken&quot;, if it's
lucky and the &quot;resumptionToken&quot; is still valid, everything is fine.
Otherwise it may have to harvest everything again. Of course, the
harvester may choose to harvest by date/set, it certainly will save the
finished part.

And a data provider may keep a &quot;resumptionToken&quot; always valid by  encoding
queries like we discussed in previous emails.
