A client can request elements 21-30 of a list, and get a response.
That might be the very first request from that client. Or the first
request after the server reboots. It could even go to a replica of
the server. No resumption token is needed. Calculate the list, and 
return that portion of it.

Here is a URL to get hits 21-30 about &quot;face on mars&quot; from the NASA
search engine. No need to fetch hits 1-20 and get a resumption token.
You can edit the &quot;st&quot; variable to change the start hit.

</I>
A request for all changes between two dates in the past should always get 
the same answer, so stateless harvesting should work. A half-open request, 
that is &quot;until now&quot;, will have time-varying results. If harvesters always
make requests with both from and until, and make sure that the until date
is not in the future, then stateless harvesting is safe.

There should be some way to get the current time at the repository.
Clock skew will cause nasty problems in time-based harvesting. The only
safe solution is to always use the clock at the server, and to require
that it is non-decreasing.
