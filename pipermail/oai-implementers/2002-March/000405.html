<PRE>actually, the way I see it is the protocol should not be complicated with
additional tokens and such to enforce what ETDCat (and similiarly
large-sized DPs) should do:

1.  partition their collection into sets
2.  use stateless (or very long lived) resumptionTokens

in 2.0, resumptionTokens will have optional attributes, including
&quot;expirationDate&quot;, so this will take the guess work out of knowing how long
a resumptionToken will be valid.

IMO, introducing an optional restartToken is no different (from an
implementer's point of view) than making the resumptionToken last a long
time.  

at some point, you (as a harvester) are simply at the mercy of the
repository.  new features in the protocol won't change that.

regards,

Michael

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> He also told me that there were no sets. So basically, its all

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this has happened already, I think its likely to occur again.
</I>&gt;<i> (That is, one very large database all with the same time stamp.)
</I>&gt;<i> So any comments about having a single large collection like this
</I>&gt;<i> is beside the point. The point is OAI does not handle it well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I would like to resurrect the discussion again if people don't
</I>&gt;<i> mind on how to do support restarts. My understanding of the general
</I>&gt;<i> feeling so far is
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Mandating support is not going to be acceptable
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Mandating format of resumption tokens is not going to be acceptable
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (3) Mandating resumption tokens be long lifed (eg: can try again the
</I>&gt;<i>     following day) is not acceptable
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (4) In fact, mandating that resumption tokens be unique (allowing
</I>&gt;<i>     a token to be reused twice in quick succession to get the same
</I>&gt;<i>     data) is not acceptable
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So any proposal needs to be optionally supported.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Question time:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone else think that this is a major hole in OAI? I personally
</I>&gt;<i> do. After trying to crawl sites, things go wrong. The larger the site,
</I>&gt;<i> the greater the probability that something will go wrong. The larger
</I>&gt;<i> the site, the greater the pain of starting all over again. I do not
</I>&gt;<i> think it is practical for anyone to harvest ETDCat if is really got
</I>&gt;<i> 4,000,000 records. Any fault, and start downloading that 4gb again!
</I>&gt;<i> So I feel strongly on this one. In fact, I think this is the most
</I>&gt;<i> major problem OAI has.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do people think its better to reuse resumption tokens for this purpose,
</I>&gt;<i> or introduce a different sort of token? ETDCat for example I think
</I>&gt;<i> allocates a session id in resumption tokens, meaning they cannot
</I>&gt;<i> be reused when the session times out in the server (similar semantics
</I>&gt;<i> anyway). This is a reasonable implementation decision to make.
</I>&gt;<i> So maybe its better for servers to return an additional token,
</I>&gt;<i> which is a &lt;restartToken&gt; which means a client can instead of
</I>&gt;<i> specifying from= and to= again, specify restartToken= instead where
</I>&gt;<i> the server then automatically works out whatever other parameters
</I>&gt;<i> it needs, creates a new session etc internally. The new 'session'
</I>&gt;<i> (ListXXX verb) then can use resumptionTokens to manage that new
</I>&gt;<i> transfer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is for a &lt;restartToken&gt; to be long lifed. It may be less
</I>&gt;<i> efficient to use than a resumptionToken, but its only purpose is
</I>&gt;<i> if the client fails the download. If a server does not support
</I>&gt;<i> restartToken, it simply never returns one. Large collections *should*
</I>&gt;<i> support restartTokens.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For my harvester, I can then remember (to disk) the restartToken for
</I>&gt;<i> every packet I get back, allowing me to recover much more easily
</I>&gt;<i> if anything crashes. If restartToken's are too hard for someone
</I>&gt;<i> to implement, then they don't. If you have a large data collection
</I>&gt;<i> on the other hand, to reduce network load, I think its probably worth
</I>&gt;<i> the extra effort of supporting restartTokens.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any comments? Better suggesions?
