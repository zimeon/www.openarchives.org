This is not quite what I meant. Its more if my resumption token is
just a result set name and the DP remembers where the transfer is
up to, the reusing the same token would get the next N records.
The current spec allows this.

I think OAI 2.0 should allow a DP to advertise (via Identify?) that
it resumptionToken's can be reused (are idempotent) to retry.
That would satisfy me.

&gt;<i> &gt; There is a difference, but is the difference worth the complexity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the protocol? That is a different question.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll rephrase my answer:  the repository can implement it so there is no
</I>&gt;<i> difference.
</I>
I agree that a DP can implement (idempotent resumption tokens), but how
does a harvester know that the DP has implemented it? Either OAI 2.0
must mandate it (possibly overly restrictive for smaller repositories),
or DP's must be able advertise it in a standard way, such as in the
Identify response.

So not much needs to be done, but something does need to be done.
The 1.1 spec at present is not enough.

&gt;<i> this is an artifact of your implementation... write the result set out to
</I>&gt;<i> disk and set the expirationDate to a few days.  add a reasonable response
</I>&gt;<i> caching algorithm, and you could end up with a huge performance
</I>&gt;<i> win.  Depending on the DP accession rate, harvesting patterns, etc., your
</I>&gt;<i> mileage could vary, but I suspect it would be very good.
</I>
I would never write the result set out to disk. For a very large
result set (eg: 10,000,000 records), I would have to fetch all the
records (lots of disk accesses) get their OAI-id's, then start
transferring. Then how long to keep the temporary file around for?
How many people might be doing transfers at the same time?
(A Z39.50 result set is not a client side data structure, but
a server side data structure by the way.)

But Liu had a good solution - just store both what I called resumptionToken
and restartToken in the resumptionToken. Ie: the result set name and
query. If the result set has timed out, use the query part and build
it up again. Its up to me to get it correct. I personally would
have problems with cursors and list sizes (I would not support them
because if I redid the query, the result set size may change and
so both the size and cursor would be invalidated). But I can munge
my own DP implementation stuff in there to do something pretty similar
(my own internal concept of a 'cursor').

&gt;<i> 2.0 will already have more machine processable information in the Identify
</I>&gt;<i> response.  I'm not sure there is a good way around it, and since that
</I>&gt;<i> door is already open, if you want to provide hints about how your
</I>&gt;<i> resumptionTokens are used/implemented, that's surely ok.
</I>
Ok, then I think advertise a little more about idempotency of
resumptionToken's and everything is fine. Implementors for large
repositories should try to have long time-to-live for resumption
tokens, but no protocol change is required.

&gt;<i> but if their resumptionTokens had a long life, and were idempotent within
</I>&gt;<i> that lifetime you would not have to start from scratch.  2.0 will allow
</I>&gt;<i> the specification of the former, and we should probably discuss the latter
</I>&gt;<i> some more.
</I>
Agreed. The simplest solution is (as above) to allow a server to advertise
its resumptionToken's are idempotent.

&gt;<i> you better build your system after all this!  ;-)
</I>
*-)

One problem is I dont have any data to export - only data that other
people have made available. The other problem relates to number of
hours in the day. I still want to put my harvested collection up
for public access to if I can scrounge up the disk space.

&gt;<i> seriously, you bring up a lot of good points.  a lot of this exchange
</I>&gt;<i> should probably be reflected in the implementation guide that will
</I>&gt;<i> accompany the protocol doc.
</I>
I think the conclusions, such as 'advertise idempontency, and make resumption
tokens long lifed to handle where a harvester hits a problem and waits
for a humam to try and keep going' are worth documenting, not the rest.
There are always the mail archives.
