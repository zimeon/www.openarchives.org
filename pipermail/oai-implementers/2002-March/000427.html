I don't think the protocol is idempotent. If a record is changed, it's
datestamp should be updated too, so a query to past (from-&gt;until) may be 
quite different. And the old record should not be kept. (Except in special
case like CVS, you will give it another OAI id, that's a different problem
however.)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The objective, as I understand, is to reach a consistent view for
different harvesters, based on frequent fresh harvesting. Let's assume
two harvesters, say H1 and H2. Like your case, we have a record X inserted
in May and updated in July. If H1 starts harvesting in April, it will get
an old version of your record in May, but if H1 is doing a regular fresh
harvesting, it will pickup the changes sometimes in  July; and H2 starts
harvesting in Aug, it will get a new version of X and never know what's
happended to X before. By this way H1 and H2 will have the same view of
the repository.

</I>&gt;<i> be idempotent. This was my current understanding from old postings on

</I>&gt;<i> then I will need to rethink how I implement my harvester (which might
</I>&gt;<i> turn into an aggregator). Currently I keep the most recent record
</I>&gt;<i> version and throw away old versions (by doing updates on the old
</I>&gt;<i> record).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doing a search service would also be different because I doubt people
</I>&gt;<i> want to do a search and find the old version of the record.
