<PRE>Alan,

The reason you get just 60k records from arXiv is probably linked with the
problem of specifying a date too early for my implementation to understand
correctly (now fixed, someone else pointed it out last week too). I don't
know about ways to verify successful harvesting but I would suggest that
doing a harvest with no 'from' and 'until' parameters is more robust than
picking an arbitrary 'from' date.

Cheers,
Simeon.
