<PRE>Alan,

I have proposed the introduction of a ListFriends verb, which was supposed to
do exactly what you describe, for inclusion in version 2.0 of the OAI-PMH.  I
felt it would have been an interesting addition to the spec because it
supported service providers in locating data poviders in a non-centralised
manner.    However, the OAI-Tech committee has decided not to pursue it,
mainly because we could not figure out what the incentives would be for a
repository to do the additional work of keeping a list of &quot;befriended&quot; repos.

I wrote a white paper on it, in October 2001.  If you are interested please
send me a private mail.

greetings

&gt;<i> Another mailing list I am on related to Z39.50 is talking about the
</I>&gt;<i> concept of &quot;Friends and Neighbours&quot;. It may be a bit early for
</I>&gt;<i> OAI (not that many sites yet!), but the basic idea is that sites
</I>&gt;<i> keep track of what other sites they know of. That way, there does
</I>&gt;<i> not need to be a central registry as such. Theoretically someone
</I>&gt;<i> can write a crawler, start at one site, find out what other
</I>&gt;<i> sites it knows of, and work its way on from there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This allows major institutions with a real commitment to OAI to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain a list of other sites under their juristiction, with links
</I>&gt;<i> off to other places where similar lists are kept.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One way this could be done in OAI for example is to define a new
</I>&gt;<i> XML schema for information on repositories. You then ask your first
</I>&gt;<i> site (you have to be given a starting point) what sites it knows of.
</I>&gt;<i> It will probably return itself (not mandatory for simple data provider
</I>&gt;<i> implementations), but it may return other sites it knows of.
</I>&gt;<i> The crawler can then go off and ask those sites what sites they know
</I>&gt;<i> of, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two things are needed to achieve this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) A definition of a new schema describing a OAI site. Probably only
</I>&gt;<i>     needs repository id, BaseURL, and protocol version. The Identify
</I>&gt;<i>     verb can be used on the site to get other information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (2) One or more of the data provider software implementors to support
</I>&gt;<i>     more than one record syntax (ie, not only dublin core).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am assuming that in OAI if you ask for data in a particular record
</I>&gt;<i> schema, you will only get records that were in that syntax.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seemed a better way of getting an up to date list of sites compared
</I>&gt;<i> to the current ListFriends.pl XML document at the www.openarchives.org
</I>&gt;<i> site. It allows the OAI protocol to maintain lists of OAI sites
</I>&gt;<i> in a distributed way. Aggregators just aggregate OAI site records
</I>&gt;<i> like any other record they would aggregate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought it was a cute idea.
