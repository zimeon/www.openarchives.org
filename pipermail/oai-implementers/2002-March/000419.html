*If* restartToken was introduced, it would be idempotent-ish. Its whole
purpose would be to allow it to be reissued and old results come back.
I would define it as &quot;returning all of the records not returned so
far in the current transfer, possibly including other records that
have already been transferred&quot;.

&gt;<i> 2) If it is legal to re-use, should we introduce a restartToken concept?

I agree the concensus is to stick to resumptionToken's. That's fine.
Just pushing restartToken to see what problems/issues arrise.

I would therefore instead propose that there be a standard way in
the Identify response to say 'resumptionToken's are idempotent'
and also 'resumptionToken's can be rerequested' in case of network
failure. DP implementors *should* also try to make them long lifed
(days to weeks) for large repositories.

&gt;<i> In your case, I could imagine it can be done by current OAI 
</I>&gt;<i> resumptionToken: assume the proposed tokens in your suggestion are called
</I>&gt;<i> alan_restartToken and  alan_resumptionToken respectively. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> oai_resumptionToken=alan_restartToken + alan_resumptionToken
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So data provider (DP) can always parse the oai_resumptionToken, in most
</I>&gt;<i> case, the session is valid and DP just uses alan_resumptionToken; if
</I>&gt;<i> anything goes wrong, DP need redo the query, DP have the freedom to use
</I>&gt;<i> the alan_restartToken. The harvester should not know what happens behind
</I>&gt;<i> the scene. At this scenario, the time-to-live could be month, year ;-)
</I>
That works. I can use it with my Z39.50 result set/query. If the
result set is still around, reuse it. If it has timed out, redo the
query. I would not be able to return the number of records (when
redoing the query, the number might change), but overall things
would work.
