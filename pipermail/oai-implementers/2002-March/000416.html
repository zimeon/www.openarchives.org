I am sorry, but I agree with other's here that sets are not the
solution. How are the sets going to be created? Are they going
to have any semantics (or just 1,000 records per set)? What if I
do want semantics for my sets, but one set does have a 1,000,000
records? What happens when people start creating even bigger
collections? Etc. I think sets can be useful, but I would not
*rely* on them as solving the problem.

I am going to play devil's advocate a bit here - I think its worth
teasing out arguments a bit more to make sure they are solid.

There is a difference, but is the difference worth the complexity
to the protocol? That is a different question.

For example, if I was going to build a data supplier implementation
(I am actually thinking about how it would be done), then I would
layer it on top of Z39.50 - because that is what our database server
uses. Z39.50 has a result set concept. So I would do a search,
then the resumptionToken would be the result set name. If I had
to make resumptionTokens unique (not currently required I believe),
then I would add the offset into the result set. Since result
sets are stored in the server, I might use a timeout of 10 minutes,
maybe an hour, certainly not a few days. Each result set uses up
memory in the server! Note that because I have a Z39.50 result,
I don't need to worry about updates of data in the server.
My result set won't change in size during the transfer, so I can
implement idempotent resumptionTokens easily.

So how to support restarting if something goes wrong? Well, I could
implement a restartToken which encoded the original request and
the OAI record identifier I was up to. Note, I would not store the
result set index. I have to redo the query, the database may have
changed, so the old index is no longer guaranteed to be correct.
(I would sort the result sets in the server to make my implementation
easy). My restart query would be the old from/until stuff, plus an
addtional 'id &gt;= id-from-restartToken' so the new result set would
be smaller.

How long would my restartToken be valid for? I could say months
or years. How long would my resumptionToken be valid for? minutes
or hours, not days. Remember that if a transfer fails, my data
provider code is not sure how long before (or if) the client is
going to retry. If the harvester says 'help! I need human
intervension', then the delay could be significant.

So my *personal* feeling is restartToken's should have a life in
terms of at least a week. Certainly multiple days. I think this
might be too much of a restriction on resumption tokens.


Some other points worth noting:

* If a server does support long term resumption tokens, then they
  can return exactly the same string for both resumption tokens
  and restart tokens. So implementation is not that much harder.

* It is reasonable for a request using a restart token to return
  a different set of records (due to database updates) than the
  old request. It is also reasonable for a server not to return
  a restart token for every response - it could, for example,
  return a restart token every time the day or year changes in
  returned records (if the implementation returns them in order)
  allowing the harvester to avoid doing *all* the work again,
  even if some effort is repeated. (ie: more flexibility).

* Is enhancing the Identify verb response (in a standard way) a
  good model to move to? It is a real option, and a reasonable one.
  But so far OAI has not required harvesters to do this sort of
  look into what the server provides. Do people want to start now?
  (Phylisophical question here worth asking.) Using restartToken
  does not require usage of examining Identify responses.

* For small servers, they do not have to implement restartToken at
  all. In that case, harvesters just redo the whole request.
  So this is not mandatory additional code to write.

* For people who have written code to implement a data provider,
  how much of a burden is there for resumptionToken's to be valid
  for a long period of time? (eg: a week). Would a separate
  restartToken be any use?

* For data provider programmers again, if the data provider server
  goes down (eg: shut down nightly for backups or something), will
  it be easy to make resumption tokens survive across such events?

* Has OAI 2.0 decreed that resumptionToken's can be reused? (Idempotent)
  If not, then they cannot be used to recover - unless again something
  is added to Identify for harvesters to say 'oh, I can try a reload'.


Taking my horns off for a moment, I also agree that keeping the protocol
simple is a very good thing.

But I am not (yet) convinced (oh dear, those horns don't come off that
easily do they &gt;;^) that that forcing resumptionTokens to have a longer
life is actually simplifying the job of implementors. And I don't think
short life resumptionTokens (less than a few days at least) will solve
the restart problem.  Semantically, to me resumptionToken's are used as
a protocol mechanism to link multiple packets into a single request.
RestartTokens are used to recover after a failure by starting a
completely new request.

&gt;<i> at some point, you (as a harvester) are simply at the mercy of the
</I>&gt;<i> repository.  new features in the protocol won't change that.
</I>
That is true, but that does not mean to me that the protocol cannot
be improved to make the protocol more robust. With OAI as it is,
I am not going to try and crawl ETDCat any more. Even with more
precise date stamps (lets say every ETDCat record has a different
stamp), because results are not guaranteed to come back in sorted
order, I cannot restart using from=. I must start again from scratch.

I think the real question is will data provider implementers be
happy with resumptonToken's lasting for a week. For me *personally*,
it will be easier having two separate tokens. But I think its wrong
to design the protocol around my intended implementation (which does
not even - and may never - exist! :-)
