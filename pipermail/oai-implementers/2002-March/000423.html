If a request has two time bounds, both in the past, then the protocol
should be idempotent. The protocol would need to outlaw back-dated
changes (put in this record today and date it yesterday).

With only a beginning bound, the protocol is not idempotent.
Requests with &quot;until now&quot; or &quot;until next week&quot; have other problems,
like clock skew. It is better to get the current server time, then
use that.

&gt;<i> if we update a record, its datestamp would cause it to move out of
</I>&gt;<i> range of a from/until specification. is this the only case where
</I>&gt;<i> the weaker condition fails ? if so, what if we ditch the until parameter ?
</I>
Requiring &quot;until&quot; might be a better path to statelessness. If a
record falls outside the bounds, that isn't a tragedy. It will be
picked up on the next harvest. There is always a window where
the read is before the write. The only question is how big.

As for EDTcat, this protocol needs a set of use cases. Then we can
separate kinds of problems: the protocol doesn't meet its intended
uses, or the intended uses missed an important case.

If anyone needs mood music for working on this, the Lene Lovich
album &quot;Stateless&quot; has been released on CD.
