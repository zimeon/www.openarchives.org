<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Another mailing list I am on related to Z39.50 is talking about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concept of &quot;Friends and Neighbours&quot;. It may be a bit early for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OAI (not that many sites yet!), but the basic idea is that sites
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keep track of what other sites they know of. That way, there does
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This looks very like the concepts in Peer-to-Peer, especially Gnutella.
</I>&gt;<i> But I am not sure how well it fits in here. In Gnutella/Fasttrack, people
</I>&gt;<i> want to get a music file, they don't care  much about how precise the
</I>&gt;<i> result is, as long as they can get something. But here we may want a
</I>&gt;<i> definite answer, like: how many OAI data providers and what contents they
</I>&gt;<i> share so far?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
not necessarily...  the original purpose of &quot;friends&quot; was that it would
allow a loosely connected set of DPs w/o having to use a central
registery.  sort of like a bunch of http servers that have html pages that
point to each other.  and &quot;friends&quot; is very DP-centric:  DPs get to decide
who to list as their friends.

for example, the NASA DPs might list each other as &quot;friends&quot;, and maybe
some of the other labs &amp; institutes that they share data with (e.g., LANL)
or are affiliated with (e.g., RIACS).  a SP that finds one of these DPs
should be able to get a rough idea of the DPs that cooperate by design,
essentially inferring the &quot;community&quot; of federal research lab DPs.  apply
the standard hubs/authorities, etc. stuff here too.

&quot;ListFriends&quot; did not make it as a verb in OAI 2.0; but perhaps it could
be experimented with using specials sets: &quot;oai_friends&quot; or something
equally mnemonic.  or maybe just a separate metadata format (oai_friends):

<A HREF="http://www.foo.org/oai/?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_friends">http://www.foo.org/oai/?verb=ListRecords&amp;metadataPrefix=oai_friends</A>

its not hard to imagine a simple schema that delineates
who you're pointing to.  

&gt;<i> Another way is to expose the list of data provider in an OAI interface,
</I>&gt;<i> that's what we did in Arc:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/oaisp/servlet/OAI-SP?verb=ListRecords&from=&until=&set=&metadataPrefix=oai_dc">http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/oaisp/servlet/OAI-SP?verb=ListRecords&amp;from=&amp;until=&amp;set=&amp;metadataPrefix=oai_dc</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
yeah, a separate interface is one way to do it too.  

&gt;<i> This might be an easier way to implement a friend/neighbor functions. For
</I>&gt;<i> a data provider, it might support two OAI interface, one for naming
</I>&gt;<i> service, another for real data.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> I agree a strong central control will be helpful, considering somebody

</I>&gt;<i> Of course, that won't prevent any internal use. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
yeah, a quick browse through Arc reveals that  most of the archive names
don't mean much, and there is going to be collision of obvious acronyms /
names.
