This looks very like the concepts in Peer-to-Peer, especially Gnutella.
But I am not sure how well it fits in here. In Gnutella/Fasttrack, people
want to get a music file, they don't care  much about how precise the
result is, as long as they can get something. But here we may want a
definite answer, like: how many OAI data providers and what contents they
share so far?  

Another way is to expose the list of data provider in an OAI interface,
that's what we did in Arc:

<A HREF="http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/oaisp/servlet/OAI-SP?verb=ListRecords&from=&until=&set=&metadataPrefix=oai_dc">http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/oaisp/servlet/OAI-SP?verb=ListRecords&amp;from=&amp;until=&amp;set=&amp;metadataPrefix=oai_dc</A>

This might be an easier way to implement a friend/neighbor functions. For
a data provider, it might support two OAI interface, one for naming
service, another for real data.

I agree a strong central control will be helpful, considering somebody
wants to build a service provider, he really needs a point to start with.
Of course, that won't prevent any internal use.

One incentives will be the peer-2-peer like Kepler ;-), in the scenario of
Kepler, each client is very unstable, so their contents must be cached in
somewhere, it might be in the service provider side, like we did now. Or
it might be distributed to its neighbor or anybody who is more stable or
has better Internet communcation. So it would be helpful if such a list
of &quot;befriended&quot; exists. That's the the approach we are exploring.

Another incentives will be kind of mirror problem like oaia, for one
service provider, it doesn't want to harvest same records multiple times
from different data providers. So one way to identify the duplication is
necessary, I believe that's also where a &quot;befriended&quot; verb will play.
