MOAI Server 1.0 Released

4 May 2009 - Infrae is pleased to announce the first public release of
the MOAI Server. MOAI is a platform that aggregates input from disparate
sources and republishes it via the Open Archive Initiatives protocol for
metadata harvesting. MOAI is built for institutional repositories that
store relational metadata and asset files.

MOAI is open source software, released under a BSD license. For complete
technical information see the MOAI site: http://moai.infrae.com/.

What is the MOAI Server?
------------------------

MOAI is an open access server platform for institutional repositories.
The server aggregates content from disparate sources, transforms it,
stores it in a database, and (re)publishes the content, in one or many
OAI feeds. Each feed has its own configuration.

The server has a flexible system for combining records into sets and
uses these sets in the feed configuration. MOAI also comes with a simple
yet flexible authentication scheme that can easily be customized.
Besides providing authentication for the feeds, the authentication also
controls access to the assets.

MOAI is a standalone system that can be used in combination with any
repository software that comes with an OAI feed such as Fedora Commons,
EPrints or DSpace. It can also be used directly with an SQL database or
just a folder of XML files.

Features
--------

MOAI has a number of features that are not common to most OAI servers.
Besides serving OAI, MOAI can also harvest OAI. MOAI can transform the
incoming feeds. The OAI data can be reconfigured, cached, and further
enriched while it passes through the MOAI Server.

MOAI has the ability to:

     * Harvest data from different kinds of sources
     * Serve many OAI feeds from one MOAI Server, each with their own
       configuration
     * Turn metadata values into OAI sets on the fly, creating new
       collections
     * Use OAI sets to filter records shown in a feed, configurable for
       each feed
     * Work easily with relational data (e.g. if an author changes, the
       publication should also change)
     * Provide simple and robust authentication through integration with
       the Apache webserver
     * Serve assets through Apache while still using configurable
       authentication rules

In the coming period more features will be added and the MOAI product
page updated accordingly.

History
-------

The MOAI software is not young and has been in production use for a
number of years. It started its life under a different name as part of
the software for the RePub repository at Erasmus University Rotterdam in
the Netherlands. The software was built on top of the pyoai component,
an OAI server and client library developed for the university in 2003.
Many of the features that MOAI supports are a direct result of the
experience and excellent feedback from the Erasmus University library team.

In 2008 the Technical University Delft funded a project to refactor and
repackage the OAI server code from the Erasmus repository into a
standalone software package; this became MOAI.
Interaction with other systems and websites

Feeds from MOAI can be picked up by any system or search engine that
understands OAI metadata. If the system is a content management system
and has harvesting capabilities, the feed data can be stored, presented,
and searched within a website. Silva, a powerful CMS for organizations
that manage complex sites, has OAI Pack extensions that provide these
capabilities. The Silva CMS is also an Infrae product, see
http://infrae.com/products/silva.

Download
--------

The MOAI software is available on the PyPi site:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MOAI.

A buildout is the easiest way to install MOAI; read an explanation on
the MOAI documentation site

Hello,

...Houston, we've got a problem: We thought it would be sufficient to
implement *one* baseURL for many repositories we have. Thus we defined a
baeURL with the repositories name as parameter

http://dbs.hab.de/oai/?repository=WDB_OPAC

All parameters (key=value pairs) are added to that base url as
*additional* parameters, concatenated by "&" instead of "?" if they were
the only ones.

Is this really faulty or should harvesters add another way of trying to
get our content? How do others solve the "problem"? mod_rewrite the baseURL?

Best, Torsten

Hi Torsten,

I would consider using the CGI PATHINFO variable instead of using a 
query string to differentiate your repositories.  This is what the OAI 
static gateway protocol uses, where you essentially have one script that 
is servicing multiple repositories.  Your URLs would look like this:

http://dbs.hab.de/oai/WDB_OPAC?verb=OAI_VERB&...

Kind regards,
Tom Habing

Fedora Commons and DSpace Foundation Join Together to Create  
DuraSpace? Organization

Ithaca, NY, Boston, MA --- Fedora Commons and the DSpace Foundation,  
two of the largest providers of open source software for managing and  
providing access to digital content, have announced today that they  
will join their organizations to pursue a common mission.  Jointly,  
they will provide leadership and innovation in open source  
technologies for global communities who manage, preserve, and provide  
access to digital content.

The joined organization, named ?DuraSpace,? will sustain and grow its  
flagship repository platforms - Fedora and DSpace.  DuraSpace will  
also expand its portfolio by offering new technologies and services  
that respond to the dynamic environment of the Web and to new  
requirements from existing and future users.  DuraSpace will focus on  
supporting existing communities and will also engage a larger and more  
diverse group of stakeholders in support of its not-for-profit  
mission.  The organization will be led by an executive team consisting  
of Sandy Payette (Chief Executive Officer), Michele Kimpton (Chief  
Business Officer), and Brad McLean (Chief Technology Officer) and will  
operate out of offices in Ithaca, NY and Cambridge, MA.
?This is a great development,? said Clifford Lynch, Executive Director  
of the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI).  ?It will focus  
resources and talent in a way that should really accelerate progress  
in areas critical to the research, education, and cultural memory  
communities.  The new emphasis on distributed reliable storage  
infrastructure services and their integration with repositories is  
particularly timely. ?

Together Fedora and DSpace make up the largest market share of open  
repositories worldwide, serving over 700 institutions.  These include  
organizations committed to the use of open source software solutions  
for the dissemination and preservation of academic, scientific, and  
cultural digital content.

  ?The joining of DSpace and Fedora Commons is a watershed event for  
libraries, specifically, and higher education, more generally,? said  
James Hilton, CIO of the University of Virginia.  ?Separately, these  
two organizations operated with similar missions and a shared  
commitment to developing and supporting open technologies.  By  
bringing together the technical, financial, and community-based  
resources of the two organizations, their communities gain a robust  
organization focused on solving the many challenges involved in  
storing, curating, and preserving digital data and scholarship,? he  
said.
New Products

DuraSpace will continue to support its existing software platforms,  
DSpace and Fedora, as well as expand its offerings to support the  
needs of global information communities.  The first new technology to  
emerge will be a Web-based service named ?DuraCloud.?  DuraCloud is a  
hosted service that takes advantage of the cost efficiencies of cloud  
storage and cloud computing, while adding value to help ensure  
longevity and re-use of digital content.  The DuraSpace organization  
is developing partnerships with commercial cloud providers who offer  
both storage and computing capabilities.

The DuraCloud service will be run by the DuraSpace organization.  Its  
target audiences are organizations responsible for digital  
preservation and groups creating shared spaces for access and re-use  
of digital content.  DuraCloud will be accessible directly as a Web  
service and also via plug-ins to digital repositories including Fedora  
and DSpace.  The software developed to support the DuraCloud service  
will be made available as open source.  An early release of DuraCloud  
will be available for selected pilot partners in Fall 2009.

Key Benefits of the DuraSpace Organization

DuraSpace will support both DSpace and Fedora by working closely with  
both communities and, when possible, develop synergistic technologies,  
services, and programs that increase interoperability of the two  
platforms.  DuraSpace will also support other open source software  
projects including the Mulgara semantic store, a scalable RDF database.

DuraSpace will pursue a mission that extends beyond these existing  
software platforms.  This broader mission will include developing open  
technologies and services for the communities that have developed  
around these two platforms.  The organization will also reach out to  
new communities who manage, preserve, and provide access to digital  
content.

DuraSpace will amplify the value of each individual organization,  
enabling it to sustain a larger community.  With both organizations  
working in unison, there can be significant economies of scale,  
synergies in developing open technologies and services, and a strong  
position for long-term sustainability.

Learn More about DuraSpace

DuraSpace will be represented at the Fourth Annual International  
Conference on Open Repositories (http://openrepositories.org/).   
Please check the schedule and visit the Fedora Commons and DSpace  
information tables at the conference to learn more.

More information is available at the DuraSpace website (http://duraspace.org/

Message-ID: <C6308FAE.1A59D%t.hammond@nature.com>

Hi:

I've no idea who's responsible for the OAI Data Provider registry [1]. I
wondered if anybody here knew anything about it.

I have tried to register our OAI service at

    http://www.nature.com/oai/request

using the registration page [2] and it validated and said a confirmation
mail would be sent to the server admin. (This was already last Friday.)
Unfortunately the server admin email we chose is our customer services
address (feedback@nature.com) and so far they have not been able to locate
any email from the registration process.

I have tried mailing direct to the contact address
openarchives@openarchives.org but have got no reply.

Any info on how to complete the registration process would be very helpful
as we'd like to get our service publicly registered.

Cheers,

Tony

Hi Tony,

I think you really should arrange it so that the adminEmail gets to
someone who can understand it. Otherwise what will happen if a
harvester has a problem?

Anyway, I did run the validator/registration manually and it seems
there are problems with the use of resumptionTokens:

Request: GET http://www.nature.com/oai/request?verb=ListRecords&amp;metadataPrefix=oai_dc
[FAIL]  A cursor value was supplied with the resumptionToken but it did not have the correct value zero for the first response. The value was '501'.
Got resumptionToken 1242226376658
Request: GET http://www.nature.com/oai/request?verb=ListRecords&amp;resumptionToken=1242226376658
[FAIL]  Response to request using resumptionToken was an error code


Cheers,
Simeon

Thanks, Simeon.

We'll think about the email address problem but basically we would prefer to
expose a single address for all our services and to have any feedback
channelled internally for problem resolution. What that would mean for the
one-time registration process I don't know. There's a presumption that the
admin address is capable of responding - which I'm not sure is necessarily
required.

As for the cursor you're right, we boobed. We had thought that the cursor
was pointing at the first record on the next page (next record in sequence)
rather than the last record on the previous page (i.e. number of records
already seen). We'll fix that directly but it may be some weeks before we
can deploy that patch.

So, I don't know what that means for the registration process. We may have
to wait some weeks and revisit, and then we may still have a problem
interfacing with the automated registration process. Or is there any
possibility of getting this registered now - with some manual intervention?
:)

Cheers,

Tony

Tony,

I'm not sure if you have received your answer yet or not, but there seems to be a warning when validating your Identify query at http://www.openarchives.org/Register/ValidateSite about your including "mailto:" as part of the adminEmail address:

     Request: GET http://www.nature.com/oai/request?verb=Identify

     WARN - stripped mailto: from adminEmail address, this should not be included.


Therefore, you might want to change 

     <adminEmail>mailto:feedback@nature.com</adminEmail>

to

     <adminEmail>feedback@nature.com</adminEmail>

Hope that helps,

Hi Sandra:

We are planning a maintenance release for next month. This will fix the
problem you reported, some incorrectly coded DOI-based links that Andy
Powell noted in a blog comment, and the two bugs discovered by the full
validation test and reported here by Simeon Warner: one minor (affects an
optional parameter) and one more important (concerns resumption token). In
fact most of the changes have already been made and we are coordinating a
schedule for test and deployment.

The more major validation issue has already been dealt with although we are
aiming to implement a more permanent solution in the maintenance release.
The problem arose from developing within a single server environment and
deploying to a cluster server environment. We believe anyway that the
service is functioning correctly now and would be glad to receive any
further feedback.

Cheers,

Tony

To whom it may concern

Good day
My name is Jorgina Paihama, I'm a student at the University of Cape Town
(UCT) in South Africa. I'm doing my masters in Computer Science - Digital
Libraries.
As part of my research I'm doing a study in interoperability protocols, I
would like to find all possible information them. I have read all the
documentation on OAI-PMH/ORE (as I plan to implement a prototype of the
protocol) and I found a lot of useful information and now I would like to
hear form OAI implementers, how was their experience in implementing this
protocol, the general idea, tips, preferred features, unused features,
constrains/limitations if any, basically anything they have to say about
your experience with bothe PMH and ORE. Is there a forum where i can discuss
the implementation process with other members.

The issue of interoperability is new to me and I need all the help I can
get, but obviously there is the time issue because of the deadlines,
therefore I request that you reply to me as soon as possible.


Thank You
Jorgina Paihama
