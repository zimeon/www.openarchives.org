<PRE>SOFTWARE DEVELOPER POSITION AT THE RESEARCH LIBRARY OF THE LOS ALAMOS
NATIONAL LABORATORY

The Research Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory is looking 
for a software developer to support a grant-funded digital library 
research effort.  The open position is limited term, 2 years.

The successful candidate will work on the Digital Library Research and 
Prototyping Team.  That Team operates by assimilating cutting-edge 
concepts from information science, computer science, digital library 
research, as well as web research and practice, and using those concepts 
to rethink various aspects of scholarly communication.  The Team is 
involved in high-profile research projects funded, amongst others, by 
the Library of Congress, the National Science Foundation and the Andrew 
W. Mellon Foundation.

Specifically, the successful candidate will work collaboratively with a 
project team at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Cornell 
University in prototyping and software development in the context of the 
NSF-funded Pathways project that explores scholarly communication as a 
global, cross-repository workflow.  Information on Pathways is available 
at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/pathways/">http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/pathways/</A>&gt;.
