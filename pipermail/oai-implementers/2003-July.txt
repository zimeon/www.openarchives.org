Subject: [OAI-implementers] Community information
Message-ID: <3F02096B.5000302@csufresno.edu>

Does anyone know of any work being done to use OAI to provide Community
Information?  I'm working on a community health information repository 
and am wondering if anyone from the OAI community has done any work in 
this area.  While MARC21 bibliographic data has been mapped in XML, I'm 
not certain if MARC21 Community Information has been mapped in XML or if 
the MARC21/CI data fields have been used in an OAI repository.

Some guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Registration -- how long is it supposed to take?
Message-ID: <3F02C68C.3080204@adelaide.edu.au>

Hi.

I registered a new respository over a week ago, and received confirmation, and 
yet it is still not showing in the respository list at the OAI site.

Is it supposed to take this long, or has something gone wrong?

I've just registered again, but ... doesn't seem right.

Base URL is http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/cgi-bin/OAI-lite.pl

Regards,
Steve

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Net::OAI::Harvester
Message-ID: <20030708174526.GA12383@karma.dancygier.com>

A beta version of a Perl OAI-PMH harvesting library was just uploaded to
CPAN as Net::OAI::Harvester. The idea behind Net::OAI::Harvester is to
provide an object-oriented client interface to the data found in OAI-PMH 
repositories (similar to what LWP::UserAgent does for HTTP). 

More about OAI-PMH can be found here:
     http://www.openarchives.org

And more about Net::OAI::Harvester can be found here:
     http://search.cpan.org/author/ESUMMERS/OAI-Harvester-0.1/

All of the 6 OAI-PMH verbs are supported. As an example here is the code to 
retrieve a particular record from LC as Dublin Core and display the title.

     my $harvester = Net::OAI::Harvester->new(
          baseUrl => 'http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/oai2_0'
     );

     my $record = $harvester->getRecord(
          identifier     => 'oai:lcoa1.loc.gov:loc.gmd/g3764s.pm003250',
	  metadataPrefix => 'oai_dc'
     );

     my $metadata = $record->metadata();
     print "title: ", $metadata->title(), "\n";

Features:

- OAI-PMH responses can often be rather large XML files. Net::OAI::Harvester 
  uses stream based parsing (XML::SAX) and serializes data as Perl objects on 
  disk (using YAML). This serialized data is then made available through
  an iterator interface which means that you keep a relatively low
  memory foot print when doing ListRecords or ListIdentifiers requests.

- Net::OAI::Harvester includes Net::OAI::Record::OAI_DC which is an
  XML::SAX handler for parsing and providing an object oriented
  interface to baseline Dublin Core metadata. It also provides a
  framework for dropping in your own XML::SAX handler if you want to
  parse other types of metadata. The idea is that as people create their
  own handlers they can be easily included in the Net::OAI::Harvester
  distribution.

- If you are interested in the XML itself you can easily get a hold of the 
  temporary file that contains the full XML response, and do what you want 
  with it.

- You can easily can a hold of the error code and message associated with any 
  request.

Caveats:

- Net::OAI::Harvester only supports OAI-PMH v.2.

- No support for compression (yet).

- Needs more documentation, and examples.

- You need to handle resumptionTokens explicitly. This means a call to 
  listRecords() will not go and grab everything, but just the first chunk. 
  However, there is infrastrucutre and methods to easily get at and pass the 
  tokens.

Feedback/comments/testser would be appreciated. If you are at all interested in 
getting involved in the project please write to me directly, or (preferably) 
use perl4lib@perl.org or oai-implementers@oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu.

'In Practice, Good Practice: the Future of Open Archives' - The 4th Open Archives Forum Workshop, 4-5 September 2003, Bath UK.

The 4th Open Archives Forum will take place at UKOLN, University of Bath,
UK, on the 4th and 5th of September. The title of the workshop is: 'In
Practice, Good Practice'. 

The workshop is now taking registrations for this event. Registration can be completed via a page at the 
Open Archives Forum project site at: http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/bath_invitation.php. 
The programme of the workshop is available at: 
http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/bath_programme.php

***

Details:

The event will focus on good practice in the implementation of open
archives. A particular theme of the workshop will be the use of the Open
Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting [OAI-PMH] in the area
of Cultural Heritage. The workshop will also be looking at the use of the
OAI protocol as a way of publishing information about university theses,
and how that might contribute to developing useful content for
institutional (as opposed to subject-based) eprint archives.

The workshop will build on issues discussed during the whole project, and
draw inferences about best practice. These include technical issues,
organisational issues and Intellectual Property Rights. A report on
organisational issues written by a OAForum working group will be
discussed at the workshop. Breakout sessions will offer the opportunity to
discuss issues of practice with others working at the sharp end of
implementation.

There also will be an introduction to one of the project's key
deliverables: an online tutorial which will give guidance to those wishing
to implement a project using the OAI-PMH. This tutorial will be based on
the experience of the successful pre-workshop tutorials held in Lisbon
(2002) and Berlin (2003).

There will be a  poster session to allow  project dissemination, and  time and space for
 networking. Those wishing to submit a poster should contact Sara Hassen (s.hassen@ukoln.ac.uk)

There will be representatives of the Open Archives Initiative 
present at the workshop, as we have had at earlier workshops, 
and there will be other important figures in the open archives world present. 
There will be contribution from LIBER and SPARC on the current status of Open Access. 
A panel session closing the second day of the workshop will offer the opportunity 
to exchange views about the future direction of open archives, and about our experience of the open 
archives approach so far.

The Open Archives Forum is a EU funded project, whose purpose is to explore
the possibilities of the open archives idea in the European context, and to
facilitate access to relevant information. More information can be found on the Open Archives Forum website at: http://www.oaforum.org/

After seeing how short an OAI client could be (our shortest version so far
is 42 lines of Python code), we thought it would be interesting to see how
much code it would take to support a validated OAI repository in Python.  We
now have a version  ( http://purl.oclc.org/hickey/2PageOAI
<http://purl.oclc.org/hickey/2PageOAI> ) that is 105 lines of code and fits
on two pages, including the rather lengthy copyright statement.  It is
released under our open-source license and we are interested in comments and
improvements.  It could be a practical server for static databases with less
than 100,000 records.  Currently only oai_dc is supported, but sets,
resumption tokens, etc. are all there.
 
The program is self-contained, using the basic HTTP server and XML library
that comes with Python.  We've modified the client script so that it creates
a file suitable for input to the repository code.
