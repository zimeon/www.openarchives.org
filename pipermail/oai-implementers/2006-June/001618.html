<PRE>Members of the list may be interested to note that DCMI recently
announced the availability of a document &quot;Expressing Dublin Core
metadata in XML&quot; [1]. This is a working draft which has been circulated
for public comment.

The primary motivation for this work is to provide an XML format which
is based on the DCMI Abstract Model (DCAM) [2], and which provides an
XML serialisation for all of the constructs of the DCAM (or at least for
some well-defined subset). This XML format is referred to in the
document as DC-XML.

The DC-XML format is a different XML format from that specified by the
current DCMI recommendation for expressing DC metadata in XML [3]. That
recommendation pre-dated the developmemt of the DCAM, and was based on
models for a &quot;simple DC metadata record&quot; and a &quot;qualified DC metadata
record&quot;.

Further details are provided in a message to the dc-architecture mailing
list [4]

For OAI-PMH implementers, the following points may be worth noting:

(i) The publication of this draft does not in any way change the nature
or status of the oai_dc XML format defined by the OAI-PMH specification.


(ii) The oai_dc XML format is an implementation of the &quot;simple DC
metadata record&quot; model and of the guidelines for XML encoding described
in [3]. Applications based on that XML format and on that &quot;simple DC
metadata record&quot; model will continue to function.

(iii) It will be possible to specify an algorithmic transformation
between the oai_dc XML format and the DC-XML format (e.g. in the form of
an XSLT stylesheet), so that oai_dc instances can be transformed into
DC-XML instances and made accessible to applications based on DC-XML and
the DCAM.

(iv) Some OAI-PMH implementers have developed XML formats based on the
&quot;qualified DC metadata record&quot; model and on the guidelines for XML
encoding in [3]. Again, applications based on such XML formats and on
that &quot;qualified DC metadata record&quot; model will continue to function. 

(v) Unfortunately, the &quot;qualified DC metadata record&quot; model does not
correspond to a subset of the DCAM. There are constructs in the
&quot;qualified DC metadata record&quot; model that do not have a clear
correspondence in the DCAM.  It is therefore probably not possible to
define a mapping between the constructs of that &quot;qualified DC metadata
record&quot; model and the DCAM. (Note: this was the case before this recent
draft was published).

(vi) Although a general mapping is probably not possible, the developers
of individual metadata formats based on the &quot;qualified DC metadata
record&quot; model _may_ be able to specify a mapping between the way the
constructs of the &quot;qualified DC record model&quot; have been used in the
context of their formats and the DCAM. 

(vii) If such a mapping can be made, then it would be possible to
specify algorithmic transformations (e.g. XSLT) between each of those
XML formats and the DC-XML format, so that instances could be
transformed into DC-XML instances and made accessible to applications
based on DC-XML and on the DCAM, if required. However it seems likely
that such transformations would have to be developed on a
format-by-format basis.

Cheers

Pete
