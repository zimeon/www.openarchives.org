Subject: [OAI-implementers] ListRecords request w/out an until..
Message-ID: <AANLkTimGn9-kzrS7tO9Jc-MbFDLNZRKDE_czUoiuKjti@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm wondering what others are doing when a ListRecords request w/out an
until comes in.  Consider this scenario:

t0 - harvest request (with no until) is initiated
t1 - record 101 is added to the repo
t2 - harvest is finished (it took multiple requests to complete)

Should record 101 be included in the harvest data?  If not, will the client
better issue their next harvest with a from=t0 (a from=t2 would be invalid
because they'd miss out on record 101).

We have implemented both oai-pmh harvesters and providers, so I have to
consider both ends of this.  Here's what I'm thinking...

As a Provider
I will simply lock the repo so that the above scenario can't happen.  If
someone is already harvesting (there exist unexpired resumptionTokens) then
I will not update the repository.

As a Harvester
I will always use the until parameter with the value of the time the harvest
was initially started.

I think this keeps me clear of any problems.  Anyone else have thoughts or
care to share your solutions?

Thanks,
Ben Anderson

Hi Ben,

This is covered in the in section 3.5.1 of the specification:

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#Idempotency

I think your solution for the harvester is the correct one. Provided the 
harvester starts again with from=t0 all changes between t0 and t2 will be 
harvested, irrespective of whether or not they were included in the original 
response (modulo understood problems with items that move between sets for set 
selective requests).

Cheers,
Simeon

Thanks Simeon.  I'm looking over the section you linked to...

Repositories that implement resumptionTokens *must* do so in a manner that
> allows harvesters to resume a sequence of requests for incomplete lists by
> re-issuing a list request with the most recent resumptionToken
>

I'm having a hard time understanding this sentence. What is meant by
"incomplete list"?  What is meant by "re-issuing a list request"?

I was just thinking that my harvester assumption wouldn't work for the given
scenario:

Let's assume a provider that allows for updates during harvests and that
this provider only keeps the most recent updated date (not all update
dates).  If a record was updated before t0 and again after t0 (but before it
was included in the harvest initiated at t0), then the harvester will not
get the record even though it should have.  That's probably a rare case, but
nevertheless bound to happen.  Are there guidelines for the best way to use
an until as a harvester?

Thanks again,
Ben

ugh, sorry - I pushed send too quickly.  The 2 bullet points after the
sentence I quoted clear it up (at least in regards to what the spec
defines).  Seems a little ambiguous, though, doesn't it?  It seems that to
harvest in the most correct way you almost have to know how the provider is
implemented, which kind of defeats the purpose of a spec.  I'm still curious
as to whether there's a de facto standard that most providers are using?

Your question is interesting. I assume this is why our harvester always includes the "until" parameter as well as the "from" date in its ListRecords requests. On the next re-harvest it uses the former "until" date as the new "from" date, and we are assured of getting all records. I thought this was standard, and that accommodating requests that include only a "from" date was not an issue.
