  Your memory is indeed fading.

  The Santa Fe meeting was informed by work of a group of authors:

Herbert Van de Sompel, Thomas Krichel, Michael L. Nelson, Patrick
Hochstenbach, Victor M. Lyapunov, Kurt Maly, Mohammad Zubair, Mohamed
Kholief, Xiaoming Liu, and Heath O'Connell, The UPS Prototype project:
exploring the obstacles in creating across e-print archive end-user
service, Old Dominion University Computer Science TR 2000-01, February
2000.

  This is the full version. There is a censored version of it that
  apeared in D-LIB magazine, but the above is the full version, 
  I still have a copy at

<A HREF="http://openlib.org/home/krichel/papers/upsproto.pdf">http://openlib.org/home/krichel/papers/upsproto.pdf</A>

  The project looked at building a user service uniting
  contents from the following archives: arXiv, CogPrints, NACA,
  NCSTRL, NDLTD and RePEc.

  Out of these NCSTRL is out of business, it was NSF funded, as 
  soon as the funding stopped, it was dropped, bascially. Thus
 
<A HREF="http://dlib.cs.odu.edu/publications.htm">http://dlib.cs.odu.edu/publications.htm</A>

  has a link to the full version, but it's a dead link to
  a server at Cornell where NCSTRL services lived. But 
  all the others are still in business. 

&gt;<i> but who is willing to invest a lot of money and many years on
</I>&gt;<i> redoing an experiment that failed in many instances not too long
</I>&gt;<i> ago?
</I>
  I would be interested in seeing a list of these &quot;many instances&quot;.

  There is indeed a problem of grant-funded digital libraries
  failing when the grant expires. This continues to be a serious
  problem. But I don't think this was the impetus for the OAI
  work.


  Cheers,
