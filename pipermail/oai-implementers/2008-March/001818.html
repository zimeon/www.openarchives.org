<PRE>Hi Oskar,

&gt;<i> To add to this I have also implemented a first (basic) version of a

</I>&gt;<i> an AtomSerializer are implemented (since I feel my knowledge of RDF

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So with this API you could build (or parse exsting) ResourceMaps and

Sounds great.

&gt;<i> I am thinking of releasing it as open-source and have it available on
</I>&gt;<i> Sourceforge. So now my question to all of you is, would anyone be
</I>&gt;<i> interrested in this? To use or perhaps just help out a little and
</I>&gt;<i> give feedback on?
</I>
Consider me interested :) I'd certainly like to take a look at what you
have, and may be able to contribute in some way.

cheers,

Jim
