Subject: [OAI-implementers] Announcing DC Checker
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.53.0310011249470.2383@alexandria.physik.uni-oldenburg.de>

Hello,

I announce DC Checker
(http://harvest.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/dc/dcchecker.php).

It is a simple tool which checks the content of your metadata records
against recommendations by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI).

Additionally it tries to find wrong UTF-8 encodings (with analysis), and
does some additional checks and presents this in a statistic, so you can
easily see how your Data Provider is doing.

Currently it does quite simple checks, but the recommendations are mostly
not very specific anyway. It does some additional checks to ease life for
Service Providers and will create some warnings then.
(sometimes picky, it will create a warning if creative commons license is
not used...)

Feedback is very welcome, whether these checks make sense, or in what way
this tool can be improved.

Greetings, Heinrich

yes.

Harvesters will generally restore the record with the new one that you
provide. Doing so is implied but not explicitly required by the protocol,
however.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Moving records in and out of sets
Message-ID: <20031003102026.B9484@io.mds.rmit.edu.au>

Sorry, I have been too busy (too lazy?) to read the spec carefully, but
someone ask me recently what happens if a harvester uses sets to harvest
a subset of a collection, and then a record moves in and out of that set.
I could not work it out from a quick skim read of what I think are the
relevant sections of the spec.

If a record starts in the set, it will be harvested.

If it then is updated so that it no longer belongs to that set, it
wont be returned in the next harvest - no delete (the record has not
been deleted), no update (it does not match the set), etc.

If the record is then updated (but not put back into the set), it will
not be returned (its not in the set being harvested).

Then if its updated and put back into the set, the harvest should pick
it up again as being updated and in the set.

If it is updated again and removed from the set, then deleted, the harvest
will not pick it up because it was not in that set when it was deleted.

Does the above make sense? Is there something I am missing? Or is it
that records can never change their set membership? (Or is it just
an unfortunate little aspect of OAI that is not a problem often enough
to make it worth worrying about?)

Thanks
Alan

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Experimental OAI Registry at UIUC
Message-ID: <3F85A056.1050402@uiuc.edu>

Hi all,

This is to announce the availability of a new experimental registry of OAI 
providers.  The registry can be found at:

   http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/

The registry was constructed by collecting the baseURLs of all the providers 
we could from various ListFriends.pl sites, Hussein's repository explorer, 
etc., as well as a search tool developed using the Google SOAP API to search 
for possible baseURLs (surprisingly this yielded 30+ new provider sites). 
Once this list of baseURLs was compiled, a crawler harvested select data 
from each provider, such as Identify, ListSets, ListMetadataFormats, as well 
as a collection of sample records, and record counts for each combination of 
set and metadata format (if possible).  The crawler also traversed to 
baseURLs found in friends containers or via the provenance container from 
sample records.  This resulted in a list of about 340 OAI providers which 
are able to respond, plus about 90 providers which seem to be down.  Many of 
these are versions of the same provider using different versions of the 
protocol, still this list is about twice as big as any other list I've come 
across.

Plus, it is searchable, which was my primary goal, to make it easier to find 
relevant OAI providers.  Essentially I have constructed a full-text index on 
each repository's Identify, ListSets, ListMetdataFormats, and a collection 
of sample records.

I have also done some analysis and made various reports available, such as 
repositories which support compression, a count of the most frequently 
occurring top-level domains, etc.  Check out the "graph of friends" showing 
a graphical representation of interconnections between repositories either 
via friends or provenance.  Did you know that there are 52 distinct XML 
metadata schemas in use by OAI repositories!

Based on this database I also have developed an experimental OAI redirector. 
  If you have an OAI identifier (i.e. oai:PITTAEI.OAI2:558) but don't know 
where it came from, submit it to

   http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/rx?oai:PITTAEI.OAI2:558

and you will be redirected to the oai_dc format record for that id, if an 
appropriate baseURL can be found in the registry database.  Unfortunately it 
appears than many sites, especially the GenericEprints, are using the same 
repo identifier (see http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListRepoIds.asp), 
so if there are multiple possible baseURLs for a given id, I have a ranking 
algorithm that attempts to guess the best. I may do some more work on this 
in the future, maybe looking at an OpenURL type resolver function.

Anyway, feel free to try it out and let me know of any problems or 
suggestions you might have.  Also, if you know of any more OAI providers I 
should add let me know.

Kind regards,
	Tom

Many data providers don't use oai-identifier schema, in extreme cases
for example dispute (http://dispute.library.uu.nl/cgi-bin/oai.pl) uses numbers
such as 3465,3481. It'll be extremely hard (or impossible) to develop a
resolver for this kind of identifier.

I had same problem in DP9, I think the proposed PURL OAI schema
(http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july03/young/07young.html) also needs to solve
the same problem.

Probably some actions can be taken to ensure the possibility of a general
resolver?

I should have indicated that it will only attempt to resolve an identifier 
if the identifier follows the oai-identifier scheme.  However, even in those 
cases it is difficult or impossible, especially when there are many 
providers minting oai identifiers with the same repository-identifier.

I'll need to look at the PURL OAI proposal.

Why would someone use an oai-identifier resolver in the first place? The
answer seems to be that the oai-identifier has become disassociated from the
baseURL at some point in a process. If this disassociation was
unintentional, then such a resolver would give downstream process a chance
to recover the context. If it's not an oai-identifier, though, would
downstream processes even know that it IS OAI-related and they could
potentially look it up?

The solution seems to be to create processes that retain the context along
with the identifier, regardless of whether it conforms to the oai-identifier
scheme or not. One way would be to pass along the entire GetRecord request
instead of just the identifier. 

If an OAI repository registry such as the one Thomas created could assign a
unique ID to every repository it knows about (regardless of oai-identifier
compliance), that could be the basis for the PURL OAI scheme discussed in
the DLib paper. In this case, the PURL could be passed along in place of the
relatively ugly GetRecord request.

Thomas,

Could you make the Repository Registry OAI harvestable? This might make it
more easily used by automated processes. It would also allow you to dispense
with some of the custom interface and searching you have and use OAI
requests/XSLT to provide the information instead.

Tom,

A first glance suggests that this is a very interesting view of the OAI
landscape from many perspectives.  For me, your report on our OAI data
provider at LC provides a useful view of our repository that I can point
others at (e.g. for the record counts).  I'm assuming part of the
motivation for creating it was for UIUC to select content for harvesting.  
I can certainly see its value for potential harvesters who are doing
manual selection of cultural heritage content in focused areas.  I can
image the search feature being particularly useful to take advantage of
rich set descriptions.  

One comment.  It took me some time to see that the link from a number of
records in the count table was actually a way to sample record(s) included
in the indexing.  For understanding why a search generated a hit, I think
it would be useful to be able to get to the complete set of samples for a
repository from the repository summary -- or to get straight to the
samples that generated hits from the hits list.  Just a thought.

As a small aside, special characters are not being handled gracefully.  
When I view http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/details.asp?id=103 in
Netscape 7.02 or IE 6.0 the description and title in cyrillic for the
grabill set are not coming through.  I realize there are a lot of things
that could be wrong (and haven't had time for detective work).  Are other
seeing the same problem?

Thanks again for the tool and summary reports.

Hi Caroline,

Thanks for taking the time to look at the registry and provide some feedback.

This is exactly why I started building it.  Although, I must say that once I 
got started it began to take on a life of its own.  Its amazing all the 
things you can think of doing once you have a rich database in front of you.

Good ideas.  I will see if there is anything I can do to improve in this area.

There are definitely some character encoding problems.  Not just with your 
cyrillic but also with some of the asian languages, and probably others. 
Figuring this one out is my priority for the moment.

The cyrillic problem should be solved.  Looks like my strings were passing 
through one-too-many character encoding conversions.

Any other respositories with similar character display problems should be 
corrected the next time I do an automated reharvest.  If you would like to 
expedite that process just send me a note, and I'll force a manual reharvest 
of your particular repository.

Apologies for duplication:

The Open Archives Initiative announces the beta release of the
Specification for an OAI Static Repository and an OAI Static Repository
Gateway. A Static Repository provides a simple approach for exposing
relatively static and small collections of metadata records through the
OAI-PMH.

This beta release follows a period of alpha testing during which
implementations were written to the specification and functional details
addressed. Public comment is invited during this beta period.  

The full press release is available at:
http://www.openarchives.org/news/oaistaticrepo031010.html 

The specification is available at:

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI identifier resolver
Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE980633249A@oa3-server.oa.oclc.org>

As a result of discussion following Tom Habing's announcement of an
Experimental OAI Registry at UIUC, I put together an alternative OAI
identifier resolver. Details can be found at the service's web site at
http://purl.org/oai.

Here is the basic pattern for oai-identifiers:

"http://purl.org/oai/" + <oai-identifier>

For example (from the Virginia Tech ETD Repository):

http://purl.org/oai/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749 - default to the oai_dc
entry

Other metadataFormats are accessible by appending the metadataPrefix as an
extension:

http://purl.org/oai/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749.oai_marc

For repositories that don't use the oai-identifier scheme, the pattern is:

"http://purl.org/oai/" + <repositoryIdentifier> + "/" + <identifier>

For example (from DSpace at MIT):

http://purl.org/oai/hpds1.mit.edu/hdl:1721.1/659.oai_dc

Note that I had to add an explicit metadataPrefix extension in this case so
it didn't interpret the metadataPrefix extension as "1/659" due the period
in the identifier.

I also plan to add a ".POI" extension that will return the web resource from
the first dc:identifier in the oai_dc record, but for some reason it's not
working on the production server yet.

There are only three repositories supported by this service
(http://alcme.oclc.org/oai/OAIHandler?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc
), but the rest will be available when Tom's registry is harvestable.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

The POI stuff hasn't been shared very widely on this list - though Jeff
has alluded to it on a couple of occassions.  So here's an announcement...

 The PURL-based Object Identifier (POI)
 http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/poi/

Jeff Young, Thom Hickey and myself wrote this proposal some time ago but
unfortunately we (or perhaps I should say, I) haven't had time to push it
forward very successfully.  The intention, as it says in the introduction,
is to provide a "relatively persistent identifier for resources that are
described by metadata 'items' in OAI-compliant repositories" and that
builds on the investment people are already making in assigning
oai-identifiers to the OAI 'items' that describe those resources.

A second document...

 POI resolver guidelines
 http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/poi/resolver-guidelines/

describes how to configure the PURL system to resolve POIs.

I'd be very interested in people's comments on this proposal.
Furthermore I'd be interested in views on whether/how we should move this
forward - as an article in D-Lib Magazine, as an RFC, or as something
else?

Two comments:

-- If URL takes the format
http://purl.org/oai/<metadata-format>/<oai-identifier>, it will make it
much easier to parse the special format identifier like hdl:1721.1/659,
the program will know whole part after "metadata-format" is
oai-identifier.

-- I wonder if it's useful to assign repository ID by hashing
the baseURL, this will make it possible to develop applications without
prior agreement on unique ID of repositories.

For example, the baseURL of DSpace (http://hpds1.mit.edu/oai/) can be
hashed to 2D0DA5560CAFBA3912A522345ECA4271 by MD5 algorithm. If both POI
and UIUC resolvers use this algorithm, the same repository ID can be
generated without prior agreement.

new functionality. Here are the new and improved examples::
 
Basic URL (just like before):
http://purl.org/oai/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749 - implicit oai_dc
GetRecord
 
This basic URL can then be appended as needed to obtain various views of the
item. 
 
The following examples are like before, but use "?ext" instead of ".ext" as
the switch.
 
http://purl.org/oai/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749?ListMetadataFormats
http://purl.org/oai/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749?oai_dc - explicit oai_dc
GetRecord
http://purl.org/oai/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749?oai_marc - explicit
oai_marc GetRecord
http://purl.org/oai/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749?POI - A redirect to the
first resolvable dc:identifier in the oai_dc GetRecord.
 
The following examples represent new functionality. The ".ext" is like the
"?ext" version except that it resovles to the content of the <metadata>
element in the GetRecord response rather than the entire GetRecord response:
http://purl.org/oai/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749.oai_dc - The oai_dc record
without the OAI wrapper
http://purl.org/oai/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749.oai_marc - The oai_marc
record without the OAI wrapper
 
What's cool about this new feature is that you can now store XML content in
an OAI repository and access it with natural looking URLs (see the last
example in the list). Here is an example of an XHTML document stored in an
OAI repository:
http://purl.org/oai/test/xhtmlTest - An implicit oai_dc GetRecord response
describing a xhtml document.
http://purl.org/oai/test/xhtmlTest?oai_dc - An explicit oai_dc GetRecord
response
http://purl.org/oai/test/xhtmlTest?xhtml - An OAI GetRecord response for the
same item in xhtml format
http://purl.org/oai/test/xhtmlTest.xhtml - The XHTML document itself.
 
Here is an example of an XML Schema document stored in an OAI repository:
http://purl.org/oai/test/xsdTest - An oai_dc GetRecord response describing
an XML Schema document
http://purl.org/oai/test/xsdTest?xsd - An OAI GetRecord response for the
same item in xsd format
http://purl.org/oai/test/xsdTest.xsd - The XML Schema document itself
 
Note that this also works for the Handle example which was causing problems
earlier:
 
http://purl.org/oai/hpds1.mit.edu/hdl:1721.1/659 - Implied oai_dc GetRecord
response
http://purl.org/oai/hpds1.mit.edu/hdl:1721.1/659?ListMetadataFormats
http://purl.org/oai/hpds1.mit.edu/hdl:1721.1/659?oai_dc - explicit oai_dc
GetRecord response
http://purl.org/oai/hpds1.mit.edu/hdl:1721.1/659?POI - a redirect to the
first resolvable dc:identifier
http://purl.org/oai/hpds1.mit.edu/hdl:1721.1/659.oai_dc - The oai_dc content
without the OAI wrapper.
 
The reason the Handle example is no longer a problem is because before I was
too lazy to verify the metadataPrefix to make sure I wasn't hacking up the
identifier by mistake. This isn't a problem now because I have to get the
record anyway to pull out the <metadata> portion to send back. Now, if I
discover it is a problem, I restore the identifier and force the
metadataPrefix back to the oai_dc default and try again.

Xiaoming,

- The reason I moved away from the form
http://purl.org/oai/<metadata-format>/<oai-identifier> is because I'm trying
to avoid forcing others to parse such URL to get variant results. Now, the
service centers around a single basic URL that can produce a multitude of
results without parsing the URL by appending various types of extensions
rather than a set of URLs for each identifier. As of this morning's
revision, the hdl:1721.1/659 should no longer be ambiguous.

- My hope is that these URLs will be as natural-looking as possible, which
is why I'm advocating the assignment of meaningful repositoryIdentifiers
during the registration process, even for repositories that don't use the
oai-identifier schema.

I think we all agree it's useful to uniquely identify a repository and all
its records in an URL-friendly way. Thus different service providers and
data providers can easily interoperate.

I just personally feel it's probably easier to agree on an algorithm than
a centralized registration mechanism. MD5 generated fingerprint is probably
too long, but other hashing algorithms (like CRC32) can generate much
shorter signature.

Just so we're clear, this service does indeed only work in conjunction with
a single "centralized" OAI-harvestable registry. That is by design. My hope
is that Tom Habing's registry will eventually become harvestable, so I can
point at it instead of my dummy registry. My service doesn't really care how
the repositoryIdentifiers are assigned in the Registry (hashed, sequential
numbers, or manually assigned), as long as it's embedded in the identifier
for each registered repository in some structured way. 

Keep in mind, though, once a repositoryIdentifier is assigned, my service
will fail to resolve old URLs if it is changed from something ugly to
something meaningful (unless the old identifier is retained in the registry
as well).

If repositories don't want to register with Tom, it would be possible to set
up other private registry/resolver combinations for particular communities.
Perhaps Tom would consider distributing his Registry software as open-source
to facilitate this need.

If a repository doesn't want to register anywhere, then it's still possible
to create a set of PURL partial redirects that look like the ones you
proposed earlier.

If a record changes its set membership, no notification would be given on an

I agree hash algorithm is not a "perfect" way to generate unique
identifier for a repository, but it may be acceptable in engineering
perspect, the collision possibility will be pretty low in current scale of oai data
providers (<500?).

I think the basic problem is how to render OAI baseURL to a shorter,
readable string in non-collision way. The algorithm should be repeatable
-- Anyone can use same algorithm to generate same output given a baseURL.
I will be glad to see other approaches.

I am in favor of just the URL:[collection name] approach.  Why make it 
more complicated than necessary? URL's are unique. Is there a particular 
reason why it needs to be shorter?

This is back to the problem why we need a resolver. If both baseURL and
record identifier are supplied, it doesn't make a lot sense to develop a
resolver. I think the motivation is to provide a "cool" URL for each
record, and make it easy to exchange information by REST model.

OAI has no centralized mechanism to maintain unique repository name, it's
either done by one centralized registry -- like UIUC registry, or done
by a distributed way -- like hashing baseURL or other better ways. In the
distributed way, I can add a link to Purl-OAI resolver without prior
knowledge of how repository name is maintained in Purl-OAI resolver.
That's my reason of favoring distributed method.

A MD5 hash is an incredible safe hash to use. It would take you
2^64 unique identifiers to come up with a collision. This will take
you about 585 years if you allow for a creation of about 1,000,000,000 
identifiers per second.

for a live OAI repository that that I can use to checkout a client-side
implememtation of OAI 2.0.  Does anyone have a repository that does flow

An easy way to assign unique identifiers without using a central registration
would be UUID's. See also:

ftp://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mealling-uuid-urn-01.txt

The uuid is in the processes of becomming an urn scheme. With it's
128 bit key as one of the features it is pretty strong preventing
collisions (see my previous post).

Best easiest solution I could see was to say records could not change
their set membership. If they need to, then create a new record with
a new id.

Problems arise because records can belong to multiple sets. A harvester
may collect using two sets from the one repository. Generating 'set update'
messages or something gets nasty and confusing. I think its better to
come up with a solution that does not require any additions to the spec
in terms of new packets etc.

Maybe another way is to delete then create the item (and hence all
records derived from that item) so harvesters think the record (with the
old set membership) goes away first, then comes back to life again (with
the new set membership).

We are planning to change set names on all the NDLTD theses records we put
up for harvesting to use the MARC Organization codes instead of the ad-hoc
names we have been using so far.  But we don't want to change the ID's
associated with the records and break any links into the repository that
might exist, so I'd say deletion/creation with a new ID might be a cure
worse than the problem it is solving.

I suspect our solution will be to just add additional sets and at some
future date delete the older set names.

I agree that creating "cool" URLs is the main motivation I have for using a
resolver. I've used such "cool" URLs in association with OAI repositories in
several projects including the OpenURL registry
(http://www.openurl.info/registry) and several thesauri including GSAFD
Genre Terms at http://alcme.oclc.org/gsafd/.

Regarding distributed solutions, I've already offered to make the resolver
code available as open source for communities that want to host an
independent registry of repositories. I could also make a knockoff of it
that would work with a single repository if people are interested. I could
make the stand-alone version available as a Java Servlet and/or a CGI script
of some sort if asked.

I think the concern about algorithmically assigned repositoryIdentifiers is
overstated. If someone cares to give a specific example of where it's a
problem, I'm sure we can work out something reasonable.

I'd like to concur with Thom that deletion/creation with a new ID would
"be a cure worse than the problem it is solving."  Records for OAI are not
usually managed independently.  The record IDs may play a role in managing
the content or be generated outside the OAI repository.

Patrick,

Thanks for locating and distributing the pointer to this IETF draft.  It 
appears to be carefully thought through.  It would certainly be much 
better to leverage an existing mechanism, rather than generate a new one 
specifically for OAI. 

Regards,

Adam.

Message-ID: <40700B4C02ABD5119F00009027876644084DF27F@hplex1.hpl.hp.com>

Hello,

This is related to a discussion on the OAI-implementers list about moving records in and out of sets.  The next release of DSpace will have some functionality which will affect how DSpace might implement sets.

Briefly, currently, DSpace has Communities at the top level.  Communities contain Collections, and Collections contain Items.  The structure of Communities and Collections are exposed to harvesters via the OAI-PMH set mechanism.  More details are here (see section entitled 'Sets'):

http://dspace.org/technology/system-docs/application.html#oai

The forthcoming features that affect use of OAI-PMH sets are:

1/ UI tool to add Items to more than one Collection.  This tool may also allow Items to be moved from one Collection to another.  In either case, as highlighted by the 'Moving records in and out of sets' thread on OAI-implementers, it is not clear how the OAI-PMH data provider in DSpace should deal with either event.

2/ Allowing a richer Community structure, i.e. Communities can contain other Communities.  This may not be a strict hierarchy; for example, a research project Community may be jointly run by two departments at MIT.  I don't believe this could be expressed in the set structure exposed via OAI-PMH.  Additionally, this means the set structure of DSpace at MIT (and other universities) is likely to change significantly and I'm not clear on how this should be exposed via OAI-PMH when the underlying records (Items) have not changed.

3/ A Collection may appear in more than one Community.  Again this would seem to break the 'hierarchy' constraint on the OAI set mechanism.

I can think of a couple of possible directions:

a/ Drop support for the set mechanism in DSpace completely.  It seems a shame to not expose the structure in DSpace, since I can see selective harvesting for a particular Community might be very useful for a department wanting to add a search DSpace function to their Web page/portal/etc.  However, the structure is becoming more complex than the simple hierarchy OAI-PMH allows.

b/ Expose DSpace Collections as OAI-PMH sets; these would be flat and not a hierarchy.  This would still allow some selective harvesting but harvesters would not be able to harvest by Community which intuitively seems likely to be the most useful selective harvest.  This does still expose us to the 'what happens when an Item is moved between or added to additional Collections' issue however.

Out of interest, how many people actually use sets for selective harvesting?  My feeling is that while it's not vital now, as the volume of data in systems like DSpace grows it will become increasingly useful.

Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?

I try to give an example. Let's say if a service provider wants to link
each record to POI, how could it construct the URL? it doesn't have prior
knowledge of which repository is supported by POI, nor how the
repositoryIdentifier is maintained by POI. So it has to learn the mapping
table (repId<->baseURL). I don't know if there is an API to list mapping
table of PURL, otherwise, this may require offline communication.

Even POI mapping table can be easily available, other service
providers/resolvers may maintain their own mapping table. I don't see an
easy way to keep a single mapping table without centralized control.

In response to your question about how many people use sets for selective 
harvesting...

At UIUC for our Gateway to Cultural Heritage Resources 
(http://nergal.grainger.uiuc.edu/search/) we selectively harvest sets 
because our indexes are based on the general type of material (eg. images 
and video, text and sheet music, archival collections are our three very 
general groupings). Harvesting specific sets allows us to broadly 
categorize collections by type of material.

In our IMLS Digital Collections and Content project 
(http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu) we are selectively harvesting sets that 
are specific IMLS funded digital collections.  For data providers which do 
not provide sets, we end up writing filters on our ends that grab the IMLS 
funded resources.

I think sets are going to be absolutely vital -- it'll be interesting, 
however, to see how they develop.  I think that data providers have tended 
to create sets based on their internal structures and needs;  it might be 
more productive to understand what service providers need/use sets for.

UUID uses Ethercard address and timestamp to generate unique id. It can
guarantee uniqueness but is not repeatable. Here we want a method which
generate unique id based on baseURL, and the method can be repeated by any
party. So I believe UUID is not appropriate for this purpose.

OAIster also uses sets quite often for selective harvesting,  
particularly when harvesting certain aggregator repositories, i.e.,  
OLACA, NSDL, etc.

I agree with Sarah: sets are vital. I need to harvest aggregator  
repositories because they contain records that aren't available through  
other data provider channels, but I need to weed out those records that  
I DO get through other data provider channels. I use sets to do this.

In this case, I would recommend that the service provider create and
maintain its own OAI harvestable registry of OAI repositories that it
supports. I was able to set up my dummy registry using OAICat in minutes.
Since this registry is under the service provider's control, it is free to
assign meaningful repositoryIdentifiers to each supported repository. If the
supported repository uses oai-identifiers, then the repositoryIdentifier can
be taken from that. Otherwise, the service provider can feel free to assign
any meaningful name it wants.

Given this registry, you could then download the open-source resolver code
I'm offering and run it yourself against this registry. The basic URLs would
look like this:

http://servicesRus.com/oai/<oai-identifier>
or
http://servicesRus.com/oai/<repositoryIdentifier>/<identifier>

>From there, you can append any of the ".extension" or "?extension" modifiers
from my examples, including the "?POI" extension.

The identifiers used by OAI-PMH ought to be as rigorous and globally unique
and technically possible. Seems no reason not to.

But, maybe slightly off topic, there is a need for persistent URLs
engineered for human consumption. Here I describe a simple way to produce
persistent URLs for citations, scribbling on napkins, memory or
communicating by voice or email. It nightly grabs data from ETD-db and
Eprints.org archives into into the resolver script.

Sponsler, Ed (2001) PURR - The Persistent URL Resource Resolver.
http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechLIB:2001.003

The purpose of these URLs are to give humans something easy to remember and
communicate via voice, email, napkin, etc., they make "clean" looking
citations and are good for placing within the documents they point to. Their
persistence is backed by our institutes policy to committ to the long term
preservation of our CODA (digital archive) project.

I am in favor of just the URL:[collection name] approach.  Why make it more

not a good 'engineering' approach, especially when there are other
approaches that do not fail.  For example, taking a base64 encoding of the
base URL or just using the base URL itself will both provide a unique
identifier.

Adam.


Hash algorithms such as MD5 or CRC32 cannot be used to generate
uniqueidentifiers.  These algorithms will occasionally produce the same
output fordifferent input strings (this is why hash tables require a
mechanism for dealingwith collisions).  Common approaches to generating
unique identifiers use somesort of a registration mechanism to appropriately
partition the space of possiblevalues.  Successful ones will leverage an
existing registration mechanism, suchas DNS.    
I agree hash algorithm is not a "perfect" way to generate uniqueidentifier
for a repository, but it may be acceptable in engineeringperspect, the
collision possibility will be pretty low in current scale of oai
dataproviders (<500?).I think the basic problem is how to render OAI baseURL
to a shorter,readable string in non-collision way. The algorithm should be
repeatable-- Anyone can use same algorithm to generate same output given a
baseURL.I will be glad to see other approaches.

hi

here are my thoughts on this ...

hypothetically, how about if think of the OAI-PMH as a transaction 
distribution framework. i.e., for each data provider to maintain every 
archive change of state as a transaction and then translate these into 
instantaneous views of the archive whenever OAI-PMH requests arrive. 
(somewhat db-like i guess)

now, while i know lots of people would like a deterministic solution to 
the "problem", i think complete solutions such as what i just outlined 
go against the fundamental philosophy that OAI-PMH should be easy for 
data providers to implement (and possibly requiring more effort from 
service providers).

service providers SHOULD be willing to sift through records to find what 
they need - i am sure this was discussed many moons ago ... that said, 
NDLTD currently uses the approach that Robert has suggested as an option 
- no set structure at all! simply because the amount of work necessary 
to come up with and manage meaningful sets is non-trivial and it is so 
much more important to share the data in the first place.

if the sets are not incredibly obvious (e.g., a thesis will always be a 
thesis!) i would not use sets - instead encode what is essentially 
"attribute" information into your metadata directly (in whatever formats 
you support) so service providers can sift through records on the basis 
of this information.

please let us stay away from any practices that make OAI-PMH 
implementation more difficult for data providers.

The set structure in OAI is very simple, but also has almost complete
flexibility, so I'm sure you could encode any relationships that DSpace is
aware of in them.  But the retrieval on sets is quite limited, so it isn't
clear what good it would do.  

I agree with Hussein -- keep them simple.  For DSpace, possibly a unique ID
for each collection.

Seems to me that search, selection and sortation would *all* be much more
useful at the service provider level if we had standardized lists of sets AND
subjects (LCSH?  SEARS?)  from which to select when creating records at the
repository level.

My understanding was that sets could be flat or hierarchical; presumably this means a strict hierarchy, i.e. no node could have >1 parent -- is this correct?  If so, DSpace could not expose the case where a Collection appears in two Communities, since the same Collection would have two setSpecs.  However, thinking about it, maybe this is actually OK, since that Collection would effectively be two OAI sets with two separate setSpecs; for selective harvesting purposes, harvesters don't necessarily need to know that the two sets are in fact the same Collection.

Here's a quick example in case this isn't clear... Collection C is contained in Community A and Community B:

Community A      Community B
        \          /
         \        /
          \      /
         Collection C

The exposed OAI set structure would be:

setSpec     setName
 A          Community A
 A:C        Collection C
 B          Community B
 B:C        Collection C

Is there any reason why the above might be 'illegal' in OAI-PMH?  Might any harvesters get confused?

P.S. sorry if cross-posting to dspace-tech & oai-implementers caused any duplication weirdness... I for one seemed to get about 6 copies of replies, I don't know whether that was the mailing lists or my client getting confused though!

I believe what you are proposing is perfectly legal, but there is no
implication in OAI that A:C has anything to do with B:C, and no way to
harvest collection C without specifying a community of A or B.  Of course
the set description could explain all this and a group could come to
agreement as to how the sets were going to be used.

Interesting scenario Rob, and I think your description is sound. In the
OAI context the set structure really doesn't have a notion of set "C":
there are only sets "A:C" and "B:C", strict subsets of "A" and "B", which
happen to have the same content.

The other option is to put everything at the first level and have sets:
"ComA", "ComB" and "ColC" where it just happens that all items in "ColC"  
are also in "ComA" and "ComB". (I think this is what Thom meant by a
unique id for each collection)

As you say, sets are for selective harvesting (not for classification per
se), so the choice should be motivated by the likely usefulness for
harvesters.

Cheers,
Simeon.

This is an excellent point.  It seems to me that to make reasonable any use of sets, there must be some understanding between the harvester and data provider between the meaning of the sets.  This is very much akin to the metadata interoperability problem.  Perhaps we could find some way of allowing data providers to expose their metadata in terms of standard vocabularies; e.g. a set hierarchy based on media type, or subject categorisation.  A quick and practical way to do this would be to check for the existence of certain top-level sets with specific IDs.  For example, if one supported LCSH sets, one could have a top-level set with the setSpec 'LCSH' and harvesters could look for this and react accordingly if it does or does not exist.  Or perhaps a future version of OAI-PMH could support 'set formats' in a similar manner to metadata formats.

This does all seem to be pushing work to the data provider; I could see that this may lead to sets being used effectively as dynamic queries to repositories.  For example, a data provider might respond to a harvest of a LCSH set using some index search.  It does seem that the smarts for what get harvested (i.e. what is interesting for the users of the OAI service doing the harvesting) is a decision that should be made by the OAI service rather than the data provider.

Whether sets are perceived as vital, useful or useless, however, it does seem to me there seems to be some way for a service provider to be able to programmatically work out whether it understands (at least some of) the set structure of a data provider.  Otherwise it'll only every be useful for the 'point-to-point' case.  It is a very similar problem to the 'metadata format' problem, except that at the moment we don't have a simple base 'set format' akin to Dublin Core.

Which leads me back to the original point of the thread, what should we do about sets in DSpace?  The above thinking leads me to believe that exposing sets in DSpace is of very limited use, since the structure is probably going to be unique between instances of DSpace, and harvesters would require very specific knowledge of the individual DSpace instance to be able to make use of those sets.

Discuss ;-)

For an interesting view of set usage across different OAI repositories look 
at my Experimental OAI Registry at http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/, 
specifically the miscellaneous reports:

   Repositories Sorted by Number of Sets
   Frequently Occurring Distinct Set Specs
   Browse All Distinct Set Specs (hex encoded set are decoded)
   Frequently Occurring Distinct Set Names
   Browse All Distinct Set Names

 From this it appears that set usage is all over the place.  There are some 
repositories that have more sets than they do individual records.  There are 
also many that list sets for which they have no records.  And, while I 
understand why it was done, I am finding the setSpecs that are hex encoded 
strings to be quite annoying -- my OAI pet peeve of the moment. :-)

Anyway, I guess I am seconding the call for some set standardization as long 
as it stays simple.  I also like Sarah Shreeves idea that this should be 
driven in large part by service providers and not just metadata providers.

Kind regards,
	Tom

hi

while everyone says their piece on standardisation of sets, can we 
please think carefully on where this falls in the spectrum between data 
provision and service provision.

it seems this is a first-tier service rather than a data provider 
function. as such, it can be implemented (and has been in the ODL 
project and NDLTD Union Catalog) as a component that analyses metadata 
and dynamically organises records into sets for further 
access/harvesting. of course this means thinking of digital libraries as 
collections of service-oriented components ... very much in line with 
the Web Services philosophy.

so why aren't other service providers doing this?

ttfn,
----hussein

p.s. is LCSH international? is it used in South Africa? Ethiopia?

Hi Hussein--
  You have good points.  I was thinking that if we had a standardized set of
subjects/sets to use, it would be simpler/easier to analyze/divide/catalog
the records, for further use. Are there any international standards that
could be used?

just to interject:  if you find yourself building complex set lattices
(such as Rob's example), you *might* have separate, orthogonal sets that
you're trying to "mush" into a single set hierarchy.  cf. "institutions"
and "subjects" in section 2.6 of the OAI-PMH spec.

No. LCSH is not international.  It is used in many places, but the
policies and practices do not include an attempt to serve international
needs (to judge from discussions of the problem issues that required
policy decisions, when I had a detail to the part of LC that maintains
LCSH).  LCSH is also enormous.  I remember an analysis in the fairly early
days of OAI by Old Dominion that implied that LC didn't use controlled
vocabulary in its subject terms in OAI records, because of the number of
distinct terms in our records.

Back to sets in OAI.

I agree that discussion about what is useful for harvesters is valuable.
If there is good evidence that certain practices for sets work for
certain categories of service providers, data providers who care
about whether or how their stuff appears in those particular services
may take steps to use sets that aren't related to internal processes or
organization.  Absent any such evidence, you can hardly blame them for
doing what is easy.  And for many, there are no resources to do
anything more than a simple technical transformation from internal
records.

For what it's worth, the issue of how early implementer were using sets
was looked at in the technical discussions that led to the development of
version 2 of OAI-PMH.  

"Out of 49 repositories, 39 are using sets. Of these 13 appear to
partition their collection by subject area, 13 by genre, and 9 by source
of records."

See the table at the end of 
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/oai/collection-description/whitepaper.html
for more detail.  [Thanks to Andy Powell for being a pack-rat and still
having the file at the URL I found by mining my e-mail!]

It's not clear that anyone was using sets to provide fine-grained subject
breakdowns (which some repositories now are).  There may be communities of
interest where that is useful and feasible, but in the cultural heritage
area (personal papers, digitized, manuscripts, photographs, museum
artifacts, etc.) there is plenty of evidence that agreement on "topical"
terminology and rules for application across heterogeneous domains is
neither feasible, nor indeed helpful.

For the content in the LCOA1 repository, LC has more interest in creating
sets that are useful for Kat Hagedorn (OAIster) and Sara Shreeves (UIUC)
and other service providers that focus on building services that are
likely to serve people to whom our digitized historical content is of
interest.  My sense is that a set breakdown that suits those service
-providers (and this sort of content) would be very different from a
breakdown that is useful for current scientific scholarly communication.

Perhaps providers of production services can indicate if this list
is a useful forum for discussing what practices in relation to sets make
sense to them.  They may be having discussions within a community through
other lists or meetings.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] converting filenames of metadata records
Message-ID: <3F9696C6.8060201@smail.uni-koeln.de>

Hello

i am developping a middleware, that uses metadata harvested with the 
DLESE OAI software.

thus, there is a directory with hundreds of metadata records, that are 
not sorted nor can queries be formulated in order to retrieve the 
relevant among them.

Q1:Am i right assuming that repositories DO NOT offer any search 
interfaces, but provide their entire metadata and nothing more?

Q2:Am i right assuming that the DLESE OAI software has the apache lucene 
search api integrated, but is not yet working?


however, i am currently trying to use the apache lucene search api to 
index these records and make them searchable.

certain problem appears, when i try to read a record :


     SAXBuilder builder = new SAXBuilder();
     try {
       Document doc = builder.build(recordfile.getAbsoluteFile());
       Element root = doc.getRootElement();
       listChildren(root, 0);
     }

i always get an io.FileNotFoundException, as the oai-pmh changes the 
host separator  " : " into " %3A "
the pathname indicated at debugging is the correct one (using the "%3A" 
, such as the record files on my system)

but the exception tells me :

java.io.FileNotFoundException: 
/home/tom/mwd/metadata/7374617475733D696E7072657373/oai_dc/oai:sammelpunkt.philo.at:103.xml 
(No such file or directory)

i am working on a linux system.



Q3:Is it possible to tell the DLESE OAI Software to save the records on 
the local system using ":" instead of the hex representation, or, to 
wrap the records filename in a way that
admits the java native classes to open the records?



Thanks a lot for any hint

Thomas

ENC uses sets. After reviewing the white paper below I think expanding
ListSets may solve quite a few problems. One issue I need to deal with
is recognition of partners and funding agencies through a logo, or icon.
I assign a <setSpec> value in the header which the NSDL folks in turn
look up and display. For my purposes a tag in ListSets such as <setLogo>
or <setBrand> may provide more standardization, flexibility and utility
across the OAI community.

hi

there is already a "setDescription" container associated with any set 
that can do this, possibly using the "branding" format that you can find 
in the OAI guidelines.

see section 3.2 on http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines.htm

hi,

I would like to ask someone involved in the German
DINI effort re the establishment of institutional
OAI-PMH repositories to chip in, and give some
insights in their use of sets.  I know they have
established recommendations about the implementation
of sets in their environment.  As far as I remember,
they have defined sets to convey e.g. material type,
publication type, etc.  

BTW: These people are doing interesting "community"
work.  They have just released a document that lists
requirements for repositories operated in their
community to receive the "certified DINI OAI-PMH repo"
status.

Thomas,

for now it is not possible to tell the DLESE OAI software to leave the
colons in file names unencoded rather than converting them to %3A. The
software does this because Windows file systems don't accept colons (and
some other chars) as valid characters, and the software is designed to be
cross-platform compatible. 

A number of people have reported having this problem, however, so I may
change the way file names are encoded in future releases of the software
to make them easier to work with (suggestions anyone?).

That being said, I have had success opening and reading files that are
encoded this way using the dom4j XML APIs (available at
http://www.dom4j.org/). Sample code:


import org.dom4j.Document;
import org.dom4j.DocumentException;
import org.dom4j.io.SAXReader;

...

File dir = new File("/home/jweather/ ... /dlese.org/oai/provider/avc/nsdl_dc");
File [] files = dir.listFiles();

Document document;

for(int i = 0; i < files.length; i++){
   document = reader.read(files[i]);
   
   // Process the doc...

}


Another possibility in your code below: in the builder.build(...)  
method, try passing in a java.io.InputStream, java.io.Reader or
java.net.URL instead of the java.io.File and see if that works.

Steve,

I'm not sure if it was clear from my message, that the white paper I
pointed to was a discussion paper written 2 years ago to begin discussions
on the degree to which version 2 of the protocol should formalize or guide
the use of sets.  The issues at the bottom were discussed and what you see
in the current protocol is what came out of those discussion.  What was
implemented in version 2 was the ability to use any XML Schema for set
description.  This would allow communities to establish their own
practices.  And XML Schemas developed for one community might be adopted
in others.

I can see reason for wanting branding at the set level, but I have been
more interested in getting rich set descriptions out there to see if
harvesters found them useful [the answer from the harvesters I care about
has been "yes"].  I used Dublin Core because it was there.  If someone
else wanted to create a schema that added a branding element, I would use
it.  It's not clear to me that my repository branding icon is actually
being used anywhere, and so this hasn't been top of my priority list.

Allow me to second that, but from another side. One way that I'd like
to use OAI is to take records originated at other sites, and add
metadatda. I'd rather have records disappear and reappear silently
than to change IDs, because a changed ID means that my added metadata
is lost. But an ideal solution would have permanent IDs, and correctly
include information about disappearing and appeard records in
incremental updates.

It seems appropriate to mention here that the DCMI Collection
Description Working Group 

http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/

(to which I know several people here already contribute) is currently
working on developing a simple Dublin Core-based schema (a DC
"application profile" in DCMI terminology) for collection-level
description. 

It seems to me such a schema could be deployed to describe either the
content of an entire repository or a set, as suggested in the document
Caroline pointed to. And one of the requests from WG members was that
the schema should include a property that provided a pointer to a
(collection-specific) logo. 

That property is not listed in the current draft 

http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/collection-ap-summary/2003-08-25/

as I've been too busy in the last few days to produce a new draft that
reflects the decisions at our meeting at DC-2003

http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0310&L=dc-collections&T=0
&F=&S=&P=59

But I'll have an updated version out, umm, real soon....

This discussion is related to a previous one on this list:
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2003-April/000829.html

Quoting Andy: "The item identifier is not the same as the resource 
identifier - because the item is not the same as the resource."

Therefore an OAI harvester should not rely upon the OAI identifier being 
in any way persistent for the resource. In a distributed system - 
especially with author-contributed resources - it is likely that there 
will be dupes, revisions, parts under multiple OAI identifiers and 
multiple repositories using the same OAI identifiers for different 
resources.

It is the *metadata* that describes the resource, not the OAI header, 
and it is the metadata that should contain a persistent, globally unique 
identifier for that resource (e.g. a DOI in DC.identifier).

I can't think of another solution to this set maintainence bug than 
"changing id" (flagging the old OAI item deleted, creating a new OAI 
item). Creating new sets  would seem to create more problems than it 
would solve (which is moving the goal-posts on harvesters).

All the best,
Tim.

I think the point is not that the OAI identifier is a resource identifier,
but that it is an identifier for the metadata, and the correspondence with
the metadata should be as permanent as is practical.  Of course metadata for
a given resource might come from multiple sources, but for a given OAI
repository the id should be stable.

Currently with NDLTD, which harvests around two dozen thesis repositories,
we have been reusing the harvested IDs.  Since we harvest duplicate metadata
and are going to consolidate it into a 'work' record, we will have to start
assigning our own ID's (and try to keep them stable!).

Quoting Andy: "The item identifier is not the same as the resource 
identifier - because the item is not the same as the resource."

Therefore an OAI harvester should not rely upon the OAI identifier being 
in any way persistent for the resource. In a distributed system - 
especially with author-contributed resources - it is likely that there 
will be dupes, revisions, parts under multiple OAI identifiers and 
multiple repositories using the same OAI identifiers for different 
resources.

It is the *metadata* that describes the resource, not the OAI header, 
and it is the metadata that should contain a persistent, globally unique 
identifier for that resource (e.g. a DOI in DC.identifier).

I can't think of another solution to this set maintainence bug than 
"changing id" (flagging the old OAI item deleted, creating a new OAI 
item). Creating new sets  would seem to create more problems than it 
would solve (which is moving the goal-posts on harvesters).

All the best,
Tim.

Hello,

I've been following this list with great interest for several months now.
This week I signed up to help a local bookbinding organization with
indexing their newsletter. The Newsletter (that's its title) has been running
since 1983 and contains a lot of valuable articles to the bookbinding
community. I've offered to put the current EndNote annotated
bibliography/index online.

I think this is the sort of resource that should be searchable and
findable by other people. The problem is, I'm not really sure where to
start. The web programming bit is easy, I made a little "collaborative
bibliography" for an organization last year. http://ftpd.maytree.com (I've
learned much about programming since then!)

Could someone please point me towards articles/URLs/etc on how to make a
metadata repository?

thank you,
emma

Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE98063324ED@oa3-server.oa.oclc.org>

I would like to announce a new Java OAIHarvester2 package available at
http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/harvester2.htm. This package
supports harvesting of both OAI v1.1 and v2.0 repositories.

This is an incompatible reimplementation of an earlier harvester that only
supported OAI v2.0. The old version is still available to support existing
users (http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/harvester.htm).

In addition to supporting both OAI-PMH v1.1 and v2.0, the new harvester is
much more lightweight. It can run as a standalone application or can be
integrated into existing applications. Whereas the old application had a
Java API that allowed processing of harvested records on the fly, the new
version simply consolidates the OAI responses into a single XML file for
subsequent processing (e.g. with XSLT).

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

Jeff

Dear Emma,

You might try the new 'OAI for Beginners online tutorial' which the Open Archives Forum has created at:

http://www.oaforum.org/tutorial/

This OAI Protocol online tutorial is based on two substantial pre-workshop tutorials the OA-F project ran in 2002-3, during its workshop series in Europe. A number of people contributed to these, including Andy Powell and Pete Cliff of UKOLN, and Uwe Muller of Humboldt University in Berlin. The material was developed to an extent out of materials created by various members of the OAI itself, including Herbert van de Soempel, Michael Nelson, etc. The OA-F has built on the experience of  these live tutorials, and the online version covers most of what potential implementers of the protocol need to know. As well as extensive referencing within the tutorial, it also points to relevant external resources.

Best wishes,

Philip Hunter

Another option for a relatively small data provider (< a few thousand 
records) is the static repository model recently announced on this list, see:

http://www.openarchives.org/news/oaistaticrepo031010.html

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-gateway.htm

The specification is still in beta, but we (UIUC) and, I believe, Los Alamos 
currently have experimental gateways running.  All you would need is a web 
accessible XML file that conforms to the gateway specification.

Message-ID: <20031028045339.GA29023@openlib.org>

Announcement [crossposted]

CERN Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication: 
"Implementing the benefits of OAI" 
3rd Workshop on the Open Archives Initiative (OAI3)

LIBER, SPARC and SPARC-Europe, and the CERN Library are organising the
third OAI workshop at CERN, Geneva (Switzerland) on 12-14 February 2004.


Please see further details and book online at 
http://info.web.cern.ch/info/OAIP/ 

The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was founded in 2000 to bring the
benefits of open archives-compliant software to the research community
and launch an international network of institutional repositories. 

Since OAI's founding, there have been many successful applications of
the technology, and a simultaneous, widespread understanding that open
archives technology is the foundation for the future of research. In the
field of scholarly communication there has also been a remarkable
evolution: open access journals have achieved respectability through the
activities of BioMed Central and PLoS and the number of such journals is
rising; scholarly societies are becoming interested in the open access
model, and we have seen some society publishers adopt the open access
model. The foremost granting agencies in the U.S. and the U.K. have both
issued statements supporting open access. 

However, libraries have not yet reaped large benefits from the OAI's
success. 

Through publishers' "big deals," more commercial journal titles than
ever before are accessible, and library budgets are tightly bound to
them in long-term contracts. Library customers are growing accustomed to
the enormous comfort offered by the databases of those publishers and,
as a consequence, switching to alternative models for scientific
communication has become less and less acceptable. We want to change
this. 

The third CERN workshop will bring together librarians and information
specialists, publishers, scientists and university managers who want to
bring the benefits of open archives technology and open access
publishing to libraries. The conference's action-focused agenda will
prioritize initiatives to be undertaken, in order to increase the impact
of OAI on the process of scientific publishing.

Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE9806332526@oa3-server.oa.oclc.org>

I am please to announce the official release of the new Extensible
Repository Resource Locators (ERRoLs) Service for resolving OAI identifiers
in various ways. The ERRoL project page is at
http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/oairesolver/default.htm.

This service can work with any repository registered in the "OAI Registry at
UIUC" that Tom Habing announced recently
(http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/). 

For oai-identifiers, the Core ERRoL pattern is this:

"http://purl.org/oai/" + <oai-identifier>

Below is a example of a Core ERRoL. This resolves to a list of Extended
ERRoLs that will return the various types of metadata and content related to
that identifier.

http://purl.org/oai/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749

For repositories that don't use the oai-identifier scheme, the Core ERRoL
pattern is this:

"http://purl.org/oai/" + <repositoryIdentifier> + "/" + <identifier>

For example:

http://purl.org/oai/ndltd.oclc.org/oai:VTETD:etd-06152001-152749

The list of available repositoryIdentifiers can be found at
(http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListRepoIds.asp?self=1).

Please check out some of the other cool things this service can do by
reading the project page.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

Sorry if you are having trouble getting this service to work properly. As a
web service, there should be no problems, but I'm told that browsers are
having trouble applying the XSLT stylesheet to the XML response. Turning on
cross-domain browsing in IE may help, but that's not really an acceptable
solution. I should have it fixed soon.

Message-ID: <3F9F8BA2.90009@rz.hu-berlin.de>

sorry for the late answer ...

DINI (German Inititave for Networked Information) has just published a
new version of recommendations for OAI data providers at German
universities. This paper mainly recommends three types of set
categorization and the appropriate semantic interpretation:

1. Publication Type, e.g. pub-type:dissertation or pub-type:article
2. Document Type, e.g. doc-type:text or doc-type:video
3. Subject Type, e.g. ddc:004 (according to DDC)

The recommendations are available at
http://www.dini.de/documents/2003-10-08-OAI-Empfehlungen.pdf
(Sorry, in German only, but setName is listed in English - so look at
the three tables for the different set types. There is an English
translation of a prior version of these recommendations avaliable at
http://www.dini.de/documents/DINI-OAI-e.pdf, the new version will be
available in English soon.)

Some of the German data providers have introduced these sets into their
OAI interfaces, and there has also been implemented a prototype for a
service provider using these set recommendations which can be found at
http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/e_suche/oai.php

Thanks for finding this bug.  I've added it to the SourceForge bug list and it should be fixed in 1.2.  It's not a big problem (just need to catch a number format exception and respond with the appropriate OAI error)

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Extensible Repository Resource Locators (E
 RRoLs) Service
Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE9806332541@oa3-server.oa.oclc.org>

I believe I've been able to work around the security problems IE was having
with the ERRoL service (http://purl.org/oai/). I also "fixed" the Netscape
display problems by rendering the results into HTML on the server. I would
be grateful if people reported any other problems they have with this
service. For example, I'm told that the Opera browser has problem, so I
added it to my to-do list.

Here's an interesting fact. IE has "security issues" with performing an HTTP
SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY (result code 302) to a document with ContentType
"text/xml". Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I was able to get
around this by setting the ContentType to "text/html" even when returning
XML responses. This seems to work fine with IE and Netscape. If you find
that other clients don't like this, I can tighten it down some. 

BTW, this effect will apply to the PURL server as well if you create PURLs
to XML documents. There's not much that can be done to fix this, though,
because the PURL server doesn't have control of the ContentType of the
target the way I do in the ERRoL responses.

There is still room for improvement, so comments and suggestions are
welcome.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10310301548090.14044-100000@outtolunch.merit.edu>

i sent a message to the list some time ago and, while working on other
non-XML and non-OAI projects, i've been closing watching the list in hopes
of finding the solution to my encoding problem.  i'm embarrassed to admit
that this encoding problem remains.

perhaps i should provide some details...

DATA STORAGE:  Oracle
DATA DELIVERY:  DBI.pm
OAI CONSTRUCTOR:  Perl script (using Embperl)
WEB SERVER:  Apache

in other words, i have a single Perl script, in the form an Embperl file,
that draws the data from Oracle, via DBI, then i simply loop through the
data and wrap each element with the appropriate XML tag before returning
the whole mess through STDOUT.

i'm guessing that i should encode each character to UTF-8 as it passes
through the script, but as yet, i'm not sure how to best do this.

any helpful tips, advice, rants, etc. will be most welcome.  i thank you
in advance.

 -Todd

I strongly urge you to use a 5.8.x version of Perl, as it has built-in
support for UTF-8.

As you are outputting via STDOUT you should use:
binmode(STDOUT,":utf8");
Which is pretty self-explanatory :-)

You need to find out what character coding your data is in, and convert it
into UTF-8. e.g. if your data is in ISO-8859-1 ("Latin-1, West Europe") you
would do something like:

use Encode; # Functions for converting strings between encodings
use utf8; # Tell Perl that you are using UTF-8 in your program

$sth = DBI::connect(...)->prepare("SELECT FROM DB");
$sth->execute;
my ($str_latin) = $sth->fetchrow_array();

my $str_utf8 = decode("iso-8859-1",$str_latin);

print $str_utf8; # n.b. you will still need to escape <>"& in string data

__end__

UTF-8 also restricts control characters, so you may need to do something
like:
$str_utf8 =~ s/[\x00-\x08\x0b-\x0d\x0e-\x1f]//sg; # Remove all control
characters except newline (\n)

There are quite a few utility functions in Encode for handling encodings, so
is well worth taking a look at the help page.
(I gotcha I have noticed is Perl modules that are written in C may not flag
a string as UTF-8, even though the data is. There are methods in Encode for
changing this flag - but should be used with caution!)

All the best,
Tim.

It appears that the "text/html" trick for HTTP redirects to XML data didn't
help with the Internet Explorer "access denied" problem . I've come to the
conclusion that I must sidestep the PURL server for this to work properly.
Consequently, I plan to have a new domain established (probably
errol.oclc.org) that should be used in place of purl.org when constructing
ERRoLs. The purl.org forms will continue to work, but will continue to be a
problem for IE. I'll let people know when the new domain is ready. Sorry for
the inconvenience.
