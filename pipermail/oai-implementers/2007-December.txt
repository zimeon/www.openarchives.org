Subject: [OAI-implementers] Some OAI-PMH protocol issues
Message-ID: <4756720C.6020405@ifremer.fr>

Hello,

Further to the previous email I sent about the document 
<http://www.ifremer.fr/docelec/doc/2007/acte-3238.pdf> we redacted to 
assess the main difficulties met during the first year of management of 
our Avano <http://www.ifremer.fr/avano/> harvester, I would like to 
focus, in this email, on just 3 problems linked to the OAI-PMH protocol, 
Dublin Core or to repositories implementation. I would like to focus 
particularly on these 3 problems because I guess they should not be so 
difficult to fix.  


*Managing duplicates *

Too many duplicates in a result list in Harvesters list can affect the 
user's comfort. This is not the main problem harvesters are facing 
today, but this should increase in the coming years. Today, at least two 
phenomenons can generate duplicates in the harvesters' databases: 

    * Several research organisations or universities can record the same
      electronic resource in their own institutional repository. If
      Avano harvests those repositories, it will get descriptive index
      files of the same topic stored in several places. This can happen
      if, for example, a publication is written in collaboration with
      several institutions. If so, this publication may be archived on
      the server of each institution. Considering the current low
      auto-archiving rate, especially in life sciences, this phenomenon
      is not the main cause of the production of duplicates.
    * Projects for national or thematic aggregators can pose problem. In
      some countries, projects of merged institutional repositories can
      agregate records from a selection of repositories in a centralised
      database before displaying them again in OAI-PMH on their own
      server. As a consequence, records referenced on those servers are
      displayed twice in OAI-PMH: via the institutional repository and
      via the centralised database. If the manager of an harvester does
      not know about the architecture of those national or thematic
      projects, he may record the two different servers and generate
      duplicates in his harvester's result lists. 

/To help harvesters administrator to avoid recording repositories 
generating duplicates, could we imagine adding to the description of the 
repository information about the involvement of the said repository in a 
national or thematic agregation system that would reexpose the records 
in OAI-PMH from a different server?
/

*Managing Type and Date field*

As far as I understand, in order to comply with the OAI-PMH protocol, 
repositories have to expose their data in the non-qualified Dublin Core 
DTD. In this DTD all fields are optional. Those fields are also 
non-qualified, meaning, for example, that they do not have to correspond 
to an enclosed value list. This optional and non-formalised information 
trait raises several issues, especially for the Type field.

Indeed, even if the Dublin Core DTD recommends storing the Type 
information by using standardised text strings, few repositories take 
this into consideration and still present the information as free text 
(ex: publication, artjournal, text, article are used to describe an 
article). Some harvesters, including Avano, offer their users to limit 
their search to one or several types of resources. To set up this 
filter, harvesters try to standardise the Type field using a system 
based on key-word recognition in this character string. This 
standardising is therefore imperfect and the filter system may exclude 
resources from the result list when a user narrows his search to one or 
several types of specific data. Some informations contained in this Type 
field cannot be standardised.

Even more problematic is the fact that some repositories do not fill in 
this field. As an example, in September 2007, out of the 107.000 records 
available in Avano, more than 26.000 did not have a Type field. All of 
those records are automatically barred from the search space if a user 
limits is search to one or several selected types.
 
/Could it be possible to imagine getting a new normalised and mandatory 
information about the type of the digital object (text, image, 
video....) so harvesters could offer an reliable option to filter one or 
several types ob objects from the end-user search.
/
The publication date is also problematic for harvester. For example, In 
September 2007, out of the 107.000 records available in Avano, about 
15.000 did not have a publication date. When a record does not have a 
publication date or when it cannot be standardised, it is automatically 
located at the end of the list if the user wants the results to be 
sorted by date. In the same way, when a user limits his search to a 
specific period of time (see fig. 9), those files are barred from the 
search even if they correspond to the specified search. 

But I guess this problem with the publication date will be more 
difficult to fix because it is difficult to define it as mandatory.


*Records without free access to the digital object*

As far as I understand, the OAI-PMH protocol defines only the sharing 
process of bibliographical records contained in a group of repositories. 
As a consequence, some repositories mix records without links to the 
digital object together with records providing free access to the 
resource. Others provide records with paying access (ex : BePress) or 
records with restricted access, for example, for university staff. 

In my opinion, this is the major problem harvesters have to face today. 
There is no indication in the Dublin Core DTD showing the harvesters the 
degree of accessibility of the objects described in the records. As a 
consequence, harvesters cannot pass on this information to their users 
or provide them with the ability to filter empty records or records 
offering paying access to the resource.

It is my opinion that hiding records with free full text among records 
with inaccessible full text is not helpful. For lack of time and/or 
interest, scientists are reluctant to join the Open Access movement and 
the archiving rate of free access publications stays very low, 
especially in life sciences. Free and immediate access to documentation 
is, without doubt, the best way to convince the scientists of the 
interest of the Open Access movement. And drowning a minority of records 
providing free access publications in an ocean of records without link 
to the full text and/or records offering paying access to the documents 
may not be the best way to promote the Open Access movement.

Again, those records without free access to the full text would not be a 
problem for the harvesters if the Dublin Core DTD enabled to signify the 
harvesters the degree of accessibility of the objects described in the 
records. Harvesters could then provide their users with the possibility 
of filtering the records without free access to the digital object. But 
it is still not the case. 

/Could we then imagine that, in a possible future version of the 
OAI-PMH, each record will have to provide a normalised and mandatory 
information about the degree of accessibility of the digital object 
(free, paying, impossible, restricted,...)? This will help harvesters so 
much to provide a better service to theirs end-users.
/

What do you think?

Kind regards,
Fred

An answer from Jes?s L. Dom?nguez Muriel (jdmuriel@jdmuriel.com):

Hello,

[Due to a misconfiguration of my e-mail software, I cannot post directly 
to the oai-implementers list. If you find this information useful, 
please feel free to post it to the list]

Regarding problems 2 and 3, there is an European initiative called 
DRIVER which attempts to solve, among others, those problems.

DRIVER-conforming repositories must use certain values for date and type 
DC fields, and must include open-access full-text records within a 
specific OAI set. They should also implement an additional metadata 
format --DIDL-, which helps locate the associated full-text files, so 
that they can be easily accessed and collected.

You can find more information at http://www.driver-support.eu/en/index.html

My personal opinion is that these DRIVER guidelines should be refined 
and made clearer. I would have also preferred a different metadata 
format to specify associated files, because DIDL is too generic and a 
bit confusing. Maybe the future OAI-ORE could be used instead of DIDL. 
Anyway, it is a starting point and deserves some study.

 >>>>> There is a way to indicate potential overlaps in the repository 
description, as free text for instance. HAL is in this situation 
(document located in 2 different reps), that's the solution being 
considered beside contacting SP and telling them :-) Any better solution 
welcome.
If there is a harvest then re-exposure of the records, the About section 
of the individual records should indicate the provenance of the original 
record. This should allow deduplication. In practice, I'm not certain SP 
do that very often though.

guidelines are a first step for scholarly info. see also DLF Best

 >>>>>> Guidelines again, that can be recorded in DC:Rights field. 
DRIVER guidelines proposed the creation of specific sets in the case you 
are mentioning. NEREUS people are enforcing the encoding of 
ContextObjects in a QDC record to help this. Not sure any of this is 
perfect. Finally, there always the possibility to request scholarly 
communciation repositories to share richer metadata formats and/or to 
indicate accessRights in links to different versions of digital objects. 
That could be guidelines'job or ORE job or other formats's job.

I don't think that these are OAI-PMH data transport issues, but  
application issues that arise from the interpretation and usage of  
metadata from heterogenous data providers.

Managing duplicates: while it makes life inconvenient for your service  
users, it is not something that can in general be controlled by  
independent data providers. I'm afraid that your service must have the  
ability to reconcile duplicate (or near duplicate) items.

Controlled vocabularies for types: you will need to make a  
recommendation and try to gain support among the OAI data providers. I  
am not sure that the selection that you propose will work in practice.  
Is a PDF a text if it has embedded images? Is an image a text if it is  
an OCR scan?

Enforced publication dates: what do you enforce if the item has never  
been officially published?

Dear Les,

Thank you for your answer. It is clear that it is not really OAI-PMH 
issues but rather application issues.

However about vocabularies for types, an extra field information with 
one or several selections in the DCMI Type Vocabulary 
<http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/> , for example, 
will be so much useful. Even it is true that no recommendation will be 
perfect and there will be always exception that will not match it in a 
controlled list. 

For managing duplicates, I was really thinking about national 
aggregators. The French archive HAL is a good example. You can get all 
the records for the HAL OAI server, or you can get a part of them 
through institutional repositories server such as HAL-IN2P3 OAI server, 
HAL-INSERM OAI server. So if the manager of an harvester does not know 
about the architecture of those national or thematic projects, he may 
record the two different servers and generate duplicates in his 
harvester?s result lists. This is the same for BePress server. You can 
load all institutional repositories managed by BePress separately or all 
in one time through the general BePress OAI server. I know there is a 
ARROW project in Australia that harvest institutional repositories and 
re-expose records in its own server. Once again the description of the 
repository information about the involvement of the said repository in a 
national or thematic aggregation system that would re-expose the records 
in OAI-PMH from a different server could be useful in some cases.

And I agree there is no solution for dates?

What do you think about Records without free access to the digital 
object issues? Could the addition of a normalised and mandatory 
information about the degree of accessibility of the digital object be a 
OAI-PMH issues for a possible future versions?

Anyway, thanks again for your attention and for your answer.

Kind regards,
Fred

Message-ID: <4759299D020000350002AF4E@ntgwgate.loc.gov>

Frederic,

Les, Muriel, and Jesus are right.  These are not issues with the protocol, but with how it is used and the metadata practices behind the records.  And none of them are new.  They are HARD problems. Much as one might hope for a consensus, attempts to develop stricter rules for metadata across all communities have failed repeatedly.  There is a reason that the "simple" Dublin Core elements are all optional and repeatable.  Within communities, progress has been made.

Muriel mentioned the DLF/NSDL Best Practices for Shareable Metadata.  Here are links.
  http://www.diglib.org/architectures/oai/imls2004/training/MetadataFinal.pdf
  http://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/oaibp/?MetadataContent

In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that both Muriel and I were involved in this activity.  I believe it distills wisdom gleaned from a great deal of experience. Given your topical interest, the NSDL Metadata Primer from the National Science Digital Library (a project funded by the US National Science Foundation) may be relevant.
http://metamanagement.comm.nsdlib.org/outline.html

It's worth keeping on highlighting the issues to try and promote better practices.  

On the issue of TYPE: 
All guidelines I have seen recommend at least one "type" value from a controlled list, but this is an area where communities and service providers may have very different idea of what is needed beyond that.  For example, the DRIVER guidelines assume the objects described are textual and provide a short list of more specific terms considered adequate for the objects in scope.  The NSDL guideline is to include one term from the DCMI type vocabulary plus more specific terms as appropriate.  What the Library of Congress tries to do with its digitized historical material in American Memory follows that practice: assign both a high-level type (e.g. text, still image, as in the DCMI type vocabulary) and something more specific.  Various vocabularies are used for the more specific vocabularies, from the Thesaurus for Graphic Materials (http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/tgmhtml/tgmabt.html) with 650 terms for types of visual materials to Basic Genre Terms for Cultural Heritage Materials (http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/techdocs/genre.html) which is a small, somewhat ad hoc, set of terms based on the content in American Memory (much of which comes from collections of personal or organizational papers and ethnographic folklife collections).

The ePrints Type vocabulary [http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Eprints_Type_Vocabulary_Encoding_Scheme] is another vocabulary with a focussed (but very widely applicable) scope.

Service providers will have to make decisions about things like: (a) how much work to do with the records they harvest to improve the situation; (b) whether to try and filter out duplicates; (c) when to throw records out; and (d) whether to work with the organizations they most want to harvest from, either one-on-one or to make some community guidelines that improve the situation.  

You might want to see if you can find out what strategies other service providers in similar domains have used for dealing with Type and Date.

PS  FWIW, a book chapter my husband and I wrote for Metadata in Practice, edited by Diane Hillmann and Elaine Westbrooks, and published by  ALA Editions in 2004, attempts to explain why heterogeneous metadata is a fact of life.

I don't think that these are OAI-PMH data transport issues, but  
application issues that arise from the interpretation and usage of  
metadata from heterogenous data providers.

Managing duplicates: while it makes life inconvenient for your service  
users, it is not something that can in general be controlled by  
independent data providers. I'm afraid that your service must have the  
ability to reconcile duplicate (or near duplicate) items.

Controlled vocabularies for types: you will need to make a  
recommendation and try to gain support among the OAI data providers. I  
am not sure that the selection that you propose will work in practice.  
Is a PDF a text if it has embedded images? Is an image a text if it is  
an OCR scan?

Enforced publication dates: what do you enforce if the item has never  
been officially published?

Subject: [OAI-implementers] metadata utilities
Message-ID: <4759B0E5.8000109@cs.odu.edu>

Greetings All -

We are implementing a modification to the Apache OAI-PMH module, 
"mod_oai", which will automatically pass a resource through several 
metadata utilities. We are looking for good utility candidates to 
experiment with. Requirements for a candidate utility include:

1) must have a "command-line" mode (i.e., not a GUI)
2) must be installable on a Linux-OS (Java is OK)
3) must not require interactive-input other than the name of the file to 
be processed
4) output should be either XML, plain text, or HTML (delimited data is 
OK, but no application-dependent output including PDF).

Ideally, the utility will have a very straightforward installation 
process. Jhove and Open Text Summarizer are examples of this. An example 
of a too-hard installation is KEA (Automated Keyphrase Analyzer) because 
the set up requires a "training" process and things like author-defined 
index terms. Our experiment will mimic sites which do not have 
librarians or metadata specialists, but which do have a wide variety of 
file types -- e.g., university departmental web servers.

Currently installed utilites are:

1) Jhove
2) Open Text Summarizer
3) Exif Tool
4) Hashes (MD5, SHA-1, etc.)
5) File Magic
6) [Essence -- maybe; in progress]
7) DROID

We would really like to have a Dublin Core utility, but haven't found a 
working, non-interactive tool yet.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions you can give me,

Joan

Subject: [OAI-implementers] University of Michigan Announces Open-Source OAI
	Toolkit
Message-ID: <C3842BD7.10A6D%khage@umich.edu>

The University of Michigan Libraries is pleased to announce the release of
their open-source OAI toolkit on SourceForge. This toolkit contains both
harvester and data provider, both written in Perl.

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/umoaitoolkit/
 
UMHarvester is a robust tool using LWP for harvesting nigh on every OAI data
provider available. It allows for incremental harvesting, has multiple
re-try options, and a batch harvest tool (Batch_UMHarvest) that can
automatically perform incremental harvesting.
 
UMProvider relies heavily on libxml (XML::LibXML) and will store the data in
nearly any relational database. It functions by harvesting from a database
of records, making rights determinations from a separate database, and
providing the resulting set of records.
 
Originally, only the UMHarvester was available from UM's DLXS software site.
The UMProvider tool is newly developed and takes the place of our DLXS data
provider tool.
 
One of the benefits of developing UMProvider was our ability to ingest and
make available the records of MBooks texts being digitized by Google at the
University of Michigan Libraries.

    http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/o/oai/oai?verb=Identify
 
Currently, only MBooks records available in the public domain are exposed,
and we have split these into sets containing public domain items according
to copyright law in the United States, and public domain items worldwide.
There are currently over 100,000 records. We anticipate having 1 million
records available when the entire U-M collection has been digitized by
Google.
 
    http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/o/oai/oai?verb=ListSets
 
We plan to move the texts available through our previous UM Libraries data
provider (http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/b/broker20/broker20/) into
UMProvider over the coming year.

We would recommend harvesting the MBooks records using the re-try option on
your harvester to avoid timeouts.

For questions about the project, please contact dlps-help@umich.edu.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] release of alpha OAI-ORE documents
Message-ID: <475EF87F.9030901@lanl.gov>

Dear all,

We are pleased to announce the public alpha release of the OAI Object 
Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) User Guide and Specification documents. 
These are now available at http://openarchives.org/ore/toc.

These documents are the result of over a year of effort by a large group 
of people. We now seek your feedback on their contents, as part of our 
effort to transition these documents to beta and then final production 
release.

We have set up a Google Group to discuss these documents. We welcome 
your comments there, and request your help in keeping these comments and 
the resulting discussion productive and focused. The URL of the Google 
Group is http://groups.google.com/group/oai-ore. You will also find this 
URL in the header note in the OAI-ORE documents.

You may also send mail to ore@openarchives.org, but we request you use 
this only for private comments to the editors. Our goal is to keep this 
discussion public.

Finally, we'd like to remind you of two upcoming events related to OAI-ORE:

1. March 3rd 2008, John Hopkins University: USA ORE Open Meeting. 
Register at http://www.regonline.com/oai-ore (limited to 150). Supported 
by Microsoft.

2. April 4th 2008, University of Southampton: European ORE Open Meeting. 
In conjunction with Open Repositories 2008. Registration not yet 
available. Supported by JISC.

Greetings

Carl Lagoze & Herbert Van de Sompel on behalf of the OAI-ORE effort

Message-ID: <89D12171D3EA6E48900F2B7BF14864EA0E18308253@iu-mssg-mbx06.ads.iu.edu>

Hello all,

We're planning a big move to a new OAI provider, and will take this opportunity to provide a clean break from some questionable and unsustainable practices that have cropped up in our existing provider. We're wondering how to handle OAI identifiers in our new system, though. Identifiers in our local repository start with a /, e.g., /lilly/slocum/LL-SLO-000024. Would it be OK for our OAI identifier for this item to be:

oai:oai.dlib.indiana.edu:/lilly/slocum/LL-SLO-000024

...or would that slash at the beginning of the local part be a problem? That is, would this be better?

oai:oai.dlib.indiana.edu:lilly/slocum/LL-SLO-000024

I didn't see anything in the Guidelines for Repository Implementers <http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-repository.htm> or the DLF/NSDL Best Practices on this issue <http://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/oaibp/index.php/OAIidentifiersAndRegistrationSection> that indicated the slash would be a problem, but it's possible I missed something.

Thanks!

Jenn

The syntax for the identifier is given here:
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-oai-identifier.htm

As far as I can see, a slash can occur anywhere within the 
local-identifier part, so you should be ok.

Thanks, all, for the responses, both on and off-list. Looks like we're safe to use our native identifiers, with the leading "/".
