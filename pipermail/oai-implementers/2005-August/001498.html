<PRE>Speaking from the perspective of a nascent service provider, I would  
have to say &quot;the more the merrier&quot; when it comes to exposing metadata  
via OAI-PMH. As a service provider, I can make my own choices as to  
which metadata format I prefer to harvest, and having a much richer  
schema (albeit one that may take some review and post-processing for  
my particular purposes), is still desirable over having no choice at  
all. Having said that, I would say that I would prefer to have the  
metadata exposed as separate descriptive metadata packages if  
possible rather than in a METS wrapper, since as you know the METS  
wrapper adds complexity. Specifically, I mean the data provider might  
offer three different schemas for the metadata:

1) the required simple DC
2) a qualified DC
3) MODS

as an example. This would allow me as a service provider to easily  
consume the metadata without first having to &quot;unpack&quot; and understand  
your particular METS profile. Especially since we are putting the  
metadata into our own METS profile on our end ;-). My two cents, for  
what it's worth.

</I>&gt;<i> This issue has been skirted in a few previous mails.  Right now,  
</I>&gt;<i> DSpace
</I>&gt;<i> can expose metadata about complex objects via its OAI-PMH data  
</I>&gt;<i> provider

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One problem of course is that since METS is essentially an envelope  
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> other kinds of metadata, it's pretty pointless to just say &quot;I support
</I>&gt;<i> METS&quot;.  It's one step further than &quot;I support XML&quot; but to get
</I>&gt;<i> interoperability you need to go quite a bit further.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, as an OAI-PMH service provider (or a tool hoping to do
</I>&gt;<i> some resource harvesting/mirroring) I can't just ask for the metadata
</I>&gt;<i> prefix &quot;mets&quot; and hope to understand what comes out.  E.g. will it  
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> qualified DC in it, or MODS?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps, rather than by namespace/schema, I really need to specify by
</I>&gt;<i> profile (and in the case of DSpace even that's not likely to be  
</I>&gt;<i> uniform
</I>&gt;<i> across the board).  Should I be using a metadataPrefix like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mets_dspace&quot; or somesuch?  Just using &quot;mets&quot; might be setting an
</I>&gt;<i> expectation of interoperability/understandability that just isn't  
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, using &quot;mets_dspace&quot; might be removing a possibility
</I>&gt;<i> -- if I expose METS which has qualified Dublin Core in it, a harvester
</I>&gt;<i> might at least be able to extract and use that, even if it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> understand some of the other metadata embedded in the METS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another issue is whether having multiple schemas in harvested  
</I>&gt;<i> records is
</I>&gt;<i> going to cause a problem for harvesters.  Even in the simple case of
</I>&gt;<i> METS with some qualified DC in it, there's the METS and QDC  
</I>&gt;<i> schemas.  I
</I>&gt;<i> don't have enough experience on the harvester/service provider side of
</I>&gt;<i> things to know whether this will cause headaches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this pushing really beyond what OAI-PMH was designed for?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All thoughts/comments welcomed...
