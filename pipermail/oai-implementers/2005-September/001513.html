<PRE>Announcement [crossposted]

First Workshop on Eprints in Library and Information Science

22 October, 2005 from 13:45 to 19:00
Council Chamber, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

The workshop takes place right after the CERN workshop on Innovations
in Scholarly Communication OAI4 <A HREF="http://oai4.web.cern.ch/OAI4/.">http://oai4.web.cern.ch/OAI4/.</A> It
is sponsored by CERN, CILEA and the Polytechnic University of Valencia.
The meeting is followed by a reception. 

The workshop is for activists, friends and folks who want to find out
more about the E-LIS eprints archive for Library and Information
Science (LIS), at <A HREF="http://eprints.rclis.org.">http://eprints.rclis.org.</A>  E-LIS was formed in 2003
to further the open archiving of papers in LIS and related fields. It
is an open-access international eprints archive maintained by
volunteers. It has grown spectacularly well. At the time of writing
almost 3000 eprints have been archived.

At the workshop the E-LIS community will discuss technical details of
E-LIS and organizational models for the E-LIS community. Outsiders
will find it interesting to see how a really successful open archive
works.  Some efforts that are related to E-LIS will also be discussed.
This workshop will be an important contribution to the development of
open archiving within LIS scholarly communication.

Registration for this event is free, but limited to to the first 150
people. See the workshop web site at

for further details and online registration.
