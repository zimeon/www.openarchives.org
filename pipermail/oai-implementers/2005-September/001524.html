Sorry, I was confused, probably due to caffeine deficiency: what I 
(should have) meant to say is: you could do this with a thin xslt layer 
that takes the xml output of the UKDA server and transforms it to DDI, 
*or* you could set up a small intermediary server that harvests UKDA and 
outputs DDI, but this would have nothing to do with xslt.

I'll be having a coffee now.
