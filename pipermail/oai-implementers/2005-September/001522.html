<PRE>We are currently using a piece of open-source software called the 
Virtual Data Center (VDC) from Harvard that implements a complete 
digital library system for numeric data - e.g. social sciences 
quantitative research data (<A HREF="http://thedata.org/index.php/Main/AboutVDC">http://thedata.org/index.php/Main/AboutVDC</A>). 
Whilst the system provides extensive support for federated and 
distributed collections it will currently only provide federated search 
functionality for  records in other VDC  systems however it will harvest 
metadata from other systems that implement OAI.

We would like to make the system search the UK Data Archive (UKDA) - as 
the UKDA does not use VDC we are looking at being able to harvest their 
records. The UKDA have a test OAI service but this only contains a 
reduced Dublin Core record for each of their catalogue entries and it 
seems that the VDC system will only harvest DDI metadata. Has any body 
got any experience of what would be needed to harvest DC records and put 
them into DDI. At first glance it seems that DC and DDI map pretty well.

Any advice on how this would be done and how much work it would take 
would be much appreciated.

Kate
