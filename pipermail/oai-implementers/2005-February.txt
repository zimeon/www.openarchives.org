Message-ID: <5.2.1.1.1.20050202101334.00997080@imap-server.ucl.ac.uk>

Hi,

I'm implementing OAI-PMH and at first I decided that my system could easily 
return 2000 records in a single OAI-PMH request. Unfortunately the "OAI 
Repository Explorer" doesn't seem to be able to cope with that much data 
since it ended up having timeout and too-much-data errors.

I've now reduced that number to 500 and my repository now validates 
happily. But is there a rule of thumb for how many records it's "polite" to 
return, or how many a typical OAI-PMH harvester "expects" to have to deal with?

Thanks
Dan

OAI-PMH has a flow control mechanism [1], which, if followed, allows the 
use of a resumptionToken for handling larger data sets. This is widely 
implemented in OAI tools.

Thanks - but yes, I'm aware of the resumptionToken - I just wanted to know 
whether there's a de facto standard for how many records to return in a 
single response, before giving the resumptionToken.

Best,
Dan

as I know the de fact standard is 100 records.

hi Dan

i dont think there is a de facto standard ... but i recall some people a 
while back saying responses should not exceed about 1MB in size because 
of limitations of popular XML processing tools

if your responses are about that size and the RE does not accept them, 
let me know and ill increase the limits ...

ttfn,
----hussein

ps. personally, i think 500 records is fine

Hussein,

Thanks for this - my 500-record responses are about half a megabyte, so 
that's probably a good size to go with.

(It implies that my 2000-record responses were about 2MB, causing the RE to 
choke.)

Dan

Message-ID: <0560FE30E308454280C10066BBC4554C01AA4FCA@iu-mssg-mbx05.exchange.iu.edu>

Hello all-

I'm part of a group within the Digital Library Federation writing a set
of Best Practices for shareable metadata via OAI. One of our goals is to
develop best practices for specific classes of metadata elements, rather
than writing them for elements in any specific metadata schema (e.g.,
DC). But first we need to define those classes.

I'd like to ask OAI service providers out there what metadata elements
you combine together for searching or browsing, in order to help us
define what higher-level element classes we should be describing. Do
you, for example, combine dc.creator, dc.contributor, and dc.publisher
into a single index (And what do you call it?)? Pull temporal values
from dc.coverage and index them together with dc.date? Put dc.title,
dc.description, and dc.subject together for a "title"-ish index? What
combinations do you currently use and what have you considered but don't
currently implement? If you're harvesting metadata in something other
than DC, or using something other than DC on your SP back end, we'd be
interested in hearing about elements you combine from these schemas as
well. 

Thanks in advance for the feedback - I look forward to seeing what
people out there are doing.

Jenn

I have had arXiv.org's OAI interface sending replies of around 1MB
(actually up to about 1.5) for some time and no one has told me of any
problems with the reply size.

Cheers,
Simeon

I'm taking the liberty of copying a message to the dspace-tech list here,
since I propose the use of the HTML <link> tag and I know that my previous
suggestions about using this tag on this list have only received a
luke-warm response! :-)

These suggestions stem from the need for Google robots to auto-discover
the OAI BASEURL for any given repository.

So I'd be interested in thoughts on my suggestions below - particularly on
whether we need something like an 'application/oai+xml' MIME type
registration (to say that the XML conforms to one of the responses in the
OAI-PMH).

No, not really!  Clearly the 'well known location' approach (like
robots.txt) works well in many cases, but it is not without problems -
particularly for those people who want to run repositories on servers
where they don't have access to create a file (or whatever) at the chosen
location.

More importantly, I think that any agreements that you (the DSpace
community) reach with Google need to scale not just to all DSpace users,
but to those who choose to offer their repositories using other software
(like eprints.org) and even to those who choose to base their repositories
on more mainstream technologies like content management systems.

So, I don't think that a 'DSpace well known location' is the right
approach.  I offer two alternatives, neither of which is particularly well
thought thru - but these ideas might be a useful basis for further
refinement?

1) Embed a <link rel="oaipmh" ...> tag into the <head> section of the
repository home page, linking to the BASEURL of the OAI server for that
repository (note, there is no requirement that the BASEURL is on the same
Web server as the repository itself - this is a completely open linking
mechanism).  E.g.

<link rel="oaipmh" type="application/xml"  title="OAI BASEURL"
href="http://etheses.nottingham.ac.uk/perl/oai2" />

2) Embed a <link rel="meta" ...> tag into the <head> section of each
eprint's 'jump-off' page (sorry, my terminology is probably wrong in the
context of DSpace here), linking to an OAI GetRecord request for the
metadata about the current eprint.  E.g.

<link rel="meta" type="application/xml" title="OAI/DC Metadata"
href="http://etheses.nottingham.ac.uk/perl/oai2?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai%3Aetheses.nottingham.ac.uk.OAI2%3A1"
/>

Option 1 has the advantage of being OAI-specific (but not
DSpace-specific), i.e. the Google robot (or any other robot for that
matter) would know that it would have to deal with the OAI protocol at the
end of a rel="oaipmh" link.

Option 2 has the advantage of being in line with existing conventions
(e.g. DCMI recommendations) for linking from an HTML page to some metadata
about that page.  However, it would probably benefit from a more specific
MIME type, e.g. application/oai+xml, which doesn't exist yet AFAIK.

Given that the 'jump-off' page is generated dynamically by the system (I
assume) there is no significant overhead with option 2 (in terms of having
to manually embed lots of link tags).

Clearly, both approaches could be used in tandem.  However, given minimal
knowledge about the workings of the OAI protocol, it would be possible for
the Google robots to work out the BASEURL of a repository having seen the
first of the GetRecord URLs embedded in option 2.  Therefore, option 1
might be unnecessary if option 2 is being used.

Thoughts?

(this is in response to Andy's mesg:
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2005-February/001407.html)

Drawing from our experience with mod_oai, we see at least 4 possible
ways for robots to "automatically" discover OAI-PMH baseURLs:

1.  develop a separate file, oaimph.txt, similar in spirit to robots.txt

2.  add to the existing robots.txt file

3.  use HTML link or META tags for robots

4.  use the <friends> component in the Identify response.

We do not prefer #1 - a separate file for robots to check seems unlikely
to encourage widespread adoption.

We prefer #2 because it injects OAI-PMH into the regular web
mechanics where it belongs.  Robots already look for this file -
why not put OAI-PMH statements where they expect to find guidance?
Similarly, a robots.txt file is easy to install and edit (certainly
easier than installing most repository software packages), so there
will be no additional burden on a repository administrator.

#3 can be used in some cases, but it makes an assumption that every
repository we would like a robot to find has an HTML presence.  #2 and #3
can be used separately since they address separate use cases.

#4 is important and needs to be reinforced as a way of repositories
"pointing" to each other.  You can't bootstrap baseURL discovery via
<friends>, but once a robot knows about a single baseURL, it should be
able to assemble a list of cooperating repositories.  No new functionality
is needed for <friends>, but the robot scenario increases the importance
of its use.

robots.txt
----------

The "problem" with robots.txt is that the syntax is very simple and is
focused on telling robots what they can't do and not on what they should
do.  So in addition to having a line such as:

OAIPMHbaseURL: http://cs1.ist.psu.edu/cgi-bin/oai.cgi

We would like to expand the syntax of the "Disalllow:" tag to include
alternatives:

Disallow: /citations/ OAIPMHbaseURL:
http://cs1.ist.psu.edu/cgi-bin/oai.cgi

Where the 2nd line is the alternate access for how to get at the
information prohibited in the Disallow.  Depending on how robust
robots are with respect to extended syntax, we could repeat the line
in case the extended line is not understood:

Disallow: /citations/
Disallow: /citations/  OAIPMHbaseURL:
http://cs1.ist.psu.edu/cgi-bin/oai.cgi

HTML Tags for Robots
--------------------

It would be useful to tie an existing HTML page back to the original
OAI-PMH repository from which it came, such as:

http://uk.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502028

having something like:

<META NAME="ROBOTS" OAIPMHbaseURL="http://www.arxiv.org/oai2">

It would also be useful to tie the HTML representation back to
the structured metadata from which it came:

<META NAME="ROBOTS"
OAIPMHrecord="http://www.arxiv.org/oai2?verb=GetRecord&metad
ataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai:arXiv.org:astro-ph/0502028">

<META NAME="ROBOTS"
OAIPMHrecord="http://www.arxiv.org/oai2?verb=GetRecord&metad
ataPrefix=oai_marc&identifier=oai:arXiv.org:astro-ph/0502028">

This is similar to inverse of a DC.Identifier field -- instead of mapping
from structured to un/semi-strucutred, it maps from un/semi-strucutred
to structured.

I agree with your conclusion that it is sensible to adopt both approaches
#2 and #3.

I'm not sure what mechanisms are available for updating the REP though?
The REP pages are at

http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html

and the original REP author (I think) is Martijn Koster

http://www.greenhills.co.uk/mak/mak.html

The spec looks very... err... stable?!

I disagree with your implied preference for using <meta> rather than
<link>.  In this case, we clearly want to provide a link to another
resource - therefore the semantics of the <link> tag are much more
appropriate than the semantics of the <meta> tag.

I also suspect that your suggested use of

OAIPMHbaseURL="..."

and

OAIPMHrecord="..."

break the (X)HTML specs (though I haven't checked)?

May not need to change, but just restarted, and driven by the community.

Using the last rfc would not break anything, and would allow for the  
easy specification of the information
  http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots-rfc.html

Add a standard harvester name, and use the proposed allow extension to  
specify the path.

     User-agent: OAIPMHbaseURL
      Allow:   /path_to_oai

The rules should be written so that if your harvester has a user agent  
which is disallowed, then you should honor that request.

you are correct -- they do.

re: meta vs. link...  We don't have a strong opinion either way, but I did
see this:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xhtml2-20040722/mod-meta.html#sec_20.5.

"This element defines a link. Link conveys relationship information that
may be rendered by user agents in a variety of ways (e.g., a tool-bar with
a drop-down menu of links)."

I know <link> is not in common use, but it appears like the intention is
to promote it to interactive user status?  If so, wouldn't that be the
wrong thing to do with a (for example) GetRecord request?

if we really want to provide robots with a link from html -> OAI-PMH
metadata, don't we run the risk of exposing OAI-PMH requests to the user?

does anyone have any insight in to why this draft did not become an rfc?
I've poked around a variety of robots.txt files, and I don't see any use
of "Allow:" -- perhaps I've just missed them?

Either way, the Allow syntax as proposed does not "feel right".  Largely
due to the limited syntax of the existing robots.txt, the dependence on
the order of the lines is greatly increased.  Consider a site that has
content corresponding to 2 different baseURLs:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /a
Disallow: /b

It would be nice to bind these relative URIs to their original location,
something like:

OAI-PMH-baseURL: /a http://foo.org/oai
OAI-PMH-baseURL: /b http://bar.edu/perl/oai

those localizing the impact of the new syntax: 1 new line vs. a reserved
word for User-Agent & and a new line (which may have implication outside
of OAI-PMH).  if we wanted to bind the entire site to a single repo, we
could just:

OAI-PMH-baseURL: / http://xyz.edu/oai.cgi

Possibly, though I note that the same document also says this in section
20.2.2

 Note that just because we are using URIs as unique identifiers doesn't
 mean that navigating to this URI with a web browser would yield anything
 useful.

which doesn't seem entirely compatible with the section you quote from!

Remember that this document is about XHTML 2.0, which is not finalised.

On the other hand, section 5.19 of

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/

(which I think is the appropriate W3C recommendation) says

 The Link Module defines an element that can be used to define links to
 external resources. These resources are often used to augment the user
 agent's ability to process the associated XHTML document.

which doesn't (to me) imply that the browser should necessarily expect to
display the <link> to the end user (i.e. "augment" could mean other
things).  In our case, the 'user agent' is a Web robot, which is being
'augmented in its ability to process the document' by being pointed to the
OAI repository (or specific OAI record)  associated with the page.

Having said that, I know that some browsers do display all <link> tags to
the end-user in some form (e.g. Lynx and Opera I think).  This has
resulted in a couple of negative comments about one of the DCMI
recommendations ("Encoding DC metadata in (X)HTML meta and link
elements").  Dublin Core recommends using a <link> tag to provide the
namespace URI associated with the "DC." prefix used in <meta> tags like

<meta name="DC.title" content="blah" />

and I know that a couple of people have complained that their browsers
show them the namespace URI as though it is a clickable link :-(

All in all I'm not sure what is best.  I think that the semantics of
<link> are appropriate, but given some browser behaviour it may be more
sensible to use <meta>.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Should OAI-PMH over HTTPS be permitted?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0502161134340.23148@dhcp103-124.cs.cornell.edu>


There has been some interest recently in using OAI-PMH over HTTPS [1]. The
OAI-PMH specification [2] mentions only operation over HTTP, so I think
that at present HTTP must be used to conform to the specification (and
this is enforced by the validation/registration site). The specification
should be explicit about whether the use of HTTPS is conforming or not.

It would be trivial to extend the specification to permit the use of HTTPS
as it is just standard HTTP operating over an additional security layer.
There would be no need to change the semantics or syntax beyond the
substitution of 'https://' for 'http://'. Permitting HTTPS would have no
implications for data-providers unless they wished to use the protocol.
The main implication of permitting HTTPS would be that harvesters would
have to support HTTPS in addition to HTTP (or else be unable to harvest
from some data-providers). In many programming environments there are
libraries that provide seamless support for both HTTPS and HTTP (e.g. in
Perl, HTTPS comes for free in LWP) but this may not be true in all cases.

Who is using or would like to use HTTPS?

Which harvesters already support HTTPS or could easily do so?

Which harvesters could not easily support HTTPS?

Cheers,
Simeon

Until today we didn't have https support. As Simeon says, for perl-based
harvesters it's a simple matter of incorporating the appropriate perl
library.

mine :) anything i distribute is meant to be as "dependency-free" as 
possible. historically, LWP has not been the easiest module to get 
working on a variety of architectures, so i don't use it.

if we require every harvester to support HTTPS, this will become the 
first feature that programmers will need to support through external 
code libraries. as such we will raise the "low barrier to entry" 
substantially.

i agree we should explicitly support HTTPS, but not require it.

Because of the underlying APIs that we use (WinHTTP and MSXML), the 
harvester that we use at UIUC supports HTTPS.  I agree with Hussein that 
harvesters should be explicitly encouraged to support HTTPS, but it 
should not be a requirement of the protocol.

Maybe some advice on this topic could be added to the "Implementation 
Guidelines" documents.

A related issue: if Static Repository Files would also be accessible via
HTTPS, then constructing a OAI-PMH Gateway would be problematic because
gateways URL's don't contain the scheme of the original file location. 
E.g.

                                   ,-HTTP-OR-HTTPS-?-. 
http://www.gateway.org/somescript/www.university.edu/sr_file.xml?verb=Identify

I don't know if other types of gateways have the same problems.

I don't think this is an issue Patrick. Even if HTTPS is permitted for
OAI-PMH, the SR spec still only talks about HTTP for the Static Repository
URL [1] (the XML files). I think it should stay that way; the SR spec is,
after all, supposed to be the lowest barrier possible. The SRG would, in
principle, be able to use HTTP or HTTPS for its Static Repository Gateway
URL [2] although at present that is defined to be a HTTP URL.

I really think that the issue is just about harvesters which, in effect,
would _have_ to support HTTPS if it were permitted for baseURLs. Note that
that this isn't something where both are likely to be supported like GET
and POST. If a repo uses HTTPS and a harvester doesn't support it, then
that repo will be unharvestable by that harvester.

Cheers,
Simeon

I may have missed something here, but what is the *point* of OAI-PMH over 
HTTPS? Surely any OAI-PMH data is public, so there's no need at all to 
secure the channel?

I'd agree with the apparent consensus that HTTPS shouldn't be required of a 
harvester. However, my system ( http://myopia.sf.net ) is written in PHP 
which automatically includes HTTPS support so it could handle HTTPS with no 
code changes. (Currently it exposes an OAI interface; I'm developing OAI 
harvesting ability too.)

Best,
Dan

My guess is that there is no real intent behind these sites using https
-- if you deploy DSpace using Apache HTTPD + Tomcat (a common setup)
it's easy to just redirect everything to https: including the OAI-PMH
part.  If it's a problem, I'm sure you can contact the administrators of
those sites and they'll fix it.

That said, requiring OAI-PMH to be HTTP-based seems rather pointlessly
limiting to me -- you're instantly excluding any secure use of it.
OAI-PMH has applications outside of academic institutions wishing their
metadata to be as widely indexed as possible.

In terms of harvester tools supporting it, if I'm in a situation where I
need to have OAI-PMH used securely, I don't care -- I don't want just
anyone to be able to harvest my metadata, so I'll put up with needing
harvesters that support HTTPS for my application.

So perhaps we need to distinguish between what it means to be compliant
with OAI-PMH the protocol, and requirements to be part of the network of
academic/scholarly/"open" repositories and metadata sources that wish to
be as widely indexed as possible.

Message-ID: <19ADCC0B9D4CAD4582BB9900BBCE35742A4B54@tayexc13.americas.cpqcorp.net>

Lots of news sites use <link> to inform browsers etc. of an RSS feed,
e.g. news.bbc.co.uk, slashdot.org, theregister.co.uk, and the
Mozilla/Firefox browsers use this to allow 'live bookmarks'.  I'm sure
other tools use them too.

E.g. <link
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss0
91.xml" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="rss" />

This established practice seems pretty consistent with what we're trying
to do.  I could easily envisage an OAI-PMH Firefox extension that does
something with this...

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Up to 383 OA Archives now,
	159 of them GNU Eprints
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0502201750090.28919-100000@login.ecs.soton.ac.uk>

Dear Tim, Kat and OAI-implementers,

Several things.

First, I have done by hand the first imported set of OAI Base URLs
that Tim imported for me for
http://archives.eprints.org/eprints.php


It was worth the time and effort as not only did the
archive number rise to 363 and the Eprints subset to 159, but I
now have a good idea of the kinds of OAI-compliant archives there
are, and many of them are not relevant to OA: They are sites that have
merely made themselves OAI-compliant to increase their visibility.

That includes commercial product/service sites and University
Library catalgues and home pages -- both completely irrelevant
to OA and its goals (and introducing noise into OA-space:
Must remember: OAI is much, much wider than OA!).

Second, I would like to import more. What was that first list?
The UIUC registry (all of it?). 
http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/

What else can we now import.

One obvious one is all of OAIster: I will go over it all by hand
and remove all the archives that are not full-text OA content.
(Kat, could we have a file with all the OAIster archives
URLs and OAI BaseURLs? I can take it from there.)

Third, Tim, I'm not sure why the totals are not tallying in
the Registry: We have 159 institutional Archives now, but
your analysis only covers 90 of them: Is that because the rest
are not in celestial? But than please let us do something about
that, to get them in!

Also, of the 159 GNU Eprints Archives, only 120 are picked up
by your analysis: celestial again? Important to maximise 
celestial's coverage!

Last thing: There are 4 remaining archives in the buffer:

edoc.mpg.de (I have that already, and it says so, but I can't
remove it from the buffer)

nsdlib.nsdl.cornell.edu -- that might be an important one, but I
couldn't get a connection to verify it

www.auborn.edu -- that is one of those annoying ones that pop out
of the buffer automatically: I need a "safe" viewer even for
the buffer stage, as with such archives I cannot make them "dead"
as it stand!

www.numdam.org is, like mpg, already in the registry, and it
tells me so, but it won't let me remove it from the buffer!)

Please import more OAI baseURL lists as soon as you can, 
especially OAIster

(And any autjomatic checking you can get it to do -- to see
is we have it already and de-dupe, would sure help minimise
my time and keystrokes!)

Cheers, Stevan

Hi Steven,

The UIUC registry has a couple different groupings of OAI repositories 
that you might find useful:

   http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListVirtualColls.asp

The list includes OAIster, Eprints,and others.  The OAIster list is 
pretty up-to-date since I get a monthly feed from Kat.  However, the 
others are certainly out-of-date.

We are always willing to share records with other registries, so if 
there are any sorts of special export formats that might be useful let 
us know and we could attempt to accommodate.

We are actually starting to collect additional collection-level 
description for many of these repositories, and would be interested in 
what data people would find useful.

Kind regards,
	Tom Habing

Hi to all,

CILEA have done some patches for Celestial, an harvester written in perl.
Celestial is developed from Tim Brody.
The patches were written by Alessandro Tugnoli, test and debug was done by 
Zeno Tajoli.

You can download the code from

Attached is a text list of the baseURLs we include in OAIster, as of the
02/04 update. And their associated full repository names, per OAIster.

I'm not sure what you mean by OAIster archive URLs. For each repository,
you can search in OAISter on the full repository name and get all of the
records in the repository.

Daniel,

You should not include the illegal identifier in the <request> element.
The response you quote below is not schema valid because the 'identifier'
attribute of the <request> element is not a valid value for type 'anyURI'.

The OAI-PMH specification
[http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#XMLResponse]
says:

> The rules for generating the request element are as follows:
>   ...
>   o In cases where the request that generated this response resulted in
> a badVerb or badArgument error condition, the repository must return the
> base URL of the protocol request only. Attributes must not be provided
> in these cases.

Your response should include a badArgument error since the identifier
supplied is illegal (not just non-existent). Then the rule above applies
and your <request> element should be simply:

<request>http://www.ifeanet.org/phpoai2-1.5/php_oai/oai2.php</request>

Cheers,
Simeon

Just FYI...

Today I noticed a flurry of new data-provider registrations from
institutional repository sites running the Digital Commons product from
ProQuest. You can see a number of them on at
http://www.openarchives.org/Register/BrowseSites with repository names
"Digital Commons @ ..."

Also, last week saw what I think was the first Static Repository
data-provider registration: "Archeologia e Calcolatori - Published
Articles" at baseURL
http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ugent/lib/srepod/www.progettocaere.rm.cnr.it/databasegestione/A_C_oai_Archive.xml
which uses Patrick Hochstenbach's gateway at U. Ghent.

Cheers,
Simeon



PS. I have no connection with UMI/ProQuest.

The "Digital Commons" product from ProQuest is of course the  
bepress.com system, which has powered the eScholarship Repository  
<http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship/> for nearly three years.  
The California Digital Library, in fact, worked with bepress to develop  
a number of the features that now grace the product, including OAI  
support. As far as I know, it remains the only repository system with a  
full-featured online peer review system as an integrated part of the  
product.

On a side note, the eScholarship Repository recently passed the  
milestone of one million paper downloads (not web page views), and only  
this week announced a new "postprints" service that enables University  
of California faculty to upload a selected set of their published  
articles with a few clicks of the mouse button. Long live institutional  
repositories!

Dear Daniel, 

the problem is that the Protocol suggests to return the identifier in this 
error case. However the invalid identifier does not match 
the type oai:identifierType, so the generated XML is invalid.
 
So in fact it is a problem in either the specification or the XML Schema.

Two solutions are possible:

The XML Schema for Validating Responses to OAI-PMH Requests can be fixed
by just requiring any string and not an oai:identifierType.

OR

fix the file oaidp-util.php with this patch:

The last line of 3.2.3 in 
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html
should be changed to 

"In cases where the request that generated this response resulted in a 
badVerb or badArgument or idDoesNotExist error condition, the repository 
must return the base URL of the protocol request only. 
Attributes must not be provided in these cases."

I do not think that the data provider has to check the validity of the 
identifier so returning badArgument does not seem to make sense (and the
text does not suggest something like that.

I just read that the identfier MUST be an URI, so Simeon argument is 
better. So the identifier has to checked for consistency.., I will send
something soon.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Perl oai modules
Message-ID: <421F988F.7060309@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

Hi all,

I've uploaded a new version of my oai-perl libraries to CPAN, as HTTP-OAI.

These aren't related to Zeno's patches, which I'll eventually integrate 
into the changes I've made here with Celestial.

Compared to the sourceforge versions (linked from openarchives.org):

- Uses XML::LibXML (DOM 2 API)
- SAX handler & generator
- Support for plugable metadata classes, included are Dublin Core, 
OAI_Eprint and OAI Identifier schemes (so you can access oai_dc using 
Perl hashes)
- Support for OAI static repositories
- Supports OAI versions 1.0 through static 2.0
- Moved to HTTP::OAI::* (won't clobber existing installations)

An example implementation is included for creating a CGI gateway to a 
static repository file.

To install:
perl -MCPAN -e "install HTTP::OAI"

This installs the oai_browser.pl script that allows command-line 
browsing of OAI repositories.

These modules represent very similar functionality to Ed Summer's 
Net::OAI::Harvester for harvesting, but with support for constructing 
OAI responses (the repository side). I hope (!) they are also more 
resilient to repository weirdness.

I use these libraries with Citebase/Celestial, but are still in 
development (hence not going into the main CPAN tree yet).

Comments, suggestions welcome!

Heh, could you be more specific about the "repository weirdness". Nice
work by the way.

UTF-8 errors are probably the most common, but I've "developed out" my 
capability to handle those. Ideally I'd like a PerlIO layer that handles 
bad UTF-8, otherwise I'm sure Perl5.8's UTF support should be usable to 
fix bad chars (or spot latin and recode).

A couple of sites have bad baseURLs in their Identify response, which I 
now check for and ignore - in principle a harvester should follow 
baseURL like a redirect, but some sites have relative URLs!

One site indexed in Celestial (an OAI1.1) expects the verb as the first 
argument in the query, so I've added a special case for that.

Another site has a bad implementation of timestamps - it only accepts 
date+time. So something else to add would be to retry a request with 
appended to from/until T00:00:00Z (probably application layer rather 
than API).

I've added support for oai_dc: or dc: prefixed tags in Dublin Core, 
although I guess I could just check for the namespace.

Other than that; graceful handling of retry-after, redirect, resumption 
token repetition (to one depth only), and retry-on empty response.

All the best,
Tim.

Nice, thanks for the details. It looks like your harvester handles
static repositories as well as OAI v1.1 which is a nice bonus. You might
want to add a listAllRecords(), listAllIdentifiers() which takes some of
the pain out of handling resumption tokens for people who don't want to
understand them.

Another difference worth noting is that HTTP::OAI::Harvester will 
store responses in memory, whereas Net::OAI::Harvester uses object
serialization and disk. Having objects on disk was a safeguard in case a
repository decided to return too many records, which in hindsight
probably never will happen since the server doesn't want to do it either
:-) The trend nowadays is towards speedier apps that use memory
more aggressively, so I think your approach makes more sense.

In general your code is a whole lot cleaner than mine, and should be
faster. Heck it even has a much higher version number :-) I know where to 
point people when they have questions about Net::OAI::Harvester now.

Best,
//Ed

hi

i am releasing v2.2 of XMLFile ... after a very long break ... (my 
apologies to those who have been waiting for the update)

this is an OAI-PMH data provider module that operates over a set of XML 
files that contain the metadata. it is meant to require a minimal of 
effort while retaining all the flexibility of the OAI protocol.

there are some new features - most importantly a lot of the core 
functionality has been rewritten to be more scalable - and i tested all 
the samples against the latest RE and OAI Validator tests.

you can find it and more information at:

   http://aim.cs.uct.ac.za/tiki-index.php?page=XMLFile

let me know if you have any problems with it.

ttfn,
----hussein
