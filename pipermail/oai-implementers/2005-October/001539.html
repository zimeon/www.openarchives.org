<PRE>2 Research positions in audio mining project CHoral

Applications are invited for:
- a postdoc position, and
- a PhD position

The successful applicants will join the project &#8216;CHoral: access to oral  
history&#8217;, running in the research programme CATCH  (Continuous Access  
to Cultural Heritage) which is funded by the Netherlands Organization  
for Scientific Research (NWO).  CHoral is a joint initiative of the  
Municipal Archives Rotterdam and the Human Media Interaction group of  
the  Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer  
Science at the University of Twente.  The CHoral project team will  
carry out a research agenda that aims to advance in the  
state-of-the-art in Spoken Document Retrieval. The focus of attention  
will be on spoken word collections with stories and testimonies on  
historical events, and more in particular on the audio archives of the  
regional radio station Radio Rijnmond. In this audio mining project a  
variety of techniques will be studied and integrated, among which  
automatic speech recognition and information retrieval.  A  project  
description can be downloaded here.

The project will start on 1 January 2006, or as soon as possible  
thereafter.  The University of Twente will act as employer. In  
accordance with standard CATCH regulations, the project team will be  
housed within the premises of the project's heritage partner, the  
Municipal Archives of Rotterdam. (The set-up of the communication and  
collaboration with the experts and supervisors from the University of  
Twente will take the travel distance into account.)

fulfil a coordinating role in the project, to act as trait d'union  
between the project PhD, the project supervisors, the project's  
software engineer(s) and the target user groups.

REQUIREMENTS PHD-POSITION

language technology,  demonstrated by a degree in e.g., phonetics,
