Call for proposals - Code4lib 2006

We are now accepting proposals for prepared talks for Code4lib 2006. [1]
Code4lib 2006 is a loosely structured conference for library technologists
to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be inspired, and forge
collaborations. It is also an outgrowth of the Access HackFest, wrapped into
a conference-ish format. It is *the* event for technologists building
digital libraries and digital information systems, tools, and software.

At least six time slots will be available for prepared talks. We will choose
from among the proposals based on diversity of topics, usefulness, wow
factor, and potential impact.

Proposals of 75 words or less are being accepted for review now. Please send
your name, email address, and proposal to code4libcon. [2]

We cannot accept every prepared talk proposal, but multiple lightning talk
sessions will provide everyone who wishes to present with ample opportunity
to show off. The proposal deadline is January 2, 2006, and proposers will be
notified by January 9, 2006.

Prepared Talk Information

Prepared talks are 20 minutes, and must center on "tools" (some cool new
software, software library or integration platform), "specs" (how to get the
most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones), or "challenges" (One
or more big problems we should collectively address). We will evaluate
proposals on criteria of usefulness, newness, geekiness, and diversity of
topics.

[2] https://lists.gatech.edu/sympa/info/code4libcon


Again, proposals should be sent to [2].

Subject: [OAI-implementers] name value pair question
Message-ID: <20051208112208.FEWL1233.aamta09-winn.ispmail.ntl.com@Swede>

Hi all

I have just subscribed to the list as I was hoping to seek the opinion of
the implementation community on an interoperability issue we are currently
having.

We are experiencing some problems based around how we submit name value
pairs in a query and the specification of a name without a value. 

Take the following query

?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&from=&to=18-10-2005

We are taking the view that this is a valid query i.e. the specification of
&from= with no value is syntactically correct. 

Are we correct in this assumption?

Apologies if this is a trivial question.

Best Regards

Rob Tice

I think parameters without a value should be omitted, hence naming them
"optional arguments". This is certainly the rule followed in the examples
in the specification
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#ProtocolMessages

"from=" would likely be interpreted as a from date that is a null string
and thus give a badArgument error, e.g:
http://eprints.rclis.org/perl/oai2?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&from=&to=2005-10-18

Thanks for the helpful responses and clarification. 

I just wanted to check a last point. We are using the university of Illinois
java OAI toolkit. To anyone else using this toolkit, is this known issue?


Thanks

Dear All,

 

I am new for this forum and really very much impressed with OAI, its vision and aims to the betterment of the society which is lead by Information.

 

Can anybody tell me about the institutions from South Asia which are maintaining Open Archives at their end. 

 

I will be very thankful to you all

 

With best wishes and regards

Hi Suresh,

I maintain a registry of OAI data providers at

   http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/

There is also a list of Top Level Internet Domains from which you can 
determine country of origin:

   http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListTLDs.asp

There is also the Institutional Archives Registry (most of which are 
OAI-PMH compliant) which allows their lists to be sorted by country of 
origin:

   http://archives.eprints.org/eprints.php

I'll let you analyze the lists since my geography isn't so good :-)
