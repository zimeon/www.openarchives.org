<PRE>Thank you for the quick reply Jos&#233;!

&gt;<i> Please be aware that the &quot;O&quot; in &quot;OAI&quot; really intends to mean &quot;Open&quot;! In that
</I>&gt;<i> sense you are raising a relevant requirement for your project, but in fact it
</I>&gt;<i> intentionally never was a requirement for the OAI community...
</I>
Well, I was afraid of that... :-)


&gt;<i> Anyway, there are many &quot;strategies&quot; you can apply to still keep using the
</I>&gt;<i> basic OAI-PMH principles and on the same time apply your requirement... You
</I>&gt;<i> can start by using a VPN, but maybe other very simple one, that just came now
</I>&gt;<i> to my mind, would be to have from the server side an implementation of the
</I>&gt;<i> delivery of the data sets dependent from the IP address of the client (I mean,
</I>&gt;<i> you just need to customize a server for that, so for unknown IPs the server
</I>&gt;<i> gives the &quot;public&quot; data, and the &quot;private&quot; data only to known and previously
</I>&gt;<i> registered IPs...). Just an idea...
</I>
That's definitely an option to consider, I'm going to look into it
more thoroughly. I'm concerned about what happens when institutional
networks are involved. For example, if behind a given IP address
there's an whole network of computers, by authorizing that IP address
we may be granting access to more harvesters (or individuals) than
intended.

I've just thought of a possible alternative, and would love to know
your thoughts about it:
Harvesting an OAI-PMH provider is made entirely through HTTP calls, so
maybe one could use HTTP's basic-authentication? Even if the OAI-PMH
protocol doesn't say that servers should challenge harvesters for
authentication, if a harvester does provide authentication information
(more specifically, if it provides HTTP basic-auth credentials, sent
on the HTTP headers), the harvester could act accordingly. This way,
the OAI-PMH provider would remain compatible with &quot;normal&quot; harvesters,
to which it would provide only the &quot;public&quot; records. But it would be
able to provide additional records to harvesters providing
credentials.

Do you see any reason why this could not work? Please warn me if you
think it's a bad practice for some reason :-)
