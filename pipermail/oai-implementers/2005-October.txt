hi all,

I would like to draw your attention to the following paper which discusses an 
OAI-PMH interface and an OpenURL interface to Open Archival Information Systems:

Bekaert, Jeroen, and Herbert Van de Sompel. Access Interfaces for Open Archival 
Information Systems based on the OAI-PMH and the OpenURL Framework for 
Context-Sensitive Services. 2005. Preprint at 
http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DL/0509090. Draft of an accepted submission for PV 2005 
"Ensuring Long-term Preservation and Adding Value to Scientific and Technical 
data". see http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/pv-2005/ for conference information.

cheers

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI4 registration closure
Message-ID: <20051011141315.GA512@openlib.org>


  Registration for the next CERN workshop on Innovations in Scholarly
  Communication (OAI4) closes on Friday 14 October at midnight local
  time. It is not possible to admit late registrations beyond that
  moment because of security restrictions at the site. So if you have
  not registered and want to participate, I suggest you do so immediately.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] looking for some one to test harvest USC's DP
	implementation
Message-ID: <434C52B5.50805@usc.edu>

The USC DP is ready to be harvested (I hope!).  I am looking for someone 
to harvest the DP as a test run sometime in the next few days, before we 
release it to the general public.  ;-)

Please email me off line if you're willing to run a test harvest.

There are ~105,000 records currently.

Regards,

Jewel

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Research positions in audio mining project CHoral
Message-ID: <5d739c497a2ad0dcdb86ce2caf37d9f4@ewi.utwente.nl>

2 Research positions in audio mining project CHoral

Applications are invited for:
- a postdoc position, and
- a PhD position

The successful applicants will join the project ?CHoral: access to oral  
history?, running in the research programme CATCH  (Continuous Access  
to Cultural Heritage) which is funded by the Netherlands Organization  
for Scientific Research (NWO).  CHoral is a joint initiative of the  
Municipal Archives Rotterdam and the Human Media Interaction group of  
the  Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer  
Science at the University of Twente.  The CHoral project team will  
carry out a research agenda that aims to advance in the  
state-of-the-art in Spoken Document Retrieval. The focus of attention  
will be on spoken word collections with stories and testimonies on  
historical events, and more in particular on the audio archives of the  
regional radio station Radio Rijnmond. In this audio mining project a  
variety of techniques will be studied and integrated, among which  
automatic speech recognition and information retrieval.  A  project  
description can be downloaded here.

The project will start on 1 January 2006, or as soon as possible  
thereafter.  The University of Twente will act as employer. In  
accordance with standard CATCH regulations, the project team will be  
housed within the premises of the project's heritage partner, the  
Municipal Archives of Rotterdam. (The set-up of the communication and  
collaboration with the experts and supervisors from the University of  
Twente will take the travel distance into account.)

REQUIREMENTS POSTDOC POSITION

Postdoc candidates should have a background in at least two of the  
following areas:  speech recognition, information retrieval,  
audio-visual archiving, information management for cultural heritage  
collections. Proficiency in Dutch is a plus.  The expertise gained and  
previous experience should demonstrate the candidate's ability to  
fulfil a coordinating role in the project, to act as trait d'union  
between the project PhD, the project supervisors, the project's  
software engineer(s) and the target user groups.

REQUIREMENTS PHD-POSITION

PhD candidates should have affinity and experience with speech and  
language technology,  demonstrated by a degree in e.g., phonetics,  
computational linguistics, computer science. Basic knowledge of Dutch  
is a must, good programming skills will be needed to collaborate  
effectively with the software engineers.

CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT

-  the post-doc salary depends on experience and qualifications;  
minimum is EUR 2191 gross per month.  Duration of the contract: 3-4  
years. Hours per week: 32-40

be able to participate in the Dutch research school for Information and  
Knowledge Systems (SIKS, http://www.siks.nl/).
