Subject: [OAI-implementers] oai :: how to handle errors during ListRecords
	request?
Message-ID: <4520D0B1.2050704@mpi.nl>


Hi everybody,

maybe this question has already arisen somewhere, but i couldn't make it 
out in the documentation, so I need to ask the community:

How do I handle errors which may occur during a ListRecords request?
For example when during reading a destined result-record's dataset (a 
xml file) some unpredicted error occurs, e.g. an IOException for some 
reason whatsoever.

So what am I supposed to provide in my response then:

- throw away the whole result list and provide an oai-error code
   (and which one in that case)?

- just replace that one concerned record-dataset with an oai error-tag
   (also here: which code then?)

- ignore those errors and remove any failed record-dataset
   from the returned result list?

- ignore those errors and provide an empty record-tag for those datasets


is there a best-practice or any specified procedure?
suggestions are very welcome.

thanx so long
matthias

Hi Matthias,

There is no way to cope with an error in part of a ListRecords response. 
This is essentially outside the OAI model, in which an error-free 
repository is assumed. I think the server should return an HTTP 500 
"Internal Server Error", or perhaps a 503 "Retry After" if there is some 
reasonable hope that the exception would not recur if the request were 
attempted again. A harvester should abort the harvest if it gets an HTTP 
500 error.

The other option would be to consider that such an error condition 
invalidates the resumptionToken and the give a badResumptionToken error
(http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-harvester.htm#resumptionTokenErrorRecovery).

Cheers,
Simeon

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Any good service provider software
	recommendation?

Dear ALL,

 

 

I am looking for good software for implementation of service provider service.  We harvest data from ~30 sites and the total no. of records is ~200K (English, CJK records). 

 

FYI: 

We are currently using Dspace for hosting the data, however, the search/browse/data upload speed is too slow. Moreover, it does not handle synchronization (amend/create/delete) of OAI metadata effectively. (we need to handle it by 3rd programs).

 

Best Regards,

KM Ku

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Open Archives Initiative Announces Object Reuse
	and Exchange (ORE)
Message-ID: <452FACF2.3070103@lanl.gov>

[Apologies for cross-posting]

Open Archives Initiative Announces Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE)

Ithaca, NY and Los Alamos, NM - The Open Archives Initiative (OAI), with
the generous support of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, announces a new
effort as part of its mission to develop and promote interoperability
standards that aim to facilitate the efficient dissemination of content.
Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) will develop specifications that allow
distributed repositories to exchange information about their constituent
digital objects. These specifications will include approaches for
representing digital objects and repository services that facilitate
access and ingest of these representations. The specifications will
enable a new generation of cross-repository services that leverage the
intrinsic value of digital objects beyond the borders of hosting
repositories.

The goals of ORE are inspired by advances in scholarly communication and
the growth of scholarly material that is available in scholarly
repositories including institutional repositories, discipline-oriented
repositories, dataset warehouses, and online journal repositories. This
growth is significant by itself. However, its real importance lies in
the potential for these distributed repositories and their contained
objects to act as the foundation of a new digitally-based scholarly
communication framework. Such a framework would permit fluid reuse,
refactoring, and aggregation of scholarly digital objects and their
constituent parts - including text, images, data, and software. This
framework would include new forms of citation, allow the creation of
virtual collections of objects regardless of their location, and
facilitate new workflows that add value to scholarly objects by
distributed registration, certification, peer review, and preservation
services. Although scholarly communication is the motivating
application, we imagine that the specifications developed by ORE may
extend to other domains.

ORE is funded by Mellon for two years beginning October 2006. It is
coordinated by Carl Lagoze of Cornell University Information Science and
Herbert Van de Sompel of the Los Alamos Research Library.  The ORE
two-year work plan includes:

* Formation of an international advisory committee, consisting of
leaders in e-Science, institutional repositories, publishing, library,
and educational technology communities.
* Formation of an international working group that will meet over the
two year period and develop the set of ORE specifications.
* Establishment and management of an experimental deployment community
that will exercise the developed standards in a variety of contexts.
* Establishment of a sustainable community to support the widespread
deployment and management of the standards fabric.

OAI-ORE will co-exist within the Open Archives Initiative with the
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), the widely deployed standard
for exchange of metadata.  We expect that the naturally more expressive
digital object focus of OAI-ORE will complement the  narrower metadata
focus of OAI-PMH.  OAI-ORE will benefit from the interoperability
experience and depth of the international OAI community.

For more information contact ore@openarchives.org. The ORE web site is
at http://www.openarchives.org/ore/.

Message-ID: <20061017151803.29920.qmail@web25224.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

   Hello
   
  I installed the framwork OAI on an Oracle database :
   
  RECORDS
  ----------------
  SYSID NUMBER
  RECORD_IDENTIFIER NOT NULL VARCHAR2(50)
  TIMESTAMP DATE
  XMLCONTENT XMLTYPE
   
  RECORDSSETS
  -------------------------
  RECORD_IDENTIFIER NOT NULL VARCHAR2(50)
  SET_SPECIFIER                                    VARCHAR2(50)
   
   
  How must I proceed to obtain the attribut status with the value 'deleted' in the header ?
    on the database, which column i must add
  on the framework is there changes to be made ?
   
   
  Best regards
