Over 47,000 records on science and technology ready for
harvesting.

VTT Publications Register (JURE) has recently added support
for the OAI MPH 2.0. JURE contains metadata about publications
written by research staff of VTT, including also material published
by some other party than VTT. Many of the monographs and articles
are also available as fulltext (set publication:fulltext). However, access
to the fulltext  material published by other parties than VTT may be
restricted. (There are e.g. links to fulltext-articles published by
commercial publishers and vendors.)

More information on VTT http://www.vtt.fi/indexe.htm

The base URL is http://cgi.vtt.fi/progs/inf/OAI

Only oai_dc metadata format is currently supported. Sets are implemented.

In case of problems or questions contact me.

Message-ID: <3DB871E13177D61198850000E222F2EBDFF9B5@ebano2.ibict.br>

Dear implementers,

I'm searching the previous messages too, but I haven´t found an answer yet.
Asking it now may be faster..

I need to know if the protocol validates XML Schemas. I mean does the
Service Provider program do that or the Harvester do it, and if either does
it, how it´s accomplished. Apparently it doesn´t. There is no log of
accessing the XSD file, and the code only outputs a valid header for the
record...

The only place I have seen a schema validation is testing the repository in
the OAI Explorer.

We are using the Protocol and the Harvesting program from Hussein Suleman,
for OAI 2.0.

hi Ramon

i guess the short answer is that validation is not required either by a 
harvester or service provider (if these are separated). however, in 
quality-critical applications it is a good idea to do it.

that said, i think some of us assume the responses are more-or-less 
valid if we know that the archive has passed the RE and OAI Registry 
tests - so we don't test while harvesting. philosophically, in the 
extreme case, if a static archive was tested properly once, why should 
every service provider have to test it again?

but if you really want to ... to test for post-registration changes that 
make the archive non-compliant, you would have to do schema validation 
on every response/record obtained. to test for validity of every single 
record (rather than a sample like the RE checks) you could write a 
simple harvester that obtains and validates all the records of an 
archive (i have heard of such programs but havent seen one listed on the 
OAI website yet).

I've attached a one page (or at least it was one page until I put our legal
text into it!) Python script that will pull records from a repository and
dump them to a file.  In spite of its length it:

  o Handles resumption tokens
  o Notices OAI errors
  o Supports compression
  o Respects 503 Retry-After's

It doesn't know much about XML, though, so the file created is just a
collection of the downloaded XML responses, and the only metadata format it
asks for is oai_dc, even though it does ask the repository for the metadata
formats supported.  Sets are ignored, but would be fairly easy to add.

I tested it using Python 2.2.2 under Windows 2000 against several
repositories.

It is invoked by:
  python harverst.py [repository-address outputfile]
e.g.:
  python harvest.py alcme.oclc.org/ndltd/servlet/OAIHandler ndltd.out

If you just run the script without parameters it defaults the NDLTD
repository (around 39,000 digital thesis and dissertation records).

Anyway, I thought it was interesting to see how much could be done in less
than 60 lines.

There should be a badArgument error because you have both a
resumptionToken and metadataPrefix/until arguments. resumptionToken is an
exclusive argument so the metadataPrefix/until arguments are not allowed
in the same request. (see
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#ProtocolMessages
for explanation of exclusive argument)

Note also that when there is a badArgument error, you must not include the
attributes in the <request> element.

hi

i did some tests a long time ago and the basics seem to be fairly 
straight-forward.

the fine-print could be another matter however ... so i have a group of 
students doing an in-depth study of SOAP applied to the OAI-PMH, 
including a draft spec rewrite, baseline tools and implementations, 
testing tools, an end-to-end SOAP-OAI-based system, performance 
evaluations and comparisons, etc.

their final report will be completed by the beginning of october and 
will be submitted to the OAI as a feasability study - this will 
hopefully serve as the basis for a new working group to develop a formal 
SOAP-OAI spec.

also, we need to be a little cautious - W3C recently upped the new SOAP 
spec to "proposed recommendation". it would be wise to wait until it is 
a "recommendation" before OAI finalises a SOAP spec.

ttfn,
----hussein

Steve,

You cannot use the exact same baseURL for four different
collections, because the baseURL is a database key.  Could
you vary the baseURL in such as way that the same code
would run but the string is different?

I am thinking of something like
http:/server/dir1/dirx/servlet-script where dirx says collection
x but really on your machine they are all the same directory?

If so, this would achieve the result you want, of 4 collections
being registered and displayed.

Since creating a one-page Python OAI-PMH harvester (see an improved, even
shorter, version at  http://purl.oclc.org/net/hickey/oai/harvest.py
<http://purl.oclc.org/net/hickey/oai/harvest.py> ) , I've been seeing how
our OAI repositories perform on full harvests.
 
OCLC Research runs two main repositories of metadata about theses and
dissertations:
 
XTCat ( http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/ <http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/> ) with
some 4.3 million bibliographic records 
NDLTD ( http://alcme.oclc.org/ndltd/ <http://alcme.oclc.org/ndltd/> ) which
has around 38,000 records.
 
My workstation can harvest XTCat in around 90 minutes if compression is used
(over a 10 megabit line).  Without compression it takes at least half again
as long, and my machine is much busier.  I was slightly surprised at the
difference in bytes-received that compression makes:  8:1 for the larger
database and 7:1 for the smaller.
 
Harvesting at home via a cable modem takes slightly less than 4 hours to
harvest the 4.3 million records.  That is about 300 records/second.  Each
record is about 1,000 bytes (uncompressed).
 
The 90 minute harvest is 800 records/second (800,000 bytes/second).  The
best time observed for doing two harvests simultaneously was 120 minutes, or
1,200 records/second.  The most records/second observed was slightly more
than 1,400 records/second when running four simultaneous harvests, probably
close to the maximum rate the repository can support.
 
Running multiple harvests simultaneously did find a weakness in the
repository code, which would occasionally run out of memory.  We seem to
have that fixed now, but I expect that error recovery is important for
reliably accomplishing large harvests.

Subject: [Oai-pear-devel] PEAR::OAI 0.4.0 Released
Date: Monday 30 June 2003 14:18

The PEAR::OAI developers team is happy to announce the immediate availability
of PEAR::OAI 0.4.0.

Please notice these important changes:
- PEAR::OAI server reduced to only care about protocol layer, content
 response is created by backend
- more documentation, now edited online in a Wiki at
http://www.zzoss.com/phpwiki/index.php/PearOai

### Description ###

PEAR::OAI is a PHP class library for the Open Archives Initiative Protocol
 for Metadata Harvesting (http://www.openarchives.org). This library provides
 a Server (= Repository) and in the future also a Client (= Harvester)
interface. This package is conformant to and makes use of PEAR
(http://pear.php.net) classes.

### Featurs ###

- full OAI-PMH version 2.0 compliance (tested with OAI Repository Explorer)
- easy and flexible configuration (well documented)
- modular data backend system allows plug-in of several data storage
interfaces that wrap different data structures
- integrated template output system to provide arbitrary metadata format
output, provided as a plugin module
- compressed XML support, which greatly reduces used bandwidth
- garbage collection of resumption tokens (via PHP session functions)
- resumption token sessions can be stored in filesystem or database
- checking expiration date of resumption tokens
- debug mode to track errors in logfile
- object oriented PHP
- PEARDoc (~JavaDoc) inline documentation

### Changelog ###

New Featurs:

- PEAR::OAI server reduced to only care about protocol layer, content
 response is created by backend
- modular plugin architecture for various types of backends provided by
different vendors
- modular plugin architecture for markup output
- getRecord takes metadata prefix as argument
- moved methods for identifier masquerading to backend abstract class
(Server/Backend.php)
- check if backend supports a certain method
- split descriptions (e.g. friends) from Identify.tpl to separate templates
- new helper class for template parsing (Server/Output.php)
- using static oai prefix when dealing with masquerading (better performance)

Bugs fixed:

- renamed Server/tpl/ListIdentifiers_oai_dc.tpl to
Server/tpl/ListIdentifiers.tpl because there is no output specific to a
metadata format
- stripped off php version check in OAI_Base::xmlEncode() because we only
 work with PHP >= 4.2.0
- all XML output UTF-8 encoded

Miscellaneous

- replaced OAI_Base::recordStorage() with OAI_Server::backend()
- OAI_Server::backend takes instantiated backend object as argument
- deleted template_path option for OAI, instead, we have packages for output,
located in the OAI/Output/ directory
- more documentation, now edited online in a Wiki at
http://www.zzoss.com/phpwiki/index.php/PearOai

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0306301118350.23742-100000@lark.lanl.gov>

Hi,

We are pleased to announce the release of our software implementation of an OAI
Static Repository Gateway.  Our Static Repository Gateway software is compliant
with the alpha specification for the OAI Static Repository and Static Repository
Gateway available at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm .

* Our software is available at SourceForge
https://sourceforge.net/projects/srepod/
* A brief description is available at http://srepod.sourceforge.net/

We would like to emphasize that the OAI Implementation Guideline for the Static
Repository and for the Static Repository Gateway are in alpha phase, and hence
are subject to change.  As a result, there are no guarantees that our current
implementation will be compatible with the final OAI specification for the
Static Repository and for the Static Repository Gateway, when released.

Greetings
