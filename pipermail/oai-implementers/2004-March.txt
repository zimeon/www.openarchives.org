Hi All.:

I'm upgrading the machine hosting Virginia Tech OAI Explorer.
Things may be a little bit messy in the next few days.

Will get back to you after the upgrading finish.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <200403040108.i2418iC16494@nsdlib.nsdl.cornell.edu>

Why the value of cursor of resumptionToken is alway "0" in the first incomplete list response? It seems odd. In terms of its definition(a count of the number of elements of the complete list thus far returned ), it should be the number of records
returned in the first incomplete list response, because when the first resumptionToken returned,a certain number(i.e. 1000) of records was already returned. Right?

 				
Very Respectfully,

Greeting OAI-implementers,
=20
I was wondering if someone could tell me the most accurate way to ensure
my OAI harvesting program has harvested all of the records of a
repository.  Is there any way to get some sort of collection or
repository metadata that holds a "total number of records" value?  Or,
because oai_dc metadata records are the most common denominator (and
required for minimal OAI compliance?), can I assume that a request like
this:
http://services.nsdl.org:8080/nsdloai/OAI?verb=3DListRecords&metadataPref=
i
x=3Doai_dc
=20
will give me the most complete set of records possible (once no more
resumptionTokens are available)?
=20
TIA for any help.  Hope this wasn't in a FAQ somewhere that I missed.

I'm afraid there has been a problem with the OAI-implementers mail
server which resulted in a number of messages being delayed. The
queued message should now have been sent out.

Since OAI-PMH works over HTTP, port 80 is the norm. The baseURL can
include a port so anything else can be used. I don't see a need for
agreement on any particular port.

See the example in:
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#FlowControl

The cursor is the number of records or headers returned up to the start of
the incomplete list response. Thus the first response always has cursor=0
if it is specified.

The Library of Congress is providing set descriptions, see
  http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/oai2_0?verb=ListSets

The descriptions use the oai_dc schema.  They are essentially
collection-level records for the underlying collection of content EXCEPT
that I use "Records for " at the beginning of the title.  When I wanted to
do this, I could not find another pattern; you should not look at the
practice you infer from them as authoritative in any way.

I would be interested in knowing who (if anyone) is finding them useful.

Any further description of sets is useful for service providers. The 
set name, being short, can't always completely describe the contents of 
the set. More description helps us decide whether we want to harvest a 
particular set.

following up on Kat's comment, and seeing that my personal website is on 
Xiaoming's listing ...

try
http://www.husseinsspace.com/cgi-bin/VTOAI/hspics/hspics/oai.pl?verb=ListSets

i have a description for each set in my source metadata so i encode that 
in a simple DC record with only a description tag. the idea being that 
set descriptions are meant to help people understand the contents of 
sets (for the purposes of selective harvesting) so any 
human-understandable information you can provide is useful while at the 
same time there is probably no point in automatically generating 
non-textual/descriptive fields such as date.

of course this is all arguable so feel free to vociferously disagree 
with me about the date or the human-understanding bits :)

Thank you all for your help!!
   Xiaoming, we are checking out all those you listed-- and
Caroline, we especially love what you are doing.  We want to be
able to harvest sets based on subject content, and then make
those available to (first) our subject librarians.  Eventually,
we hope to set up a portal for use by students and researchers
that will provide access to different collections (sets) based on
general topical areas.
   I think I will bring this up at the next DLF developer's forum
(as well as my hopes for authority control on subjects) where the
topic is to be "improving the harvestability of digital content
and metadata".

  Thanks again!

This has been mentioned before, but it might be useful to take a look at 
what the DC Collection Description Working Group is doing around collection 
description. I think that this work could have great applicability for set 
descriptions. See http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/.

Hello,

Could someone tell me the status of the OAI Static Repository? I get a 
couple requests each week from people who don't have the resources to 
become full-fledged data providers. I would like to point them to a 
place where they can drop their XML files, but I gather this doesn't 
officially exist yet.

We are finalizing the Static Repository specification at this very moment. 
Feedback from the NSDL community suggested the inclusion of a mechanism to 
"unregister" a Static Repository from a Static Repository Gateway.  We are 
looking into accomodating that need.

When it comes to a "place to drop" XML files (we refer to that spot as a Static 
Repository Gateway):

(1) There is LANL-created software available to create such spots (see 
http://srepod.sourceforge.net/ )

(2) LANL operates a demo version of such a spot (see 
http://libtest.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/gateway.cgi ).  However, this is for demo 
purposes only; we have no intention of running a production version.

I invite you to install and operate our Static Repository Gateway software at 
OAIster.

many greetings

herbert

Hi Kat,

We also have an alpha/beta level implementation of an OAI Static Repository 
Gateway which is available on SourceForge:

http://uilib-oai.sourceforge.net/
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47963&package_id=85826

It is implemented as an IIS Active Server Page (ASP) script.

Currently it is being used to gateway one repository:

http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/gateway/oai.asp/www.acnatsci.org/library/collections/imls/nlg/AcadNatSciStatic.xml?verb=Identify,

However, we would be willing to act as a gateway for other collections.  We 
are not currently responding to the 'initiate' request (Section 3.3 of the 
spec.), so if you have a collection you would like to be added, you should 
send me an email with the URL to the static XML file, and I will make sure 
it validates and add it to the gateway if it does.

This is still an experimental implementation, so the usual caveats apply, 
but we do intend on keeping it running for the foreseeable future, probably 
with some downtime to introduce changes or fixes as the spec evolves.

Message-ID: <1078959517.21846.52.camel@edtech25.edtech.athabascau.ca>

Hi.

I have a preliminary implementation of OAI-PMH around our native IEEE
LTSC LOM repository:
http://adlibx.athabascau.ca/ADLib/OAI/?verb=Identify

I provide both the required Dublin Core XML, as well as IEEE LOM XML:
http://adlibx.athabascau.ca/ADLib/OAI/?verb=ListMetadataFormats

You can retrieve Erik Duval's sample LOM record at:
DC: http://adlibx.athabascau.ca/ADLib/OAI/?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=urn:x-ims-plirid-v0:urn%3Ax-ims-plirid-v0%3Aadlib.athabascau.ca%3Asys%3Aadlibx%3A1
LOM: http://adlibx.athabascau.ca/ADLib/OAI/?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=lom&identifier=urn:x-ims-plirid-v0:urn%3Ax-ims-plirid-v0%3Aadlib.athabascau.ca%3Asys%3Aadlibx%3A1

All responses validate against the appropriate schema's, and the
repository passes all the tests on Virginia Tech's OAI Repository
Explorer.

I didn't know of any other OAI+LOM implementations to compare against,
so I hope my implementation is sane (?).

--
FYI:

The human oriented interface to our repository is at:
Athabasca Digital Library: http://adlib.athabascau.ca/

The implementation is written in Java, and provided as Free Software
under the LGPL.  This work is part of a larger project which includes
Java interfaces for a representing a LOM record, and JAXB Marshallers
for serializing to LOM, DC, and OAI XML.  There is also a Java interface
for a whole Repository, and service implementations (GUI, SOAP, OAI,
HTTP, RSS, etc) built around that.  It's a work in progress and
documentation is currently minimal.  You can find details at:
http://adlib.athabascau.ca/~hubick/

hi

for not exactly LOM, but the IMS metadata set (LOM + minor 
modifications) ... check the CSTC archive with baseURL
   http://www.cstc.org/cgi-bin/OAI/CSTC.pl

its the older v1.1 PMH, but the XML encoding of records and IMS standard 
have not changed since then (i think). this mapping was set up and 
tested with the iLumina project, that uses the IMS metadata set internally.

for an example record, try: 
http://www.cstc.org/cgi-bin/OAI/CSTC.pl?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=ims1_2_1&identifier=oai:CSTC:60

in general, to find other implementations for a metadata standard, you 
can also use the UIUC registry (which is apparently not linked into the 
OAI website yet). if you go to:
   http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListSchemas.asp
you will be able to find all archives that support a particular metadata 
format.

ttfn,
----hussein

Thank you for the information, Herbert and Tom. The idea of  
implementing a Static Repository Gateway at UM is a great idea. We'll  
bring it up in discussions here soon.

There's a fair amount of work going on the UK related to this, it goes 
under the catchy title of the RDN/LTSN Interoperability Project, 
http://www.ltsn.ac.uk/genericcentre/interop/ . I don't think anyone has yet 
gone public with a harvester, but I know folk are working on them and I've 
forwarded your message to them.

An article about a loosely related earlier implementation can be found at 
http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue34/powell/intro.html , and there'll be 
another in the next issue of Ariadne.

Hi again :)

This, and an email Kat Hagedorn sent me off list (hi Kat), reminds me of
a big question about identifiers...

As you may know, LOM identifiers are catalog/entry *pairs*.  That is to
say, the entry is namespaced by it's catalog - the repository could
conceivably have two different records with the same identifier entry in
different catalogs.  However, OAI and Dublin Core, and RSS, etc, use a
*single* string as an identifier.

In a repository that harvests from a number of different systems through
a variety of protocols, and has identifiers from many catalog types (not
necessarily URI's)...

How does one map an arbitrary catalog/entry *pair*, to a *single*
identifier string?

My answer was to use a URN:

'urn:' + <catalog> + ':' + <entry>

Note:
1) Identifiers used in OAI messages must be URI's.
2) In the OAI Identifier format ('oai:'), the namespace ID must be a
domain name.  The repository Hussein linked violates this.
3) The LOM/RDF stuff seems to expect all people to use 'URI' as a
catalog in their LOM data (?).

My runner up was a Universal Name:
'{' + <catalog> + '}' + <entry>
That notation was invented by James Clark
http://www.jclark.com/xml/xmlns.htm ), but the URI req killed that idea.
Ideally, the LOM to Dublin Core mapping in Appendix B of the IEEE LTSC
LOM spec would have set up a practice this, but alas, it does not.

Has anyone else tackled this problem?

Thanks.

One problem with this approach is that there is presumably very little
consistency across services in the way that 'catalog' is assigned - i.e.
the 'catalog' is not taken from a controlled vocabulary.  So although you
end up with a single single string identifier (the URN) you don't really
have a mechanism for reliably comparing URNs from different sources.

It seems to me that the 'catalog'/'entry' pairing in LOM is a bit broken
- because it really requires a global registry of 'catalog' names to work
properly.  (At least, without a global registry I can have no way of
knowing if your 'catalog' is the same as my 'catalog').  URIs already
provide a global space within which new identifier schemes can be created
- why not use it, rather than building a LOM-specific registry.

In partricular, the proposed 'info' URI scheme

http://info-uri.info/registry/docs/misc/faq.html

provides an open mechanisn for assigning URIs to information assets that
have identifiers in public namespaces but have no representation within
URI space.

> Has anyone else tackled this problem?

Not really, but you might be interested in

Guidelines for encoding identifiers in Dublin Core and IEEE LOM metadata
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi-ieee/identifiers/

which basically suggests that URIs should *always* be used.

First, can we assume, for the sake of my problem discussion, that all
those who create some new identifier format do in fact manage to choose
a truly unique catalog name, just as if there were in fact a registry
(that's a tangental discussion :).

Oooh, that's new, thanks for that :)

Ok, so, if I use that, then the algorithm would be:

IF (LOM.Identifier.Catalog == 'URI')
 THEN export LOM.Identifier.Entry unmodified
ELSE
 export info URI as:
 'info:' + <catalog> + '/' + <entry>

I will read more about these info URI's to see if that's a valid use
(?).

Hrm, that's interesting too, thanks.  Though it's basically the reverse
problem.

One thing that does bring to light is using 'URI' as your LOM Catalog
whenever your entries are in URI format.  I have been using our URN's
Namespace Identifier (NID) as our Catalog, when I perhaps should be
using 'URI' instead (or the more specific 'URN')?

Thanks!

[relates to OAI-implementers digest, Vol 1 #426 - 5 msgs]

A number of IMS specs have played with this 2 part/1part problem. RDCEO 
(Reusable Definition of Competences and Educational Objectives) talks about 
URN scheme, and I think we had assumed that the catalog would map to the 
NSS and the entry to the NID. We also considered URL#fragment identifier , 
where the fragment identifier was the entry part. The RDCEO binding 
actually used a single identifier string, whereas the information model DID 
follow LOM practice.

Exactly what the significance of LOM catalog might be is probably another 
question, and one that is intentionally open I think. Is it necessarily 
more than an _indicator_ of the creator of the identifier?

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Automatically gathering the full-text of eprints
Message-ID: <Pine.WNT.4.56.0403171321500.-1698253@ulpc-ap-home.bath.ac.uk>

The JISC-funded ePrints UK project has a requirement to automatically
harvest both metadata and full-text from the eprint archives within UK
academia (and potentially elsewhere).  This is so that we can pass both
metadata and full-text to the various 'enhancement' Web services offered
by our partners.

http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/

In order for our harvesting robot to be able to do this, it must be able
to reliably (and automatically) determine the correct URL(s) for the
various full-text manifestation(s) (HTML, PDF, RTF, etc.) of each eprint.

Our "Using simple Dublin Core to describe eprints" guidelines are intended
to encourage greater consistency in the metadata that is exposed by eprint
archives using the 'oai_dc' format within the OAI Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting (OAI-PMH).  Somewhat perversely, because we stick rigidly to
the semantics of the DC element set, our guidelines make determining the
URL of each manifestation that is available quite difficult.  (This is
largely a consequence of the 'simple' nature of 'simple DC'!).  In
general, the URL in the <dc:identifier> element of the oai_dc record is
the URL of a jump-off page, rather than a direct link to the full-text.

We would like to suggest a new proposal for unambiguously embedding the
URL for each manifestation of an eprint into the (X)HTML jump-off page for
that eprint.  Since the jump-off page is generated automatically by the
eprint archive software, doing this shouldn't be too difficult (in fact,
we would hope that archive software, such as eprints.org, will be
configured to do this out of the box).

If this proposal is adopted, it will make it much easier to write OAI
service provider software that can reliably gather the full-text of an
eprint, given only the oai_dc record for that eprint.

The proposal is at

http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/docs/encoding-fulltext-links/

Dear Andy,

The problem of service providers needing access to content in addition to 
metadata has come up in many discussions, lately, including in the realm of the 
DARE, DINI, JISC, DSpace, Fedora, etc work.  It so happens that my team in Los 
Alamos has recently done quite some work in this realm, as is illustrated by the 
most recent papers listed on my personal web site.

Here is some initial feedback to the proposal.   The proposal relies on:

a. The assumption that a harvester knows that something that is in the 
dc.identifier element of oai_dc points to a - compliant - jump-off page.  There 
are two problems with this assumption:
- lots of things can be in the dc.identifier element both resolvable and 
unresolvable
- lots of things at the end of the thing identified by the content of 
dc.identifier (if resolvable) will not be compliant jump-off pages

This means harvesters never really know when they are facing the scenario that 
you target, and hence will do a lot of meaningless dererferencing and parsing. 
One could think of addressing this to some extent by a special-purpose 
Descriptor in the Identify response to indicate that a repository actually is 
'compliant' but that would still leave the harvester guessing about which of the 
dc.identifiers (if there are multiple) is the magic one.

b. The actual existence of a 'jump-off' page.  This is something that - in the 
context of the OAI-PMH (with its disconnection of DP and SP) we can not just 
take for granted or assume.

There are other problems related to obtaining content which are not covered by 
the solution:

* How does a harvester know when to go after an update to content?  The OAI-PMH
indicates that the datestamp of a record only changes when the metadata has 
changed, it doesn't say anything about the content.  I suggest it should stay 
that way.  So, in the proposed solution, content in a repo can change without 
the harvester ever knowing about it.

* The scenario as described in the propsoal, in which a single metadata record 
corresponds with a single "preprint" is only a special case of - future - 
reality.  Increasingly, objects held in and described by repositories will be 
"compound" or "complex", i.e. consisting of multiple datastreams, not just a 
single "preprint".  I find that it would be desirable that a solution to get to 
the content would be able to handle such situations.  The proposed solution 
could actually accomodate such 'compound' objects, because the mutliple 
datastreams are linked off the jump-off page.  There is, however, a problem. 
Let's presume we have a situation in which an object is deposited in an 
institutional repository that has 2 datastreams, each of which actually has a 
unique identifier, say a doi or something.  Thinking of a - future - 
self-archiving scenario and the trend to accord identifiers at finer levels of 
granularity, this is not unlikely at all.  Now we get 3 things in dc.identifier 
(2 doi's and a link to a jump-off page), and 2 things in the jump-off page 
(links to the 2 datastreams).  How do I know which doi goes with which 
datastream?  Information that - I hope we will all agree - is rather significant.

OK.  The point I am trying to make is that the described scenario and its more 
general problem domain (beyond eprints, and into the realm of objects with 
multiple datastreams) may call for another approach.  Our research has shown 
that such an approach can remain 100% OAI-PMH-based if a complex object format 
such as METS, MPEG-21 DIDL or SCORM is used.  These formats can be "parallel" 
OAI-PMH "metadata formats" through which harvesters can get to the content 
without running into issues such as the ones mentioned above.  Content can be 
embedded in the XML wrappers or pointed at by them.  Identifiers can be 
unambiguously connected to content.  If content changes, the datstamp of the 
"conplex" record changes.

I anticipate concerns re the overhead of introducing a solution based on a 
complex object format.  At this point, I would like to say 2 things with this 
respect:

* It took 2 people on my team about 2 days to create a prototype plug-in that 
enables OAI-PMH harvesting of content from DSpace repositories.  Our plug-in 
rendered content using the MPEG-21 DIDL XML wrapper format.  Most of the time 
invested in this plug-in was spent figuring out the DSpace API and a sensible 
way to map the DSpace data model to the DIDL data model.  The prototype was 
demonstrated at the DSpace federation meeting, last week.  Although 
questions/issues did arise in the course of our work, non seemed unsolvable. 
But it is my impression that the very fast delivery of a prototype indicates the 
feasibility of the complex format approach.

* I would personally be very willing to spend time with the apporpiate 
representatives of the community - including yourself - to work towards a 
solution that is future-proof and provides adequate guarantees regarding 
perceived requirements of a content-harvesting solution.  I would actually 
prefer that over going for a solution which is attractive at first glance 
because of its obvious simplicity, but which seems to raise some relevant 
questions upon closer inspection.

To end, I would like to thank you for bringing this topic to the list.  I have 
had many private email exchanges over the last few months especially with 
representatives from DARE and DINI about this and related problem domains.  I 
hope that your mail can be another impulse towards a joint action in this realm. 
  The problem is very real, and I would love our community to jointly create a 
really good solution to it.

many greetings

herbert

I trust that the amount of seconds it takes to implement a solution is not the 
only evaluation criterion.  I very much agree it is an important one, and it is 
one that has always played a significant role in designing the OAI-PMH and 
related specifications.  But it seems to me that there are other criteria such 
as meeting functional requirements that play.  I have, obviously, not seen the 
list of requirements.  I do understand the goals, however.  And, as described in 
my previous mail, I can think of some possible requirements related to those 
goals that may not be met by the proposed solution.

This consideration clearly allows for alternative solutions to the problem than 
the one based on complex objects, which I described in my previous mail.  I 
suggested the complex object path because we have done quite some work in that 
realm, and because that work has urged us to think in a general way about the 
content-harvesting problem.

Hrm, that is what I have been doing up until now, but I am coming to
think I was wrong...

I don't think it is open, the LOM spec says the catalog is "A namespace
scheme".  This would, at least to me, clearly indicate that the entry is
namespaced by it's catalog.  Any other interpretation would lead to much
greater problems, in that many people simply use increasing integer
numbers to identify their metadata records, and without those numbers
being namespaced by the catalog, we would have *many* collisions.

We basically have a 'three level' system.  It is up to all those people
sharing any particular LOM catalog to guarantee uniqueness within *that*
catalog.  For those (most) of us who share the 'URI' catalog, we have
the same uniqueness requirement, which we use the NID to satisfy.  This
pushes it down a level, where all those people sharing any particular
NID must also guarantee uniqueness within that NID.  A system like 'oai'
uses DNS names to do this.

IMHO, three levels is overly complex.  Yes, we could all run off and use
whatever format entries we like, namespaced by our catalog (which is
pretty much what people have done up until recently).  In an ideal
world, however, we would remove this extra level by all using the same
catalog, and partition within that ourselves.  The URI system gives us
that catalog, partitioned by NID.  All those using URI's have done the
extra work in agreeing to share a common syntax and associated
facilities for partioning the 'URI' namespace.  By not using a 'URI'
catalog, you basically mitigate that effort by making the fact you are
actually using URI format entries *opaque* to others from a LOM
perspective.

I think LOM might have been better off to do as OAI has done and just
force everyone to uncode their id's as URI's, rather than having a
separate catalog field, but they didn't, so here we are.

You may still be able to talk in URI terms about objects with these ids by using 
the info URI scheme.  See http://info-uri.info/ .

Herbert,
thanks for the email.  Yes, I completely agree with this analysis.  The
proposal is a bit of a hack, and we should perhaps have made this clearer
in the document!

However, I think it is a useful hack :-).  Particularly so in the context
of our other recommendations for using simple DC to describe eprints.
Furthermore, I would see it as good practice to embed XHTML <link>
elements into jump-off pages anyway - irrespective of whether the
intention is to ease harvesting by robots or not.  So I certainly don't
see our proposal as causing any harm.

The rest of your email raises some quite significant issues - some of
which I suspect are not very easy to discuss by email.  I don't propose
giving a detailed response here, but I would like to note a few issues for
consideration...

Firstly, your comments about the complexity of the objects being described
only goes part-way to describing the problem.  The OAI-PMH specification,
rightly, says very little about the nature of the resources that are
described by the records exchanged using the protocol.  However,
particular applications of the protocol do need to be clear about the
nature of the resources being described.  Furthermore, the complexity of
the problem is not just about whether the resources being described are
aggregations of multiple objects.  Part of the complexity arises because
those those resources/objects fit into a model of the real world that
spans both 'conceptual' works and specific digital or physical
'manifestations' of those conceptual works.

Does the oai_dc record that I allow you to harvest describe a conceptual
work (or expression of a work), an article for example, or does it
describe one of the particular manifestations of that work, the PDF copy
of the article for example?

You'll note that I am intentionally using terms from the IFLA FRBR
(Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) model here.

In our guidelines for using simple DC to describe eprints we made the
explicit decision to reflect the fact that most implementations of eprint
archives (that we looked at) appeared to be configured to expose oai_dc
metadata about the 'work' rather than about the particular manifestations
of the work (though actually, in many cases (even in our own guidelines
to a certain extent) there is a certain amount of fuzziness going on!).

Unfortunately, there is no real way of indicating in a simple DC record
that the work (as opposed to the manifestation) is being described - this
would be difficult even in qualified DC currently, because the current
DCMI Type vocabulary doesn't allow us to make those distinctions.  But, in
principle, the DC model is rich enough to handle this complexity - if
we are prepared to put the effort in to agree how to do it.

But the situation is even more complex than that because it is not clear
to me where OAI resources and records sit within the Web architectural
model of 'resources' and 'representations'.  My suspicion is that the FRBR
'manifestation' is the equivalent of the Web architecture
'represresentation' of the FRBR 'work' (if you see what I mean!).  The
oai_dc record (and indeed the jump-off page) is a 'representation' of
the 'work' (assuming that is what is being described).  But at this point
we almost certainly need a diagram or two! :-(

OK, so on then to the question about whether the protocol can and/or
should be used to exchange 'resources' as well as 'metadata' about
'resources'.

The protocol spec is very explicit in differentiating 'resources' from
'items' and 'records' and makes it very clear that the protocol be used to
exchange 'metadata' between services - I'm thinking of section 2.2 in
particular.  Now, with hindsight, I really wish we'd talked instead about
'resources' and 'representations' rather than resources, items, records
and metadata, because that would have given us much more flexibility about
what we do with the protocol.  But we didn't - and therefore, I think we
are constrained in terms of what we can do within the semantics of the
protocol spec.

This is not just to do with the words being used in the spec.  It has to
do with the entities in the model used by the protocol and the identifiers
that are assigned to those entities.  An oai-identifier, for exanmple, is
an identifier of an 'item', not of a 'resource' (in terms of the protocol
usage of those words).  It seems to me that things are likely to become
very fuzzy if the 'item' or 'record' suddenly becomes the 'resource' and
vice versa.

So, based on this, it seems to me that the protocol will 'break' if we
start using it to carry the 'resource' where the protocol expects to see
the 'record about the resource'.

Now, your complex example of the METS package or the MPEG-21 DIDL is an
interesting case - because those things can be used to carry both the
metadata and the object.  Is a METS package the 'resource' or the 'record'
in OAI terms?  The answer is that it is somewhere in-between.  I certainly
accept that the METS package is a 'representation' of a 'resource' - but,
as I mentioned above, unfortunately we didn't use the words 'resource' and
'representation' in the protocol spec.  Yes, the complex package can be
viewed as metadata - but metadata about what - about the 'work' that the
objects in the package 'represent', or about the particular manifestations
contained in the package??!

All in all, I think I'm happy with the case where OAI is used to carry the
METS or DIDL package that contain objects - but I would be much less happy
with a situation where the OAI-PMH is used to carry individual
manifestations (an XHTML document for example).  But the fuzziness between
the package and the item worries me and I'm not sure that we are going to
be able to tell them apart very easily in all cases.

Enough for now...  I agree with you that much more discussion and thinking
about these issues is required.  I'm certainly happy (and indeed
expecting) to be told I'm wrong about any or all of the above! :-)

Andy.

Message-ID: <405B4E47.5090309@lanl.gov>

Dear Andy,

Thanks a lot for your thoughtful comments.  I provide some feedback, here, 
hoping that we can find some time to discuss all of this with representatives 
from the community in front of a much needed blackboard (whiteboard?).

First, let me say that this mail isn't at all about trying to prove you wrong. 
  Quite to the contrary. This is about conveying my perception of matters, 
hoping to further our joint insights in this rather complicated domain.

Second, I feel that your FRBR-related comments, while very legitimate, are on 
quite the opposite end of the scale of your pragmatic, useful hack.  I need to 
take some time to try and think about how much or how little a discussion 
related to making content accessible to service providers in the OAI-PMH 
framework should get involved with this.  At this point I am puzzled.  For 
example, I am not sure how much Google cares about the work/manifestation issue. 
  Google wants a FRBR Item.

Third, I must emphasize that I am very pleased to hear that - in principle - you 
find the notion of shipping modelled representations (DIDL, METS, ...) of 
resources through the OAI-PMH acceptable.  Below, I hope to give some more 
indications as to why I feel that is indeed acceptable/appropriate in the 
context of the OAI-PMH.

=> Your W3C TAG resource/representation perspective is very helpful.  Building 
on your insights, and with some stretching, one could distinguish the following 
levels:

level 1: W3C.resource ~ FRBR.work ~ OAI-PMH.resource

level 2: W3C.representation ~ FRBR.manifestation ~ OAI-PMH.record

=> Comments I want to make at this point:

* The OAI-PMH doesn't really say that an OAI-PMH.resource sits at level 1, and I 
am not even sure it matters a lot for this discussion because the action we are 
interested in is at level 2 at which the OAI-PMH.resource clearly does not sit.

* Putting OAI-PMH.record at the level of W3C.representation makes a lot of 
sense, especially since v.2.0 of the protocol in which OAI-PMH.records have 
gained autonomy by getting their own datestamp.

* I dare to suggest that OAI-PMH.record ~ OAI-PMH.metadata ~ structured data 
pertaining to an OAI-PMH.resource.  I dare to make this statement because the 
OAI-PMH has this built-in notion that equals metadata to XML.  So I feel it is 
actually constructive for our reasoning to get rid of the term 'metadata' with 
its numerous and in many cases vague/loaded interpretations, and consider an 
OAI-PMH.record to be structured data pertaining to an OAI-PMH.resource.  That is 
a quite unambiguous definition.

* I think OAI-PMH.item doesn't matter in this discussion as it merely is a 
gateway to OAI-PMH.records.  I feel we can loose that term too for our discussion.

=> I really don't think that OAI-PMH.identifier matters in any of this.  While 
the OAI-PMH.identifier is a crucial key for harvesting, it doesn't need to have 
anything to do with any 'real' identifiers, nor with the real world data. Agreed 
that in some implementations - for practical reasons - it does, but there is no 
reason for it to.  So we should not be distracted by it.  If we really need to 
accord meaning to OAI-PMH.identifier, we could consider it to be the identifier 
shared by all W3C.representations of a W3C.resource (~OAI-PMH.resource), as it 
acts as the gateway to all OAI-PMH.records pertaining to a OAI-PMH.resource. 
Even in this interpretation, the OAI-PMH.identifier doesn't come close to 
becoming the identifier of the OAI-PMH.resource, irrespective of what the exact 
nature of the OAI-PMH.record is.
- Cf. the W3C TAG distinction between URI for resource and URI for representation.
- Cf URI for resource == doi / URI for representation is OAI-PMH request using 
unrelated OAI-PMH.identifier

=> So, I think we lost quite some overhead in the above.  We are down to 
OAI-PMH.resource (rather undefined, how nice) and OAI-PMH.record (well defined, 
as being structured data pertaining to OAI-PMH.resource) to play with.  I think 
we can all go along with an interpretation that an oai_dc record is a 
W3C.representation of an OAI-PMH.resource.  I trust we would also agree this is 
the case for a special-purpose QDC record that 'models' the OAI-PMH.resource, 
and in doing so includes some links to datastreams of which that 
OAI-PMH.resource consists.  The step to a complex object solution (METS, DIDL, 
...) is really small from here as those indeed provide such by-reference 
technique to include datastreams, as well as by-value techniques to do so.  In 
addtion, some complex object approaches actually have a data model so that the 
required 'modelling' boils down to mapping a specific world view to the existing 
data model.

=> I very much share your opinion that directly shipping a 
datastream/representation of the resource in an 'unmodelled' manner smells 
really fishy, as it makes us loose the 'structured data pertaining to the 
resource' life buoy.

Jeez, this took me ages to write.  And now it is my turn to be proven wrong ;-)

I noticed that the datestamp field is usually used for harvesting date,
but some repositories use it for submission date. Is the dc:date field
used for publication date and submission date too? How could I
differentiate them? Does anyone could give me more information about it?

Thanks,

Within OAI the record datestamp MUST be the date of last update of
the metadata record. Otherwise incremental harveting will not work.

Within simple dc metadata there is no (accepted) way to differentiate
types of date in the dc:date fields. For e-prints, a good recommendation
is that in the RDN guidelines given by Andy Powell, Michael Day and Peter
Cliff:
http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/docs/simpledc-guidelines/#date

  dc:date (*) Eprint-specific Recommendation:

  The 'last-modified' date of the eprint and/or the date of its accession
  into the archive.

  The date should be formatted according to the W3C encoding rules for
  dates  and times [9] (a profile based on ISO 8601 known as W3C-DTF), for
  example:

  <dc:date>2000-12-25</dc:date>
  <dc:date>1999</dc:date>
  <dc:date>2003-01</dc:date>

  If necessary, repeat this element to provide both the last-modified date
  and the date of accession. The last-modified date will be assumed to be
  the more recent of the two dates. If only one date is provided, it will
  be assumed that the last-modified date and the date of accession are the

First at all, thanks a lot for the information. And I have a suggestion.

I know that OAI-PHM is a general protocol, not only for eprints. However I
think that the publication date is a *very* important information about an
eprint life-cycle. So I think that it should be shown explicitly through the
protocol.

Regards,
Evelyn.
