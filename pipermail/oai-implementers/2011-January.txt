Hi,
I am doing some research on using a sru server with a OAI interface and came across this email from Jeff. None of the links provided works thus I am unable to test any srw interface that would work with OAI.
Could you please help me. If you can send me correct link to the srw registry that would help.

Thanks,
Sonali

hi Sonali

i am not sure if this will help, but the NDLTD Union Archive of ETD 
metadata has both OAI-PMH and SRU interfaces. for details, see:
    http://www.ndltd.org/manage-etds/manage-etds

Hi,

geonetwork (http://geonetwork-opensource.org) has OAI and SRU interfaces,
amongst others.

best regards

Hello,
At CNRS, we currently develop the ISIDORE project with a web site in 
beta version : http://rechercheisidore.fr (french interface only for the 
moment). Inside, we "merge" OAI,RSS,RDFa results with SRU/SRW queries 
results. You can see the english description of the project at 
http://www.tge-adonis.fr/article/isidore-going-strenght-strength

Best,

St?phane.
