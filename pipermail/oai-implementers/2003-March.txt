Hi

We wanted to let everyone know that we have harvested and indexed all the
BioMed Central records available via OAI 2.0 into myOAI.

You can get to myOAI here:

    http://www.myoai.com/

In addition to being able to search the BioMed Central records, you can also
search on a number of other databases including arXiv, Chemistry Preprints,
Dspace, MIT theses, RePREc and more.

Feedback, comments and question are welcome.

Best regards

Francois

Hi

I just wanted to let everyone know that I have updated the Perl based
harvester on our download page.

You can download the harvester at:

    http://www.myoai.com/downloads/

Along with the usual slew of bug fixes and code clean ups, you can now
configure it to download specific sets and specific metadata from the
servers.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Questions on MARC21
Message-ID: <2861.128.82.7.73.1047331490.squirrel@www.cs.odu.edu>

Question #1:
I encountered a problem when I tried to make a MARC21 XML from a so-called
CASI metadata.

There are such tags in CASI metadata like:
<D700a,D700e,D719a,D729a,D719i,D719b,D729b(001)>,
<D700a,D700e,D719a,D729a,D719i,D719b,D729b(002)>,
<D700a,D700e,D719a,D729a,D719i,D719b,D729b(003)>...

(the number inside parentheses, 001, 002, 003..., indicates the multiple
occurence of the tag.)

I just wonder how to express them in MARC21?

I know one of them can be expressed in a sequential way as the following :

- <datafield ind1="" ind2="" tag="700">
  <subfield code="a">Whiton, J. C.</subfield>
  <subfield code="e" />
  </datafield>
- <datafield ind1="" ind2="" tag="719">
  <subfield code="a">NASA Marshall Space Flight Center</subfield>
  </datafield>
- <datafield ind1="" ind2="" tag="729">
  <subfield code="a" />
  </datafield>
- <datafield ind1="" ind2="" tag="719">
  <subfield code="i">Huntsville, AL United States</subfield>
  <subfield code="b">United States</subfield>
  </datafield>
- <datafield ind1="" ind2="" tag="729">
  <subfield code="b">ND736801</subfield>
  </datafield>

But what if there are more than one sets of the above. How can I indicate
than which fields are together in one group?

Question #2:
I have another question about MARC21. There is a <leader> field in MARC21,
which should have a value of 24 byte, telling some properties of the MARC
record.
Why this field is needed? is there any easy way to make the value of
<leader>?

Appreciate your help.

Okay, not sure if this will be useful to anyone, but I've written a TEI-Lite
to OAI Dublin Core transform that works for me.  It's not a complete transform,
but I think it's documented well enough for someone to extend it and make it
better.  Or, at the very least modify it to be useful for your own project.
Take a look at ftp://callimachus.library.emory.edu/pub/tei2dc/TEILite2DC.xsl.

Hi all, 

  I have coded OAI protocol for Digital library in ASP.NET. For implementing resumptionTokens, I am using cookies in the program. But when I tested the application in Repository Explorer, a tool, given in OAI web site (http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/cgi-bin/Explorer/2.0-1.45/testoai), my program fails when it comes to resumption token. I learnt that the tool does not allow cookies. So, is it ok for me to use cookies ? Is this tool used by majority of harvestors ? Can I rely on cookies ?

thanks very much,

Venu.

Hi

I am not sure I fully understand what you are doing here. If you are asking
whether you can put the resumption token in a cookie, the answer is yes, but
you will still need to put the resumption token in the actually content of
the reply as specified in the spec. The spec does not call for putting the
resumption token in a cookie, neither as harvester going to support that, at
least mine does not. Its just not in the spec.

OAI was implemented in such as way as to be self-contained and transport
independent, hence cookies are not part of it.

Cookies are an extension implemented by Web browsers, they're highly 
unlikely to be implemented by OAI harvesters.

You should encode all the information you require in the resumption 
token, which the harvester will use to request the next partial list 
from you.

All the best,
Tim.

Venu,

resumptionTokens are part of the OAI-PMH responses to harvesting requests.  They
are "in" the XML responses.  Expressing resumptionTokens using cookies is not
specified in the OAI-PMH, nor is it supported by harvesters.  Maybe I didn't
understand your use of cookies correctly, but if it is what I think it is
(expressing resumptionTokens as cookies) then it's not something you can do in
the OAI-PMH.

cheers

Whatever you feel comfortable with, if you have a big machine and a fast
pipe to the net, I would return larger chunks of data, on the order of 1MB
or larger, if you don¹t, I would return small chunks of data, say 100K or
less.

One think I would suggest you implement, if you have not already, is the
"Retry-After" to prevent badly behaved harvesters from swamping your system.

The main issue concerning the maximum size of responses seems to be the
size that XML parsers will readily handle. The maximum number of records
that should be returned thus depends partly on the size of each record.
Limiting response size to a few MB seems sensible at present. For
arXiv.org I return <=1500 records which is typically 2-3MB.

One can of course return many more identifiers in a ListIdentifiers
response then records in a ListRecords response within the same size
limit.

Cheers,
Simeon.

hi all,

  I am testing my OAI Implementation with OAI Repository Explorer http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/cgi-bin/Explorer/2.0-1.45/testoai . In ListIdentifiers, GetRecord responses, I could not understand why some of setSpecs are treated as errors. 

If setSpec does not have a value for a record, I am leaving it blank i.e. just <setSpec></setSpec>. But the repository says :

[Error] file4FVZBI:1:517: Datatype error: In element 'setSpec' : Value '' does not match regular expression facet '([A-Za-z0-9_!'$\(\)\+\-\.\*])+(:[A-Za-z0-9_!'$\(\)\+\-\.\*]+)*'..


Similarly, it gives the similar errors with some setSpecs like 'Network Exchange Theory' , 'Ztree code and templates'  etc. Please inform me how to go about this.

Thanks,

Venu.

Venu,
 
You should omit the setSpec for records that have none rather than creating
an empty element. Regarding "Network Exchange Theory", etc, the problem
appears to be the presence of spaces, which isn't allowed by the xsd. I
suggest you change spaces to plus signs instead. Since '+' is the URL
encoded form for spaces, you may be able to avoid unnecessary character
substitutions when you display them in a browser (e.g. via XSLT).

hi

firstly, the "Test Result: OK" refers to the previous test, which 
apparently succeeded.

the error you got means that the tester obtained a record from the set 
"DL:Kwords:1", which is apparently a setSpec returned by ListSets. 
setSpec in the header corresponding to that identifier contained 
"Economics" instead of "DL:Kwords:1", which should have been there (at 
the least).

i think it may be possible that you are confusing setSpec with setName - 
the former is a machine-readable unique identifier for the set, while 
the latter is a human-readable description

hope this helps ...

ttfn,
----hussein

Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE98342D14@OA3-SERVER.oa.oclc.org>

I have a situation where the metadata I'm making available via OAI has a
DOCTYPE associated with it. Although it's not part of the original document,
there fortunately happens to be an existing XML Schema that I can insert to
allow me to associate it with an OAI metadataPrefix. Nevertheless, it would
be nice if I could pass along the DOCTYPE information as well, rather than
discard it. My guess is that even if I could, a typical OAI harvester would
ignore it anyway. Any suggestions?

There are probably others on this list with more recent practical
experience of this than me, but for some basic suggested mappings, see
appendix B3 of the EAD Application Guidelines

http://lcweb.loc.gov/ead/ag/agappb.html#sec3

Note that an EAD document contains descriptions of the EAD document
itself and descriptions of units of archival material, so you need to be
clear about which resource(s) you wish your OAI DC record to describe.
And if it is the archival material, you may end up generating many
(possibly thousands) of simple DC records for the content of a single
EAD document.

I suspect if you enquired on the EAD listserv, you might find someone
had an XSLT transform. I'd qualify that by saying that EAD is quite
flexible, and there are (often quite significant) variations in the way
different implementers use EAD to encode their archival finding aids, so
you may find that any supplied transform needs some customisation for
your EAD dataset - and if that dataset is drawn from multiple sources
using varying encoding conventions the complexity of a
"one-size-fits-all" transform rapidly increases, I think.

I'm not saying it's impossible, just that it may not be straightforward
;-)

There's a good treatment of these issues in

http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=544255&coll=portal&dl=ACM

Hi Jiann-Ming,

We at the UIUC have developed a mapping of EAD to OAI both for the 
collection level and for the subordinate component levels.  You can find an 
XSLT that implements that mapping at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/uilib-ead/.  Chris Prom and I also presented 
a paper on the subject which can be found at 
http://dli.grainger.uiuc.edu/publications/jcdl2002/p14-prom.pdf

Chris is also actively engaged on additional research on this subject; some 
of which can be found at http://web.library.uiuc.edu/ahx/workpap/

Regarding ZMARCO, of which I am the author: unfortunately we have not been 
able to get it to work with Voyager, at least not our Voyager implementation 
at UIUC.  This is primarily because of a limit of 10,000 records per result 
set that Voyager has.  If you wanted to mess with the ZMARCO code you might 
be able to get it to work.  However, we have not been very successful in 
porting ZMARCO to other Z39.50 servers.  At one point we did have it 
experimentally working with the UIUC's old DRA system (and some other DRA 
systems), but alas we are no longer running DRA at UIUC.

If you would like to correspond regarding ideas for getting ZMARCO to work, 
I would be happy to exchange ideas.  We still have a research project here 
in which we are exploring interoperability issues between Z39.50 and OAI.

Kind regards,
	Tom

hi

(this should have gone to oai-implementors so i am cross-posting it)

regarding the VTOAI code i published a while ago, there isn't much it 
does that can lead to a scalability problem. offhand, the only time a 
large chunk of data is needed is when you ListRecords (and maybe 
ListIdentifiers).

in any event, i do not suggest 10k records - what is the byte size of a 
typical response ? 30MB ? thats really too much ...

the memory needed to store and process that is probably the cause of the 
problem from the VTOAI perspective, and also from the perspective of 
some XML parsers. instead, try 1000-1500 records. remember also there 
are some potential service providers like me down here in South Africa 
who would almost never be able to get a 30MB chunk at most times of the 
day over our network :)

lastly, fwiw, FastCGI won't help for this problem. but if you want to 
try a really obscure solution, the code has an internal representation 
of a record that you might try replacing with a pointer of some sort. 
that way you don't simultaneously store lots of records in memory but 
you still have enough info to generate the record in XML when required.

hope this helps ... if you want more details about anything really 
specific, send me a direct email.

hi Jeff

so why would you want the DOCTYPE retained? what does it contain that 
could be useful to others?

also, if it's a DTD, i suspect that once you embed this within an OAI 
response, the "DOCTYPE" will/should change.

Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE98342D1A@OA3-SERVER.oa.oclc.org>

Hi Hussein,

In this case, my "metadata" is actually XHTML. The W3C validator at
http://validator.w3.org/ refuses to validate an XHTML document unless a
DOCTYPE is present. Perhaps part of the problem is that this validator
doesn't recognize XML Schemas as an alternative. If I can't include the
DOCTYPE, it would be necessary for OAI clients to be intelligent enough to
insert one if they want to make use of the records in a way that will
satisfy the W3C validator.

As if that's not bad enough, this validator barfs on XML Schemas even if a
DOCTYPE is present. This means that OAI clients will not only have to insert
their own DOCTYPE, they will also have to strip the xmlns:xsi and
xsi:schemaLocation attributes from their records before they can validate
successfully.

Ultimately, I guess, the real answer is that the W3C validator just isn't up
to snuff.

Jeff

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303311038240.21390-100000@ice.cs.cornell.edu>

OAI Metadata Harvesting Workshop at JCDL2003
--------------------------------------------

Call for participation
----------------------

This workshop will bring together people with Open Archives Initiative
(OAI) metadata harvesting experience to discuss problems, their
solutions, and to identify best practices. The focus will be on near- to
medium-term practical issues. Participants will have the opportunity to
discuss problems or raise issues that they have encountered and will
benefit from the shared experience of the other participants.

The workshop will combine and distill the OAI harvesting knowledge and
experience of the participants to detail 1) best practices and existing
solutions to particular harvesting problems; and 2) unresolved problems
and issues with current implementations, the specification, or
limitations of version 2.0 the OAI protocol for metadata harvesting
(OAI-PMH). The conclusions of the workshop will be disseminated to the
wider OAI community.

This will be a full-day workshop with an emphasis on discussion.  It
will be held on Saturday 31 May 2003 (the day after the main sessions of
the JCDL conference). Participation is open to those who have OAI
harvesting experience. Participants will be expected describe their OAI
harvesting experience in a brief (1 or 2 paragraph) position statement,
and to propose a topic or topics for discussion.  Selected participants
will be invited to present a short paper to describe and seed discussion
on a topic they proposed.

Participants must register though the JCDL registration system. For
further information please see:

Subject: [OAI-implementers] oai response XML Schema checking
Message-ID: <20030331193059.GF10806@openlib.org>

   Folks,

  I want to check my OAI repository regularly, by
  going through all the responses that it
  can generate and check them one by one. I had
  gotten Xerces java 1 to run, but I can no longer
  do it. I have played with the flags that they
  suggest in the documentation, and either it checks
  only the well-formedness of the response or it 
  comes up with an error that says

Document root element "{1}", must match DOCTYPE root "{0}".

  presumably suggesting that there is something
  wrong with the namespaces. Same thing with xerces-2_4_0.
  The command that I give is

CLASSPATH=/home/oaiadm/java/xerces-2_4_0/xercesImpl.jar:/home/oaiadm/java/xerces
-2_4_0/xercesSamples.jar:/home/oaiadm/java/xerces-2_4_0/xml-apis.jar:/home/oaiad
m/java/xerces-2_4_0/xmlParserAPIs.jar:; export CLASSPATH ; java dom.Counter -v /
var/tmp/Identifiers.amf.xml 

  The file passes with xsv on the web interface,
  but I can hardly use that to bulk check, can't I?
  I need something that works on linux.

  In general, what validation tools use folks out
  there to check their repositories?

I downloaded the files from sourceforge and tried using the ead-dc.xsl transform
with Hussein Suleman's XMLFile OAI provider.  It passes all but the GetRecord
test of the Repository Explorer with a "XML Schema validation failed."  I think
it has something to do with the </rdf:RDF> tags.  What are these tags for?
Thanks for any insight.

Hi Jiann-Ming,

Sorry for not being more clear:  Our XSLT produces Qualified Dublin Core as 
RDF/XML which should mostly conform to the guidelines for "Expressing 
Qualified Dublin Core in RDF / XML" 
(http://www.dublincore.org/documents/2002/04/14/dcq-rdf-xml/).  This is the 
reason for the rdf-prefixed tags.  This format cannot be used directly with 
OAI, mostly because of the lack of an XML Schema.

The RDF/XML output of our transformation will need to be further processed 
(dumbed-down) to produced simple, unqualified DC before it can be used with 
OAI.  We also have an XSLT transformation which is not posted on SourceForge 
for doing this.  If you like I can also post this transformation which takes 
the qualified DC RDF/XML and turns it into OAI compatible DC.

Sorry for the confusion.
	Tom
