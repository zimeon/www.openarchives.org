Hello everybody,

I am starting to implement the oai-pmh protocol. I would like to know how you have dealt with the repeated arguments in the request. 

The response is supposed to show an error whenever I send a string like this:

http://... ...oai.php?verb=Identify&verb=Identify

but I dont know how can I detect this errors.

Thanks...

Hi,

this seems to me to be a CGI problem, nothing to do with OAI. Depending 
on which language / toolkit you use, you access the URL parameters in 
different ways.

The easiest thing is probably to parse the query String yourself
using a tokenizer and to check if there are any duplicate parameters.
If your library / language provides access to the URL params in, say,
an array, you could also loop through it.

best
Timo
