Subject: [OAI-implementers] Announcing ZMARCO 0.1 (Z39.50, MARC record, OAI data provider)
Message-ID: <3D21C32F.690BBA0F@uiuc.edu>

Hi all,

We have just made a beta release of ZMARCO, our Z39.50, MARC record, OAI
data provider. It is available from SourceForge at
http://zmarco.sourceforge.net/ -- from this page refer to the README for
details.

ZMARCO is an Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
(OAI-PMH) 2.0 compliant data provider. The 'Z' in ZMARCO stands for Z39.50;
'MARC' stands for MAchine-Readable Cataloging; and the 'O' stands for OAI,
as in the Open Archives Inititive. Essentially ZMARCO allows MARC records
which are already available through a Z39.50 server to relatively easily be
made available via the OAI-PMH.  Among the supported metadata formats are
Dublin Core, MARCXML, and MODS.

We have currently only tested ZMARCO using a subset (about 3,000,000
records) from the University of Illinois' online library catalog, and it
works OK (at least with only us harvesting it).  If anyone tries it with
other Z39.50 servers, please let us know how it works.

>From the README file:

Platform and Environment
------------------------
  Windows 2000 
  Internet Information Server 5 (IIS 5) 
  Active Server Pages (ASP) 
  Accessible Z39.50 Server supporting the following features: 
    USmarc Record Syntax (may be extended to support other MARC syntaxes
      in the future) 
    Bib-1 Use Attribute 31, Publication Date (Year)
    Bib-1 Use Attribute 12, Control Number 
    No limit on the number search hits available for one query 

Kind Regards,
	Tom

Message-ID: <1360.24.214.27.68.1025724334.squirrel@aztec.lib.utk.edu>

  We are just starting to work with OAI at the Univ. of Tenn. Library
and I have put my first try at writing a provider on line.
  This implementation does not have resumption tokens in it and it 
expects sets to be implemented in a certain way. We are developing
it along with a oai_dc editor, which will itself be an extension of
a METS-like administrative database.  We plan to eventually have
several conversion or crosswalk scripts in the system as well.
  At present all that is online is the provider, which can be run with
a standard install of RedHat rpms of MySQL and PHP and no other
required packages.
 The information on all the different pieces will be available on the
info page at

http://diglib.lib.utk.edu/oai/

  Any comments or suggestions are extremely welcome.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Beta public interface up for playing
Message-ID: <20020704170747.D10631@io.mds.rmit.edu.au>

I am not sure how much use this will be, but I was surprised how useful
people found my old web page of errors I had trying to harvest people's
collections.

We are building an application on top of the system we sell here.
I will admit up front it is in part advertising ('buy our product').
So there is ("buy") some subliminal ("BUY OUR PRODUCT") advertising
on the first ("buy") page. I am sure it will be extrememly effective :-)
But the OAI application itself is not actually a product at this stage.

So I am really advertising (err - announcing?) this as a replacement
to the old page of harvesting results that I used to maintain.
This is still a work in progress, but there is nothing like
putting something in a real life situation to find the problems!

If you want a look try

    http://inquirion.com:8123/

I have defined one collection so far, and grabbed all the old OAI
sites I used to crawl (probably out of date now) and loaded them up.
I have only tried to crawl a small number of them so far though! (I will
try others incrementally). We don't have the automatic harvesting
going yet so I have to manually trigger a harvest for a site.
(If you want me to try your site in particular I am happy to do
so, after which you can look at the log messages yourself online.)
I am sure there will need to be lots of tweaking to make the log
contents more useful.

Any comments on presentation or what sort of messages to go into
the log would be greatly appreciated.

It will also allow harvesting of what I collect via OAI. The baseURL
will be http://inquirion.com:8123/oai/OAI. But its currently broken
(ListRecords does not even work for some reason). It was working
before, so its a transitory problem.

There is also a URL based query interface:

    http://inquirion.com:8123/query/OAI?ccl=%3F

Parameters in summary are:
    ccl - ISO 8777 CCL query (%3F = '?' which means match everything)
    	title=science and creator=ed?
    recnum - starting record to get (from 1)
    maxrecs - how many to get (default 10)
    rs - Z39.50 record syntax (sutrs, grs1, xml)
    ss - stylesheet (summary and detailed are supported at the moment)

There is also a static HTML page at:
    http://inquirion.com:8123/static/query.html

This page is basically a fill in form that jumps off to the above
query based URL.

There is also a Z39.50 server behind the scenes, but I am guess most
people on this list won't care that much about it.

I am going to be reinstalling, reharvesting, etc multiple times as bugs
are found. So don't plan to OAI harvest from this unless you are just
testing your code.

Note also there is no data that we create. I am just stealing everyone
else's data. This really is intended as one means of testing your
site - that is a public interface to the logs we are collecting when
we try to harvest your site, just like the old web page I used to
maintain.

I am actually going on leave tomorrow, so any problems I may not
respond to immediately. Maybe I should not be releasing it yet,
but its fun anyway! :-)

Alan

ps: If you want me to add a new site or try your site, I will endevour
to do so. We plan to start automatically harvesting sites periodically
some time soon.

Message-ID: <036401c22379$6b71cbb0$14414e98@Shrek>

Hi Alan,

I haven't noticed any replies to your mail, so I'll throw in my tuppence
worth:

1) Not as far as I know. And, IMHO, it is very unlikely there ever will be
(knowing how big a response set is does not help the fact that the entire
response has to be harvested, so why does it matter?).

2) Versioning is an issue that hasn't been addressed by the OAI community? I
have made the assumption that the top-level element of an OAI response
contains a namespace identifier which can be resolved to a version. I have a
table of XMLNS -> version (e.g.
'http://www.openarchives.org/oai/1.0/oai_getrecord' => '1.0'), with some
capability to account for variability in implementation (e.g. convert to
lowercase, remove tailing /).

3) "Whats in a name" etc. As we are currently in an ambiguous area between
1.x and 2.0, and with high variability between implementations, I'm relying
on the baseURL to identify repositories. For Celestial I'm not thinking too
hard about record identifier collisions (Citebase only talks to 3
repositories, so any problems can be hand-resolved).

All the best,
Tim.

Dear all,

>From the protocol doc:
"o the response containing the incomplete list that completes the list

I'm not sure whether this means the last page "must", "should", or "can"
include an empty resumptionToken - it's not mentioned in migration?

Of the three initial OAI 2 implementations I've harvested none implemented
this behaviour.

The most generic way I can see to get "around" this behaviour is to
silently drop empty resumption tokens and ignore noRecordsMatch.

<rant>
noRecordsMatch should not be an error (and I'll keep saying it until
doomsday)

an empty resumptionToken is just plain wrong ("The format of the
resumptionToken is not defined by the OAI-PMH and should be considered
opaque by the harvester", but OAI-PMH would appear to "define" an empty
resumptionToken - as Homer puts it, "Doh!".)

it means "must".  and thanks for pointing this out.  we must make this clear in
the spec.

I am not sure what your problem with this approach is.  By providing an empty
resumptionToken element to the harvester, the repository indicates that the
response to the original harvesting request is complete.  It's similar to
approaches taken in search&retrieval protocols where it is specified that
results 45 till 60 out of a result set of 60 have been delivered.  Only, in the
OAI-PMH such an approach can't work because the size of "result-set" can change
while the harvester is harvesting it (see
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#Idempotency).  So, I
hope that -- in the same way that S&R clients can check whether the result-set
is complete, by comparing 45-60 with 60 -- a harvester can check whether the XML
resumptionToken element is empty or not.  If it's empty, the harvester shouldn't
issue a new harvesting request, and as a result it will not receive a
norecordsMatch reponse.

I understand that the same result could have been achieved by not providing a
resumptionToken element at all in the last incomplete list.  In that case the
spec would have read: all incomplete lists must contain a resumpionToken
element, except for the incomplete list that completes the reponse which must
not contain a resumptionToken element - "Doh!" .

*Personally* I tend to find the time you do big harvests is the first
time you add a new big site to your set of sites you harvest from.
Adding a new site for the first time is the most likely time things
will fail. Hence I tend to watch it for the first while to make sure
things are moving along. For this reason, our harvester implementation
outputs running messages (a '.' per record, when POST requests are
sent etc) just to show things are happening. The administrator of
the our application can then view these trace messages. Errors are
logged permanently in a database for future reference, but trace messages
we just keep around during a harvest so an administrator can feel
confident something is happening. Since a human is watching, the %
completion is useful.

But I agree, its not an earth shattering feature of OAI. But I do
find it useful. (I can easily compute after the first few % messages
how long the harvest is going to take to complete.)

The protocol has versioning addressed fine. My question was more that
as a *developer* I was interested in finding out which sites were at
which protocol levels. I think you were referring back to my question
about the list of servers on the OAI site. My comment was more "hey,
for developers, wouldn't it be useful if the sites showed what version
they supported so I didn't have to manually try each one, one-by-one,
to find a 2.0 server". No big deal.

Thanks for the reply

For what its worth, I will agree with you until doomsday too.
Its not that hard to work around, but its conceptually quite wrong
to me too. Our solution was in our error processing code to put
in a special case to ignore that error as if it never occurred.

I thought the reason for allowing resumptionToken to have empty content
was so that the attributes of the element could always be present:
expirationDate, completeListSize, cursor. That is, so the last request
was not a special case where these attributes would be missing.

Hi Alan,

The repository explorer (thanks Hussein!) lists repositories in versions
1.0,1.1, and 2.0. That list isn't checked (?) so some of those base URLs may
be updated/missing, but is a good starting point for developers.
Otherwise I'm working on producing an OAI 2.0 mirror of every OAI repository
there is ...

I would be interested to know why you think versioning has been addressed?
For two agents to talk together in an any-version world there has to be a
consistent method for getting the protocol version, regardless of the actual
version implemented. While the version is wrapped up in an OAI Identify
response it's likely to "jump around" within the XML between versions.
Assuming the element will always be "protocolVersion" a node search could be
performed, but there's nothing to stop a repository putting a
"protocolVersion" element inside a description.

Which is why I look at the top level element's namespace, which should be
more reliable than a protocolVersion anyway (certainly I've forgotten to
"roll-over" the version number before, but the XML won't validate unless the
namespace is correct).

All the best,
Tim.

I think you are correct that an empty token was introduced to allow
cursor/list size in the final incomplete list.

The problem is this is altering the use of a mandatory component (resumption
token) for an optional one, cursors, list size. As I said in my previous
mail I don't think cursors/list size will be used in the majority of cases,
so an empty resumption token (which just looks odd) is mandated to account
for the minority situation.

Perhaps, in hindsight, mixing cursors and list sizes with resumption token
was not the best solution?
(It always struck me that putting a cursor at the end of the response, which
is actually the value at the beginning was slightly odd)

<ListRecords cursor="50" completeListSize="200000"> anyone?

Tim.

Message-ID: <706871B20764CD449DB0E8E3D81C4D4302E6E143@opus.cs.cornell.edu>

Dear all,

Recently there has been a rash of "please unsubscribe me" messages
posted to the entire oai-general and/or oai-implementers lists.  Please
DO NOT post these messages to the entire list.  It effectively spams the
mailboxes of many people worldwide who use these lists to keep track of
oai related activities.  I don't think anyone is anxious to add to the
spam overload on the net.

The proper way to unsubscribe to the lists is to visit either:

http://oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu/mailman/listinfo/oai-general or
http://oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu/mailman/listinfo/oai-implementers

Go to the bottom of that page to the section labeled oai-{general or
implementers} subscribers, enter your email address in the box under
"change your subscriptions options".  Another page will then come up
with which you can cancel your subscription, upon entering your list
password.  If you have forgotten your list password, you can also use
that page to retrieve it.

If you have problems with this procedure, then send mail ONLY to
openarchives@openarchives.org.

Again, DO NOT post unsubscribe messages to the entire list.

Thanks,

Carl Lagoze

Message-ID: <20020709111509.F2928@io.mds.rmit.edu.au>

I was just re-reading resumptionToken in the spec I downloaded
a while back and I think the wording of resumptionToken is not
100% clear. (Others have probably said similar things recently.)

When an incomplete list is returned it says use resumptionToken.
It also says "the response containg the incomplete list that completes
the list includes an empty resumptionToken element". No must/should/etc.

Also, what about if the first response is a complete response? Should/must
you return an empty resumption token? Or no resumption token?

The XML Schema says the resumptionToken element is optional in responses
implying it can be omitted sometimes. But it was not 100% clear to me
formally when it can be omitted.

'must', I think this was added after the last discussion.

I'd say no resumptionToken because there were no incomplete list 
responses.

This is not enforced via the schema. I don't think there would be any way 
to specify these semantics with a schema.

Yes, the language was fixed in a recent update to the specification
language (document version dated 2002/07/05T16:47:00Z).  As worded now,
it should clearly state that any use of a resumption token other than as
the closing response to a set of incomplete lists is illegal.

Read it again Alan and let us know if it is not still clear.

I guess this is what the Academic Metadata Format (AMF) people have been
trying to do?

  http://amf.openlib.org/doc/ebisu.html

I don't have an objection to what you suggest.

Just to clarify the rationale behind my suggestions about the current
oai_dc defaults in the eprints.org software...

1) all eprint archives that support OAI-PMH *must* support oai_dc (to be
compliant with the protocol)

2) we might as well make the default configuration of oai_dc in the
eprints.org software generate metadata that is as useful as possible (even
though it might not be as useful as some other, richer, format).

3) the oai_dc metadata generated by the eprints.org software should
conform to DCMI semantics and guidelines on best practice.

That's all my suggestions were trying to do.  I hope this makes sense?

Andy.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Lists/Flow-control/Emptiness
Message-ID: <05a601c228e3$639d0fc0$14414e98@Shrek>

Dear all,

1) empty resumption token in complete list

Where a result set is returned without flow control (e.g. a small list), can
an empty resumption token be appended to this list, even if it is
"complete"?
(The logic to cope with determining the difference between the completing
list and a complete list is not trivial)

2) no-records+resumption token

An empty list won't validate, e.g. ListRecords without any records.

It is possible that flow control may result in an incomplete list that does
not contain any records, e.g.:
Harvester requests (until=2002-03-04)
Performs flow control, gets to last page-1
Records on last page move out of result set
Harvester requests final token, for which no records can be returned

An empty token by itself will not validate, and "noRecordsMatch" means that
no records could be returned for the query, not for the resumption token.

Change schema or return noRecordsMatch?

Regards,
Tim

I guess its not explicitly stated in the protocol as "must not"... 

But resumptionTokens are for incomplete lists, and including an empty
resumptionToken would seem likely to confuse harvesters.  Or maybe it
wouldn't confuse them, but at a miminum it is superfluous (below).

check for the existence of a resumptionToken in the CGI vars.  if the
harvester passed in a resumptionToken, then it is the final incomplete
list.  if not, it is a complete list all by itself.

this would seem to be covered in section 3.5.1:

[...] In cases where there are substantial changes to the repository, it
may be appropriate for a repository to return a badResumptionToken error,
signaling that the harvester should restart the list request sequence.


if you have a resumptionToken *and* no records match, then something ugly
did happen:  either the harvester is trying to "forge" the
resumptionTokens, or the repository had (potentially significant) changes.

I think returning both noRecordsMatch and badResumptionToken would be the
safe way to handle it.

Michael

I just threw your baseURL at 
http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/cgi-bin/Explorer/oai2.0/testoai
and it seems to find no objection to most of the Identify response,
the error is just the oai-identifier part:

[Error] filehhJHBD:21:63: Datatype error: In element 'repositoryIdentifier': Value 'dlpscoll' does not match regular expression facet '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*(\.[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]+)+'..
[Error] filehhJHBD:23:71: Datatype error: In element 'sampleIdentifier' : Value 'oai:dlpscoll:YEATS-YC023' does not match regular expression facet 'oai:[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*(\.[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]+)+:[a-zA-Z0-9\-_\.!~\*'\(\);/\?:@&=\+$,%]+'..

In the v2 oai-identifier spec, the repositoryIdentifier must be domain 
name based (see:
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-oai-identifier.htm)
and must include at least one period. Your repositoryIdentifier 
'dlpscoll' does not match the pattern. (Hence also the sampleIdentifier 
also fails to match the pattern)

The v1 and v2 oai-identifier specs are not compatible as pointed out in 
section 2.4 of the v2 oai-identifier spec.

Cheers,
Simeon.

If the repository implementation is simpler by always including a resumption
token element, and it doesn't cause a problem with the protocol, then it
should be ok to do this?

I came up with the same solution. But I wouldn't class this as "trivial", as
the logic intersects with other aspects of the protocol (below...).

Ok. This is kinda "overloading" errors though. An error hasn't occurred - a
change occurred in the repository that resulted in an empty list.

noRecordsMatch is defined as resulting from the original query, not as a
side-effect of flow-control, and the resumption token in question is valid?

So logic is now:

if( no records ) {
    if( CGI resumption token ) {
        add noRecordsMatch ("no records match resumption token")
        add badResumptionToken ("because it doesn't match any records")
    } else {
        add noRecordsMatch
    }
} else if( no resumption Token ) {
    add empty token
}

All the best,
Tim.

I agree with Tim that using badResumptionToken is a bit of dangerous here.
It looks like this situation most likely will happend at the end of
harvesting, a badResumptionToken will simply invalidate all previous works
in same session. For a large archive, it means a lot of work.

i suppose its a moot point:  for good or bad, its already in version 2.0
of the protocol

yeah, its not really an error; but "error" in the protocol doc has always
been shorthand for "errors & exceptions" (cf. title of section 3.6).  this
is clearly an exception condition.

>

badResumptionToken is defined as:  "The value of the resumptionToken
argument is invalid or expired.  "

in this case, the repository has simply decided to expire the
resumptionToken, which is well within its right (see 3.5.1)

(from Liu):

yes, that could be the case.  of course, this condition was always present
-- even 1.1, if a harvester recvd a resumptionToken, and if it got an
empty list when it used that resumptionToken, then something funny
happened at the repository didn't it?  the fact that this condition was
prevoiusly more slightly obscured doesn't remove the danger.

rewriting the block inside the first if yields a more compact:

if (no results) {
	error(noRecordsMatch);
	if (CGI resumptionToken) {  	# 1
		error(badResumptionToken)
	}
} else if ( no resumptionToken && CGI resumptionToken ) { # 2
	empty resumptionToken
}

#1 handles the case where you want to flag if your incomplete list has no
results.  #2 handles distinguishing between the final incomplete list and
a complete list.  I don't think this would make my top 10 list of "things
wrong in OAI"  ;-)

	Hi Herbert,

	Sorry for the slow reaction and let me come back to the question
of exchanging citation metadata.

	After checking out the LoC MARC21 guidelines, it is not obvious at
all in which MARC fields the sub elements of a citation succesfully
parsed (eg: journal name, pagination, volume, issue, possibly report
number, or URL) should go. That was our motivation to put them (maybe
temporarily) in a non standard MARC field (999C5). We have also seen that the Swiss IDS
library consortium is using its own non standard solution for keeping
reference subfields within MARC21. Please let me know if we are
actually missing a LoC definition for citations... it would be far the
best for us.

	Meanwhile, we are quite favorable in testing the OpenURL solution
for distributing our parsed citations. Would you be interested in testing
the transformation of our MARC21 XML (999C5 only) into OpenURL syntax ? Or
do you know someone who would be interested in doing this ?

	Cheers,

		JY.

Many search engines can do exactly this, return no elements for the
last chunk. Calculating the exact number of hits can be quite expensive,
so they may over or underestimate the number of elements which will
should be returned.

Effectively, the results are an indefinite-length list, and the true
length isn't known until the whole list is read. This is because some
elements may be marked for deletion, but not actually removed until
a later cleanup. It is cheap to return the length of the list, but
expensive to walk the whole list and count only the non-deleted items.

Hello Everybody,
=20
For the past week I've been upgrading our OAI implementation from
version 1.1 to 2.0 and I came across a few issues.
First of all, I understand from the protocol specs that there is no room
for error reporting other than the predefined errors, I find this quite
annoying, since I'd also like to report if there's for example an
internal database error, or an error while reading the initialization
file. I'd very much like to see the protocol be extended with some room
for this, or if anybody else has an idea about it, please let me know.
=20
Then there is the issue of reporting in which sets a record occurs. In
our implementation we create a set by selecting a number of record
numbers and writing these to a file (including a setName and setSpec of
course). When the ListSets verb gets used, it just reads all these files
from disc and puts out the spec and name.
Later, when for example all records from a particular set get fetched
(ListRecords with set=3D...), we just read all the record numbers from =
the
file (and use them to read from the database).
With version 2.0 this won't work properly anymore, since we'd have to
read through all the existing "set files", to find out in which sets
aparticular record occurs when it is fetched without a set specified
(with GetRecord). When you have only a few small sets, it's not much of
a problem to read them into memory while initializing the program. But
when they increase in number and/or size this of course creates a
performance problem.
So my question is, what is the precise use of this new "feature" in OAI
(of reporting all sets a record occurs in)?
=20
Allright, that's it! Thanks for your time.

This allows the set hierachy to be more easily mirrored/federated. In OAI
1.x the harvester has to query each set to recreate the set hierachy.


In terms of implementation I suggest creating a cached copy of the record
headers (with identifier, datestamp, and setSpecs), which can then be
returned for GetRecord, ListIdentifiers and ListRecords.

All the best,
Tim Brody

Yes, which results in a minimum number of records that have to be
fetched, when you would use the setSpec in the reply to GetRecord, you
would have to fetch every single record, instead of just all the records
that appear in a set.
I don't see how this extra functionality could enhance the mirroring of
sets.
Besides, I would think that you would like to define sets without having
to change the records that go into those sets. Presuming you don't want
to do change the records, you would always have the same problem as I
do, no matter how you represent your sets.

I'd think that using the ListSets followed by a ListRecords on every set
would be the nicest and most efficient way to (for example) mirror a
site.

Also, if a set represents a meaningful relation between the records in
it, it would be logical to first query for the sets and then to get the
records from a set you're interested in. The other way around doesn't
make any sense, since you can't search for records on anything but their
Identifier.

Thanks for your reaction, awaiting more :)

Cheers,
Jozef Kruger

The v2 specification permits complete harvesting of all set information
with just one ListRecords request (with no setSpec). Each record is
harvested precisely once, the header contains all set information. This is
efficient.
 
A change in the set membership of a record is a change in the record. The
datestamp should be changed.

I each record were in an average of (n) sets then this would result in
harvesting each record (n+1) times (one for each set plus once with
no setspec). That does not sound efficient to me.

Bear in mind that sets are designed to permit selective harvesting and the
semantics of sets is not defined within the protocol (use of sets will
likely require direct communication between DP and SP, or community
agreement). The exception to this is mirroring where a mirror might
aim to preserve all set membership information without understanding it.

Unless a repository has some particular application that requires part of
its contents to be harvested then I think it should not, in general,
create an arbitrary collection of sets representing a subject
classification or such. The example I know best is arXiv.org which is
divided into different areas, historically NCSTRL harvested only the 'cs'
(Computer Science) portion of arXiv -- sets provide a way to support this
functionality.

Remember that sets are optional! If they are difficult to implement and
there is no well defined need then I suggest that repositories do not
implement them. For arXiv I think we have a need and I have gone to the
trouble of building and maintaining an extra index similar to the one Tim
described.

Simeon.

I think database errors and such are simply outside of OAI-PMH. If your
database is not working then you do not have an OAI server. HTTP provides
appropriate error codes (say 503 Service Unavailable) and you may include
a text message with such a return which will help with debugging. You can
also return a Retry-After with some long interval (say 1 day) in the hope
that the repository operator will fix the problem in time for an
intelligent harvester to try again.

Cheers,

Subject: [OAI-implementers] metadataPrefix and the returned XML records
Message-ID: <20020724171906.H24626@io.mds.rmit.edu.au>

Hi all,

This may be a stupid question, but its one that I never really worried
about before - it sort of does not matter, but am curious to know the
"why" etc.

When doing a ListRecords etc, you specify the metadataPrefix. All servers
must support "oai_dc", but you can have other ones.

The returned records are of course XML encoded. Possible XML is

    <oai_dc:dc 
	    xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" 
	    xmlns:DC="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
	    xmlns:dcxml="http://purl.org/dc/xml/"
	    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
	    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ 
		http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd">

	<DC:title>...</DC:title>
	...

    </oai_dc:dc>

Is there any requirement that the XML prefix name in the returned XML
be the same as the metadataPrefix requested? For example, could I have
said

    <XYZZY:dc 
	    xmlns:XYZZY="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" 
	    xmlns:DC="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
	    xmlns:dcxml="http://purl.org/dc/xml/"
	    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
	    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ 
		http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd">

	<DC:title>...</DC:title>
	...

    </XYZZY:dc>

The URI of XYZZY still identifiers the OAI DC format, but the root element
name is no longer oai_dc. When dealing in XML with namespaces, the
prefix name should not be significant - its the URI associated with
the prefix that is important.

I could read the spec, but I am actually more curious about what is
in people's minds. I can understand it possibily being a historical
issue. Or a "its good to use the same name" etc. I have no objections
using the same name, just more curious about the history of it in
case there is some subtle aspect that had not registered before.

I also some people wanting to define a new XML structure to use for
records, and I was wanting to make sure I did not make a bad suggestion
for the metadataPrefix name, or go against convention etc. Maybe the
implementors notes has a section on how to select "good" metadataPrefix
names.

Ok, maybe I should go and read the spec first. But I have typed
up all this mail now so I am going to send it anyway! :-)

Thanks!

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.21.0207240921290.15646-100000@sun8.loc.gov>

The following message was issued internally at LC from the Integrated
Library Systems (ILS) office.  The new service was announced at ALA and
has been disseminated to the cataloging community.  I thought that members
of WWIN and the OAI implementers list might also be interested in access
to the resource.

========

     On July 1, 2002, LC made its authority data available via the Web.
 This service, known as LC Authorities, provides access to LC's name,
subject, and title cataloging authority records, (including series
authority records) for search, display, and download.  The address for
this interface to LC's Database is: http://authorities.loc.gov   LC
Authorities is intended to be a resource for technical services
librarians engaged in cataloging and other activities that benefit from
authority control, cross references, and standardized vocabulary.
     Not included with this release are Z39.50 functionality; the full
MARC 21 character set for display and download of authority data; and
the approximately 2,300 subject subdivision records in the Library of
Congress Subject Heading file. LC will collaborate with Endeavor
Information Systems, Inc., our ILS vendor, to add Z39.50 functionality
and these other features in a future release.  Z39.50 is an information
retrieval (client/server-based) protocol that supports searching and
retrieving of information among remote databases.
     LC Authorities is intended to be a permanent service, offered free
of charge to users.  During the first phase of this implementation LC
will be gathering feedback from users to evaluate its usefulness and
determine how to improve its features.  Users should send comments to:
ils@loc.gov   A PowerPoint presentation on LC Authorities is
available at:  http://lcweb.loc.gov/ils/ALA02Arv.PPT 


P.S.  I also received a copy of a 'weblog' by Gary Price that includes
sample searches to help folks try out this vast file.

Web Resource of the Week
Invisible Web Database

New From The Library of Congress, Free Web Access to the LC Authority
Files

At the beginning of July the Library of Congress began providing FREE
"trial" public access to the LC Authority File via the LC Authorities
site. For the cataloging community access to these files can serve many
purposes. Four files (Subject, Name, Title, and Name/Title Authority
Headings) are available for searching/browsing. 

A Few Details
According to the faq, "authority records cannot be searched by
keyword(s). are "left-anchored" -- search words must be entered in order
starting with the leftmost word (omitting initial articles and initial
punctuation)." Records are available in a labelled display and MARC
format. The only caveat, according to the faq, is that authority records
may only be saved, printed or emailed one at a time.

Reference Use?
Although in NO way are these files primary ready-reference tools but
they can assist in answering some "fast fact" questions. Here's one
example using the Names file. This file contains about 5.3 million
entries including data on 3.8 million personal, 900,000 corporate,
120,000 meeting, and 90,000 geographic names. After running a few
searches I found that you can learn "real names" and for birthdays for
authors, entertainers, and other celebrity types I was also able to
access some basic corporate name info. For example, info on company name
changes. Most entries include a citation to the source of the
information.

Sample Name File Searches To Try
Select Name Authority Headings and Enter Name
*Comedian Albert Brook's name file. You'll learn that his birth name is
Albert Einstein
*Rock Music legend Pete Townshend's Name File. Learn his full name,
birth date, and birth location. 
*Name file for Metra (the commuter railroad service in Chicago). Learn
that Metra is a service name for the Northeast Illinois Regional
Commuter Railroad Corporation. 
*The often used example, because of the many spelling variations, of
Muammar Qaddafi's authority record. 

Final Notes
For those of you out there who are not familiar with authority work,
here are several definitions from ODLIS to assist. You probably already
realize that these concepts have applications outside the traditional
library database as more and more organizations build databases where
control and uniformity of material in the database is necessary. The LC
Authority file is one of many authority files that exist. OCLC, other
libraries, and database providers all build and maintain their own
files. Btw, the LC Authorities file is Invisible Web data. These records
cannot be accessed from general web engines like Google and AltaVista.

I chose to offer both 1.1 and 2.0 interfaces for arXiv (both registered:
http://arXiv.org/oai1 and http://arXiv.org/oai2). I will take down the
1.1 interface when harvesters have migrated to 2.0. The objective is to
make it easy for service providers to harvest our metadata so this seems
to be the most helpful approach.

Cheers,
Simeon.


PS. out of curiosity I just counted accesses for last week:  v1.1: 442,
v2.0: 800 which I take as an encouraging sign that service providers are
switching to v2.0.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] New American Memory photograph collections OAI-ready
In-Reply-To: <003201c237da$34317590$8e2bd38d@lib.umich.edu>
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.21.0207301422310.8443-100000@sun8.loc.gov>

OAI-implementers,

Through our version 2.0 interface 
  [baseURL: http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/oai2_0]
records for two additional American Memory collections/sets of photographs
are now available for harvesting (in Dublin Core and MARC formats).

I am interested in firming up a transition plan from 1.1 to 2.0.  Are
there any harvesters (service providers) out there who see LC's American
Memory materials as an important component of their service who do not
expect to be harvesting using version 2 within 3 months (i.e. by the end
of October)?  I chose the 3 month deadline for withdrawing 1.1 service
arbitrarily and am certainly prepared to pick another date.  I'm just
hoping to have the planned date advertised with our list of available
collections at:
  http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/oamh/lcoa1_content.html

The two new collections include one that has been recently released (Ansel
Adams's Manzanar photos) and an American Memory favorite from the
project's beginnings (Panoramic Photographs).  More detail follows.

"Suffering Under a Great Injustice": Ansel Adams's Photographs of
Japanese-American Internment at Manzanar
  http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/aamhtml/aamhome.html

  Description: In 1943, Ansel Adams (1902-1984), America's best-known
photographer, documented the Manzanar War Relocation Center in California
and the Japanese Americans interned there during World War II. The
collection presents for the first time side-by-side digital scans of both
Adams's 242 original negatives and his 209 photographic prints, allowing
viewers to see his darkroom technique and in particular how he cropped his
prints. Adams's Manzanar work is a departure from his signature style of
landscape photography. Although a majority of the photographs are
portraits, the images also include views of daily life, agricultural
scenes, and sports and leisure activities.

Taking the Long View: Panoramic Photographs, 1851-1991 
  http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pnhtml/pnhome.html

  Description: The Panoramic Photograph Collection contains approximately
four thousand images featuring American cityscapes, landscapes, and group
portraits. They offer an overview of the nation, its enterprises and its
interests, with a focus on the start of the twentieth century when the
panoramic photo format was at the height of its popularity. Subject
strengths include: agricultural life; beauty contests; disasters;
engineering work such as bridges, canals and dams; fairs and expositions;
military and naval activities, especially during World War I; the oil
industry; schools and college campuses, sports, and transportation. The
images date from 1851 to 1991 and depict scenes in all fifty states and
the District of Columbia. More than twenty foreign countries and a few
U.S. territories are also represented. These panoramas average between
twenty-eight inches and six feet in length, with an average width of ten
inches.

  Enjoy harvesting and exploring these.
