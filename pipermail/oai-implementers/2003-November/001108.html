Hi all,

I need to amend this slightly.  Characters in the range x7F-x9F are legal in 
XML 1.0 and a compliant parser shouldn't complain about them (although I am 
pretty certain that some earlier XML parsers did complain about characters 
in this range).  In any case, you still need to be careful with these 
characters if you are converting from one of the Windows character sets.  A 
good description of the issue can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-controls.html.">http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-controls.html.</A>  Note that XML 
1.1 treats control characters somewhat differently than 1.0 in that it 
allows them but they can only be represented as Numeric Character References.

Regards,
	Tom
