Subject: [OAI-implementers] Putting news items on the OAI web site
Message-ID: <404A3A4758DDCC4C8A5C9A537384F9D6178D93@opus.cs.cornell.edu>

Dear all,

It is very satisfying to see an increasing number of OAI related
activities and meetings happening internationally.  Repeating an earlier
request, it would be wonderful if notices of upcoming meetings, reports
of meetings, new papers, and others newsworthy items were submitted for
posting on the OAI web site.  I remind you to use the "post to the OAI
web site" feature at http://www.openarchives.org.

Thanks,

Carl

Apologies for duplication.  Because of a hardware failure yesterday
(hard disk crash) these mail lists were out of service.  You should have
no problems with submissions now.

Hi Jeff,

I am bouncing your question back to the implementers list where there
are plenty of people with experience to answer your question.

Subject: Resumption tokens


Hello,

I currently run a small data provider (the Comparative Bantu Online
Dictionary) which contains less than a hundred metadata records.
However,
I may soon add about 2000 more records to our metadata inventory. I
haven't worried about resumption tokens to this point. I am wondering
if there are any guidelines on when to implement the use of resumption
tokens--I'm not concerned for the server on my end, but didn't know if I
should be worried about the harvesters.

Thanks,
Jeff Good

From a general point of view, it would be a "Good Idea" to implement flow
control (resumptionTokens), especially nearer the beginning of a project
while the way your system and OAI works is fresh in your memory!

Ignoring the initial harvest, the majority of harvesting will be based on
changes since two days ago. If you are likely to have a large number of
changes over two days (say, would create a larger than 1mb download),  as a
harvester I would like that broken up.

(In my limited experience XML and the tools to handle it don't scale well)

All the best,
Tim Brody
