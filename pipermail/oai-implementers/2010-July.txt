Subject: [OAI-implementers] Autentication in OAI-PMH
Message-ID: <AANLkTim95HmQiiDLrOzyBwCwOjCpTJV5dqud4bTF9jDT@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OAI Implementers,

I need your advice!

We're using OAI-PMH on a project, to make our records available to
third parties, but a new use-case has come up, and I'm starting to
think maybe OAI-PMH is not the best tool for the job. Please tell me
what you think:

The overall idea is that not all harvesters are to be considered
equal. By default harvesters should have access to a specific subset
of the data, that is public to everyone. But some harvesters should be
able to harvest a wider range of data, including both "public" and
"private" records. These "private" records are records that are still
being worked upon, or they have sensible institutional information
that is not to be made available to the "world". This suggests that
we'd need to provide an authentication mechanism of some sort, and
filter records according to each user. However, I'm not finding any
reference on the specs to Authentication.

Any help appreciated. Do you think OAI-PMH is applicable in this scenario?


Cheers!

Hi Filipe!
Please be aware that the "O" in "OAI" really intends to mean "Open"! In that
sense you are raising a relevant requirement for your project, but in fact it
intentionally never was a requirement for the OAI community...

Anyway, there are many "strategies" you can apply to still keep using the
basic OAI-PMH principles and on the same time apply your requirement... You
can start by using a VPN, but maybe other very simple one, that just came now
to my mind, would be to have from the server side an implementation of the
delivery of the data sets dependent from the IP address of the client (I mean,
you just need to customize a server for that, so for unknown IPs the server
gives the "public" data, and the "private" data only to known and previously
registered IPs...). Just an idea...

Regards
Jos? Borbinha

Well, I was afraid of that... :-)

That's definitely an option to consider, I'm going to look into it
more thoroughly. I'm concerned about what happens when institutional
networks are involved. For example, if behind a given IP address
there's an whole network of computers, by authorizing that IP address
we may be granting access to more harvesters (or individuals) than
intended.

I've just thought of a possible alternative, and would love to know
your thoughts about it:
Harvesting an OAI-PMH provider is made entirely through HTTP calls, so
maybe one could use HTTP's basic-authentication? Even if the OAI-PMH
protocol doesn't say that servers should challenge harvesters for
authentication, if a harvester does provide authentication information
(more specifically, if it provides HTTP basic-auth credentials, sent
on the HTTP headers), the harvester could act accordingly. This way,
the OAI-PMH provider would remain compatible with "normal" harvesters,
to which it would provide only the "public" records. But it would be
able to provide additional records to harvesters providing
credentials.

Do you see any reason why this could not work? Please warn me if you
think it's a bad practice for some reason :-)

Filipe,

OAI-PMH uses HTTP as a transport layer and isn't fussy about what happens under the HTTP covers. If you use proper HTTP status codes (e.g. 401/403) and headers (e.g. "WWW-Authenticate") to manage the authentication, there doesn't seem to be any wording in the OAI-PMH standard that would be problematic.

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#HTTPResponseFormat

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.2
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.4
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-11

Solving this according to Web standard authentication procedures be praiseworthy. 

I wouldn't worry about ideology of the protocol being "Open". It's just a protocol.

Jeff

just to echo Jeff's comment: solve your auth problems with http.

Although I can't recall any examples, it is my understanding that there 
are many instances of harvesters & repos currently doing this.

Michael
