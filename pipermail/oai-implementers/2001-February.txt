Subject: [OAI-implementers] updates on repository explorer
Message-ID: <3A7EE3EB.42ACD5C@vt.edu>

hi

i just made some changes to the repository explorer that may interest
some of you ...

1. i changed the auto-tester to now count as protocol errors only
missing parameters and illegal verbs ... everything else should generate
either a 400 or verifiable XML

2. i put in support for 503 in both the auto-tester and the explorer ...
this support is transparent so there will be a delay but no errors will
be generated (thanx to Simeon for the comments on this issue)

thanx for all the feedback ... if you encounter any problems, please let
me know and i will look into it asap ...

Subject: [OAI-implementers] List Id's for multiple sets
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10102081523160.19888-100000@duncan.cs.utk.edu>

Now that we're adding more sets, I'm suddenly unclear about the usage of
ListIdentifiers and ListRecords, where the set specification is optional.

When no set is specified, should I list ids/records from first one set,
then another, then another, till I run out of sets?  
 (alphabetical order?)

Using resumption tokens, should I keep track of which sets I've covered so
far, and pick up where I left off, so that all sets are covered, when no
set is specified?

  This is looking more complicated than I expected.  With no dates
specified, and no sets specified, the list could be enormous;  and as more
and more sets are added, the resumption tokens could get pretty hairy too.

  Question to those who have implemented this for multiple sets:  is this
how you have done it, or do you have a better way?

The only meaning is that you should list the complete contents of
the repository -- regardless of whether items belong to none, one
or more sets.

The order in which you return ids/records is not specified by
the protocol. You may choose any convenient order.

This is entirely implementation dependent. The protocol spec. explicitly
says that the resumptionToken is opaque. I suggest you do whatever
makes the implementation simplest.

We haven't touched on issues of how large the resumptionToken might
get. I think one should try to avoid them getting too huge.

I _choose_ to encode the equivalent parameters for a request to continue
the list. This is possible because I _choose_ to return ids/records in
date order with 1 day granularity.

Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE98341F06@OA3-SERVER.oa.oclc.org>

I'd like to announce the availability of a thesis and dissertation OAI 1.0
repository with the base URL of
http://purl.org/alcme/etdcat/servlet/OAIHandler. It passed the Repository
Explorer 1.0 examination and has been added to its list of tested archives.
The repository currently contains a sample of about 100,000 thesis and
dissertation records extracted from OCLC's WorldCat database. Documentation
for the repository, such as it is, can be found at
http://purl.org/alcme/etdcat/index.html.

Currently, the repository only supports the oai_dc format. Eventually, it
will also support an enhanced Dublin Core format to be defined by the
Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations organization (NDLTD).

I'd also like to note that this repository was built using OAICat software
that will eventually be available to the OAI community under an open-source
license. The idea for this software is to make it as simple as possible for
people to add OAI protocol capability to an existing database.
Documentation, as it accumulates, can be found at
http://alcme.oclc.org:4342/OAICat.html. If this sounds useful to you,
contact me for details.

Excuse my ignorance if this is already obvious to you:

(as suggested by Chris Gutteridge, this is how I have implemented
resumptionTokens)

Initial request:
Build a temporary table of all the identifiers that match the request,
this CAN get huge but if you want harvesters to get all of your repository
there isn't much choice...(indeed I would argue this is more efficient
than enumerating over sets)
Output the first 400 records (or whatever) from the temporary table, using
the identifiers as an index into your database/file system. The
resumptionToken will be the name of your temporary table and an encoded
string to tell you what the metadataFormat is (required for ListRecords).

Temporary table is:
pos	int,auto_increment
id	char(64) ... this is OAI Identifier/your archive identifier, but
if you use OAI to index means ListIdentifiers only needs temporary table

Latter requests:
Get the appropriate list of identifiers by saying get "pos > start".

To manage the temporary tables I have another table, the temp index, which
stores the table names and the last time they were accessed. Whenever a
query is started I remove old temporary tables and their associated
entries in the temp index. To make the resumptionToken even simpler you
could store the metadataPrefix in the index ...

The initial request can be very slow, as it has to enumerate over your
entire archive, but subsequent requests are very quick. Each harvester (if
it is well behaved) will only need to do this once, subsequent queries
should use "from" to only grab the latest data.

e.g. (liable to be broken and knackered as is my wont)
http://cite-base.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi-bin/oai/OAI-script?debug=1&verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

As an aside, I have tried to write my OAI "bits" to be in a seperate, non
archive-specific library - would people be interested in access to this (I
can not guarantee its correctness nor robustness, just it supports the
bits of OAI that I've needed)?

Good gracious, Tim!  That *is* complex.  What happens if you have 40
harvesters working on your program at once?  You would have multiple
tables--- are you using cookies?  And do you have time limitations on
accessing those temp tables?  If so, how do you implement that--- and do
you remove all current temp tables on each new query?  Seems like that
would mess up with several current accessess.  But unaccessed tables could
build up also, so I certainly see that they would need to be periodically
cleared out.  

  Whew!  

   And yes, I for one would like to see your OAI "bits";  I'd love to
compare how I'm doing things with how others are, to see if I can improve
on my methods.

I have found temporary tables make life simpler ... or at least as easy as
implementing encoding and decoding of resumptionToken strings.

A more detailed explanation of what I'm doing:

The resumptionToken I'm generating is a "session token", that is it is
unique to the query that generated it (and is not supposed to be harvester
understandable).
For each token I generate I create a table with the same name, see tmpXXX
below. ( FYI I'm using token = offset+remote_addr+time+rand()+metadataPrefix )

The resumptionToken has a limited life-span, currently I've got it set to
30 minutes. Each time the resumptionToken is used I refresh its
timestamp, so if a query takes longer than 30 minutes (with multiple
resumptions) it will not timeout.

Each time a query is made I clear tables older than 30 minutes. BTW The
time to live (TTL) of tokens is unspecified by OAI (an error 400 should be
returned if you have discarded the token - not yet implemented by me).

My tables:
tmpIndex
========
	tableName = The unique name of the table
	timestamp = The last time this table was accessed

tmpXXX
======
	pos = The index of the identifier, used for finding the offset
		to resume from
	identifier = The OAI identifier

I have purposely not copied the metadata into the temporary table to avoid
getting "explosive" growth in database size, besides it makes finding the
offset faster and the operation to find the metadata given an identifier
is O(1).

Chris has suggested some improvements to this scheme:
- Store the request parameters in the tmpIndex, therefore if two (or 40)
harvesters simultaneously request the same data you need not run the same
search more than once
- Store the metadataPrefix in tmpIndex, therefore avoiding the need to
encode this parameter (the resumption offset still needs to be encoded)

As a last thought about timeouts:
What do you do if a harvester requests, gets a resumptionToken, then uses
that token a week later? My instinct would be, if the token is still
alive, it should complete the list as it existed a week ago rather than
putting in any alterations. But ... I can't see anything in the OAI
protocol that makes it explicit about whether alterations to data should
be reflected during flow control (?).

Thank you. I am coding in PERL modules - I will make an effort to get it
all together in a web page - I fear they will not be as accomplished as
Jeff Young's servlets!

All the best,

From: ePrints Support (Christopher Gutteridge) <support@eprints.org>
Subject: Multiple language Support for Eprints.

eprints.org is beginning to gain some multi-language functionality.

I plan to have "language" files with all the phrases used by eprints in
them. I will maintain an English version, and arrange to make it as
easy as possible to create/maintain other languages - hopefully a
script to compare any language file with the english file and spot any
missing phrases etc.

It's time-consuming applying this change, but also easy. It will take a
while to get the whole code done.

The advantage of this method is that although each eprint.org archive
will have a default language, a user could view the CGI scripts in any
language supported, using cookies or something!

I'm currently considering how to make the static pages support multiple
languages... I'm considering mod_rewrite using the same cookie. I think
static pages are a slightly different issue from the main code, as
people will want to customise those, and customising in more than one
language will be more than most people, especially anglocentric ones,
will want to do.

The other issue is the "help" in the metadata cfg section and various
blocks of english text in the site routines.=20

Some of SiteInfo.pm may go from:

$EPrintsSite::SiteInfo::blurb =3D "This is some blurb only in english";

to

$EPrintsSite::SiteInfo::blurb{english} =3D "This is some blurb only in engl=
ish";

With the option to add any language you support; how does this sound?

My main concern is not making any significant extra work to deploy
eprints.org for people who DON'T care about this issue.

Please see the attached file for an example of a language file - this
is only somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 of the final length I'm
expecting.

I'd be keen for some of you to at least have a go at translating some
of this so I've got some french (and other language) text to work with
(I'm afraid I am a monoglot). Also let me know if there is anything
good/bad about the way that I've organised it.

The file is organised by the file which uses the phrase. Eg. User.pm
Each line has a ID for the phrase eg:

H:thanks =3D Thank-you. Your paper named $(1) is now in the system.

"H" indicates that this will be displayed as HTML so &aacute; etc are
acceptable. Other types, "M" for example, will need different escaping
of such characters, or they may be altogether illegal.

Rather than split a sentence into two phrases, the system inserts data
into the points at $(1) $(2) etc...

Is there a plan for registering archive identifiers yet? I'd like
to mention it in the eprints.org documentation.

Does anyone know of a system for assigning unqique identifiers to 
other cromulent entities such as people (creators), institutions
and/or anything else you might want to uniquely identify in an
archives metadata.

At least journals and books have ISSN and ISBN.

  In the RePEc project, we have extensive collections of such
  data and all of them have persistent identifiers. However the
  solution that we adopt are local to RePEc. But it works well
  in user services.

  In addition, Simeon and I are working on an academic metadata
  format. This will not by itself solve the identification problem,
  (it can not, really)  but it will allow you to use identified authors
  and institution in a straightforwared way in your metadata set.
  You are welcome to join our small team and work on this. We should
  have a test version out soon.

  Finally, and most importantly,  there is the OAI meeting on
  certification in Geneva.  I expect that such registration aspects
  will be discussed there.

  Cheers,

The answer to your question about unique identifiers for non-bibliographic
items isn't necessarily simple. 

If there is a simple answer, this is it. The Library of Congress has a MARC
name authority database for people and institutions, and each records has a
widely recognized unique identifier called the LCCN. The coverage, however,
is hardly exhaustive. For details about the format, consult
http://lcweb.loc.gov/marc/authority/.

Closer to home, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations
(NDLTD) project (see http://www.ndltd.org/), may be of interest to you since
it's dealing with this very issue. NDLTD is working to create OAI
repositories around the world containing thesis and dissertation records
from participating universities and libraries. OCLC has been assigned the
task of developing a scheme for allowing links to be stored in the records
in place of personal names. (I'm oversimplifying a little here.) For
example, where you might otherwise see <dc:creator>Twain, Mark</dc:creator>,
I expect that you will instead see some sort of URL that will return a rich
set of XML data about that person. In an important sense, then, this URL is
a unique identifier for the person, and a useful one to boot.

I should note, however, that NDLTD has chosen to accomplish this feat by
defining their own metadata format based on the Resource Description
Framework (RDF). Since OAI hasn't chosen to use RDF to encode their oai_dc
format, such linking isn't appropriate from their default format. If you
plan to store any kind of link in your records, you too will be forced to
define your own format just as NDLTD will do.

To continue, and this is all still preliminary thinking, the URL I just
mentioned might very well resolve to an OAI GetRecord command to an OAI
repository containing name authority records. The implications of using the
OAI protocols are that the authority database could be distributed around
the world and freely shared. To show the potential, the LC authority
database I mentioned above could easily be mounted as an OAI repository and
the MARC content distributed in XML format for convenient use. One caveat
here, though is that there is currently no Dublin Core standard for name
authority information. The NDLTD application, however, depends on such a
scheme, so it will happen, even if it's ad hoc.

An even bigger caveat, however, is that this is just the tip of the
logistical iceberg for making such a scheme work. I've worked on authority
control-related projects for a number of years here at OCLC, and can attest
to the fact that it's a horribly complicated problem. The internet and tools
such as OAI, XML, Dublin Core, and perhaps even PURLs afford us an
opportunity to reexamine the way we can address this problem. I'm pretty
excited about the possibilities.

Herbert:

While the current OAI spec is clearly workable for the time being using
techniques such as what you and Carl suggest, we do think that it would be
desirable in a future revision to allow for references to multiple
namespaces and XSDs per metadataPrefix in a response ListMetadataFormats.  

For instance, the response to XML Schemas Last Call item 12
(http://www.w3.org/2000/05/12-xmlschema-lcissues.html#exporting-attributes)
talks about the desirability of writing schemas to allow later extensions
unknown to the original schema using other techniques than import statements
within an XSD. (See specifically Dan Connolly's comment: "I think it's
clearly preferable to have one schema for XHTML, one for SMIL, one for SVG,
and one for MathML that can be used together in compound documents; rather
than one for XHTML+MathML, one for XHTML+MathML+SVG, etc. for a total of N!
schemas.") 

In the meantime we can build for use with OAI brief XSDs that import and
merge other canonical metadata XSDs as necessary.

A crosswalk from MARC to Dublin Core is now available from the MARC 21 Web
site.  This document marks MARC 21 fields to Dublin Core elements; there
are separate sections for unqualified and qualified Dublin Core. It is at:
http://www.loc.gov/marc/marc2dc.html


The alternate mapping, Dublin Core to MARC, is undergoing revision and
will be made available soon.

The crosswalk (unqualified Dublin Core) is generally used by the Library
of Congress in its OAI implementation with a few modifications.

Christopher,

We are in the final stages of putting up the registration mechanism.
Take a look at
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/lagoze/Projects/OAi/registration.htm for a
draft of the page that (hopefully) explains everything.  Note that the
form does not work yet.  We hope to have this completed by the end of
Monday.

We are working on this.  Carl will send a reply very soon.

>From a recent conversation, I understand that The International DOI
Foundation thinks that assigning identifiers to "parties" (in addition
to "creations") should be part of their long term strategy.  I also
learnt that the IDF and CNRI are looking into collaborating with an EC
project named InterParty that works on the notion of a "Directory of
Parties".  CNRI's expertise with handle technology could obviously be
very valuable with this respect.  

In the OpenURL linking framework we equally need such identifiers for
parties.  This was one of the initial findings of my SFX research.  I
have recently been in touch with CNRI regarding assigning handles to
parties in the context of an ongoing experiment re the alternative
resolution of DOI's using the OpenURL framework

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Special characters, UNICODE, and OAI tools
In-Reply-To: <Pine.SOL.4.21.0102101607400.8534-100000@sun8.loc.gov>
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.21.0102121814410.27356-100000@sun8.loc.gov>

I am exploring what is happening to special characters through a
variety of browsers, Hussein's Repository Explorer, and ARC.  This is in
part to have a reliable way to check the results of our mapping and in
part to be able to explain to others why things look odd when they try
them.

Hussein, 

Can you confirm that you are doing nothing to the UNICODE entities in your
Raw XML view?  That's what it looks like if I look at the page source.  

My Netscape 4.7 for Windows (under Windows 95) appears to replace the &#
by ? before displaying the entity.  My Mac version of Netscape appears to
handle some of the entities (i and a with acute accents, for example) but
not others.  Internet Explorer 5.5 for Windows is handling all the
characters I have looked at so far.  [This looks like the best approach
for checking mapping of known characters.]

What do you do in the parsed view?  I'm getting strange character
combinations in both Netscape 4.7 and Internet Explorer 5.5.

Liu,    

Several (although not all) special characters are coming through when I
use ARC with Netscape 4.7 on Windows.  Internet 5.5 doesn't do any better
than Netscape 4.7.  Also, not coming through are a few "XML sanity"
entities, which we have been expressing as "old-fashioned" character
entities.  I don't claim to be an XML character encoding expert; for OAI
we accepted the recommendation of our standards office to keep using this
handful of character entities (e.g. &apos;) in that form.  What do others
think the practice should be on these?  They presumably validate against
the schema because they get through Hussein's Explorer.

Sample GetRecord URLs that show the issues are:

http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/oai1_0?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai:lcoa1:loc.music/musdi.213

  Title includes apostrophe in     d'une

and 

http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/oai1_0?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai:lcoa1:loc.music/musdi.215

  4 special czech characters (regular letters with diacritics)


   Any thoughts and experiences welcome.

yes. the only substitution i was making for a raw view was escaping of
the angle brackets ... but i just changed that to escape ampersands as
well ... so now your output should be "rawer" ...

thats the tricky thing ... all my character processing is done in 8-bit
so the XML parser mangles >8bit stuff before passing it on to other
tests ... (i use expat for XML parsing and xsv for xsd processing) ...

there are two things i could do here: either change everything to
16-bit, which could involve considerable effort ... or just ignore the
problem since it doesnt really signify an error: its just that the
"best-effort" to display characters is failing ... you should never
actually get an error message unless you use entities in your parameters
(identifiers, sets, etc.)

in either event, i will keep this issue in mind and try to remedy it
when i crank out the next revision ...

Thanks for the message. It's **partially** solved now. For the part 
solved, it's a bug in program. For the part I did not solve, I need more
test.

Solved part:

The "Entity Reference" is widely used in loc archive, as DOM level 1
specified in
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-1-20000929/level-one-core.html#ID-11C98490
, an "Entity Reference" may or may **not** be expanded into Unicode
during parsing, Unfortunately, the parser I am using (java xml parser from
sun), does the expanding randomly, I did not notice this problem before
and treated all as expanding. So the sample URL 1 is working fine after
the bug-fix.

no solved:
In sample2, some expanded "Entity Reference"s are not correctly processed.
I have to do more test.

regards,
liu

  If we implement another metadata prefix, do we then return data in the
given format (which need not include Dublin core *or* XML) in response to
GetRecord & ListRecords, if that format is specified?
  (and the others are still returned in xml/dc, since the MDprefix is not
an input arg for them?)

  I am guessing in that case we create our own
schema which determines if what we are returning is correct.

 
Am I clear on this?? If not, please enlighten me!  thanks!

We've put up a new page at the OAI site that gives details on
registering as a data provider.  You can look at it at

We will update the eprints.org information about sta/service provision
to reflect this. But will there be a site that lists the registered
data-providers and service-providers? (Right now the eprints.org links
to this are out of date, as the old registries are superseded. Can we
have new URLs for these two lists?)

Second, are the current compliant data-providers (e.g. CogPrints)
being carried over into this new registry, or do they have to go
through the registration again?

Hi Stevan,

Answers to your questions:

1. We have no plans at the moment for registration of service providers.
Our main goal with registration at this point is to register only those
data providers that are conformant with the protocol as described in
http://www.openarchives.org/registration.htm.  'Conformance' for service
providers is difficult to define, and we are still considering what it
means to register them. 
2. As stated at the top of http://www.openarchives.org/registration.htm,
our intention is to "provide a publicaly accessible list of OAI
conformant repositories" (data providers).  Donna Bergmark has that on
her list as soon as the registration software and conformance testing
software is completed.
3. I tried to go to eprints.org to check out the 'links' that you are
referring to but the site is down at the moment.
4. By "go through registration again", I'm assuming you mean the need
for sites that were listed as "Santa Fe registered" having to registered
as "OAI data providers".  Since these are indeed to different animals -
the protocol is completely different - we do ask that anyone who
supported Santa Fe and has now changed to the OAI protocol please go
through the registration process. Since this involves but a handful of
sites, we hope that this won't be too much of a problem.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,

Carl

Please let us know the URL for the registry as soon as it is
established. In fact, I would suggest setting up now, out of the old
set of data-providers, specifying that these are not yet OAI 1.0-tested,
but shortly will be, and once shown to comply, will be upgraded to
registered status.

(I don't think it's as motivating to register if we cannot also point
to a registry.)

I don't think it's down (just tried it). 

The code I've just ask Chris to change is in http://www.eprints.org/

Please change:

As you see, I still point to the old service-provider registry because
I think it is an important target to keep in mind. Any suggestions for
alternatives would be welcome!

Ok. I believe Chris Gutteridge is doing this right now. Again, it would
be a motivator to transfer the prior registry into a new registry as
something like "pending upgrade" so the registry is there, and
non-empty. It is then a traget to aim toward for others.

CogPrints is intended as a repository for the self-archiving, by their
authors (or, by authorized second parties, or, if the papers are in the
public domain, by anyone), of research papers in the cognitive sciences
(Psychology, Neuroscience, and pertinent portions of Biology, Computer
Science, Linguistics, Philosophy and other pertinent disciplines).
Papers can be (1) refereed, accepted, published final drafts
("postprints") or (2) unrefereed drafts prior to publication
("preprints"). Deposits will be vetted by CogPrints for relevance only;
they will not be otherwise validated or authenticated. Responsibility
for the validity and authenticity of the content of these self-archived
papers rests entirely with the depositor. Any copyright violations are
also entirely the responsibility of the depositor. (CogPrints, if it
receives proof of copyright violation, will immediately remove the
paper in question.)

I hear your point and its a matter of philosophy.  Our goal in the
registry and in the conformance testing is to provide a relatively high
integrity list of data providers (where integrity is measured by our
stated test criteria).  The list of old data providers while
historically interesting doesn't provide any information that anyone can
use - e.g., Santa Fe conformance has really very little to do with OAI
1.0 conformance.  Being a minimalist at heart I'd rather stick to
posting information that is useful for applications.

Good point!  I'll touch base with Donna today to see how long it can be
before a listing capability will be possible.

I still can't get to it.  You might have a sys admin do some checks.  I
did a traceroute and I get as far as southampton.site.ja.net
(146.97.255.0), but then it can't find www.eprints.org.

I have no objections or opinions on individual sites pointing to their
service providers of choice. Hopefully there will be an increasing
number of service providers tailored for individual community needs.
So, go ahead and point to those that you think are appropriate for you.

The registry is not empty and has a few conformant repositories in it.
We just need to get the listing capability up.

I'm personally comfortable about stating anything is "pending" without
having such promise from the party responsible for the site.  Too many
chances of unrequited promises. I'd rather stick with only listing those
things that are actual.

Carl

~47,000 metadata records for sheet music digitized for American Memory are
now available for harvesting from lcoa1 as a new set (in Dublin Core and
oai-marc formats).

  BaseURL  http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/oai1_0 

Over 47,000 pieces of sheet music registered for copyright during the
years 1870 to 1885. Included are popular songs, piano music, sacred and
secular choral music, solo instrumental music, method books and
instructional materials, and music for band and orchestra.  The
corresponding American Memory collection is 

  Music for the Nation: American Sheet Music, 1870-1885 
  http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/smhtml/smhome.html

This is the third Set available.  The others are American Memory's 
digitized maps (~3000) and a collection of dance manuals (~200).

We have implemented the ResumptionToken feature (using the same
temporary session file approach used for American Memory).  As currently
configured, ListIdentifiers returns batches of 5,000 and ListRecords
batches of 500.

hi

i have a quick question ...

since you added a new set to an existing interface, how do you make sure
that everything gets harvested by service providers who already have you
listed as a source (and dont use sets) ? are all new records stamped
with the current date ? or is there another solution to this ?

and while im on this topic, yesterday i was discussing changing a
database->metadata mapping on one of our OAs ... how would i force all
service providers to reload our data ? datestamps ? deletion and
recoding of ids ? will internal versioning of ids make this simpler ?

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAICat software is available.
Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE98341F32@OA3-SERVER.oa.oclc.org>

A week ago, or so, I mentioned that I was working on some open-source
software (OAICat) that would allow people to add OAI support to their own
databases. I have it cleaned up pretty well now, and packaged it up so
people can starting trying it out. Project information can be found at
http://alcme.oclc.org:4342/oaicat/. Installation notes can be found at
http://alcme.oclc.org:4342/oaicat/install.html. 

OAICat is a Java Servlet 2.2 "web application" that runs in a compliant
server such as Apache's Tomcat Server (http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/).
Once Tomcat is installed, you just copy the OAICat web application
(available at http://alcme.oclc.org:4342/oaicat/oaicat.war) into Tomcat's
webapps subdirectory and start the server. Tomcat runs on port 8080 by
default, so once the server is started, you should be able to access a
working demo from a URL such as http://my.org:8080/oaicat where "my.org" is
replaced with your machine's domain name.

When you start the server, the oaicat.war file will unpack itself
automatically. Once it's unpacked, you'll find the source code in the
webapps/oaicat/WEB-INF/classes subdirectory. Soon, this source will be
available via CVS, at which time people can join me in developing the core
code base. For the time being, I've included the source for comment's sake.

The install notes at the URL I mentioned above has a brief section with the
steps necessary to get OAICat to work with your own database. Basically,
you'll need to write a new class implementing the
ORG.oclc.oai.catalog.OAICatalog interface using your own database's API
calls. You can pattern it after ORG.oclc.oai.catalog.DummyOAICatalog, which
is used for the demo. The only other step should be to change the
webapps/oaicat/WEB-INF/oaicat.properties file to point to your new class and
specify any properties necessary to get it initialized. Use the
DummyOAICatalog properties you'll find there as a guide.

Note that OCLC is currently working on the release of an open-source
database engine called Gwen/Pears. I'm currently using this database engine
for the Theses and Dissertations repository at
http://purl.org/alcme/etdcat/. Hopefully, it will be available soon so other
people can use it for their own repositories.

Right now, my notes on all this are rather sparse. Please contact me if you
have questions about OAICat that the documentation doesn't cover. I'd like
to make OAICat as painless as possible to use, so comments and criticisms
are welcome.

Jody,

If I understand your question correctly...

- Each record only contains metadata in one format.
- The format corresponds to the prefix given as an argument.
- A prefix argument is alway required regardless of whether the desired
return is DC or another metadata format.
- Every metadata format requires a schema for validation.

Actually, we have data available in TEI lite (a build on SGML), from
which we extracted the info to create the dc XML files.  And soon we
will have streaming media, etc., etc;  and also we have incredible 
images of old documents, stuff like that.
   Looking at the specs, it seems that the return info on the verbs
which require metadata prefixes could be/should be in the format of
whatever the prefix describes (via the created schema).
  However, Hussein tells me (thank-you, Hussein!!) that I am
constrained to put everything in XML regardless of what it is.  I can
probably figure out a way to do that with TEI lite (though it may
render it pointless), but I can't exactly put streaming media in XML---
only a description of it.  So now it seems to me that if we want to make 
that stuff available, it can only be via a link, either in the metadata
somewhere, or via the <about> tag in ListRecords (or both).

  Is my understanding on this clear??
  I appreciate your feedback!

Okay, okay, I realize now how dumb that sounds.  Of course we are only
returning metadata about records;  by extension it seems silly to want
to return that in video, audio, or images;  but when dealing with other
text formats, it's not nearly so clear.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0102211535370.5052-100000@sway.ecs.soton.ac.uk>

Hi all,

I have written a few PERL modules that should make the implementation of
OAI compliant archives and harvesters a bit easier, taking care of most of
the OAI protocol.

Initial documentation is available from:
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~tdb198/oai/frontend.html

The modules can be downloaded by following the "availability" section.

Please keep in mind that these modules are in development.

I invite comments/criticisms/bug reports.

If you would like to make use of these modules during this development
stage please contact me beforehand so I can keep track of where they are
being used.

I also hope to make my code for a complete harvester/search engine
available when it is a bit more complete!

All the best,

Hi all,

Here is another sample implementation of the OAI protocol for anyone who
might be using a Windows NT platform.  You can download the ZIP file from
the following URL:

http://dli.grainger.uiuc.edu/publications/twcole/oaialpha/

This is a simple implementation, intended for illustration only, using the
Microsoft Windows Active Server Pages (ASP) and ActiveX Data Object (ADODB)
technology.  A sample MS Access database is included, but the scripts could
be easily modified to support other data sources such as SQL Server or
others.

See the included README file for minimalist documentation.

Anyone is free to use this however they see fit; all the usual caveats
apply, of course.

Any and all questions, comments, or bug reports are welcome.

Kind regards,

archives at this time, how they use them if they do, why they do not
use them if they do not, and what features they would like to have
added to them to make them more useful. (The survey is anonymous.
Revealing your identity is optional and it will be kept confidential.)

The survey consists of about 72 web-based questions, and comes in four
versions:

PHYSICISTS, ASTROPHYSICISTS, MATHEMATICIANS

    1. arXiv Users

    2. arXiv Non-Users

COGNITIVE SCIENTISTS (Psychologists, Neuroscientists, Behavioral
Biologists, Computer Scientists [AI/robotics/vision/speech/learning],
Linguists, Philosophers)

    3. CogPrints Users

    4. CogPrints Non-Users

OTHER DISCIPLINES: Please use either 2. or 4.

Patricia,

You're right - this should probably be covered in a FAQ or something.

Putting on my NASA hat, I can say what we get out of OAI participation.

I'm responsible for:

http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/
and 
http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/

though I'm less involved with the latter now.  The goal of these DLs it to
have maximum exposure for their contents.   I'd say their respective
interfaces are functional, but surely others could do a better job.  My
focus is mainly on making as much LaRC / NACA content as possible is
available on line.  To that end, both of the above have OAI interfaces:

http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/oai/
http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/oai/

So others can harvest our metadata and include them in their own service
provder (which points back to the "data" (full text reports in this case)
at our DLs).

Ultimately, OAI harvesting is the "right" way to build services such as:

http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/NTRS
(which I'm resposible for) and:

http://www.osti.gov/bridge/
http://www.osti.gov/preprint/
http://stinet.dtic.mil/

and other services.  And if you don't like those interfaces, you can build
your own service provider, and it can target the OAI archives of your
choosing.  An example of an OAI compliant service provider is:

http://arc.cs.odu.edu/

Which does some neat things with using Oracle and session mgmt for quick
searching.  Not satisfied?  Build your own service provider and use a
different search engine (or a totally different resource discovery
metaphor, if you'd like).

It would be nice to have an OAI interface to:

http://www.inform.bnl.gov/pubsearch/

so the contents therein could be discovered through alternate
interfaces.  I'm guessing the only current way to find:

http://www.pubs.bnl.gov/pubs/documents/21099.pdf

is through through http://www.inform.bnl.gov/pubsearch/ ....

it would be nice if people searching http://arc.cs.odu.edu could find it,
or perhaps people searching a DOE-specific service provider (OSTI?), or
perhaps a through a service provider run by the Sierra Club (for example),
which selectively harvested this report (and related reports) for their
constituency interested in the environmental planning of government
research laboratories.

In summary, the advantages of participating as a data provider are mostly
about increased visibility of your contents.  You can use the OAI protocol
to easily build things like selective dissemination of information,
alerts, update services, etc., but these projects seem to me to be related
to the "increased visibility" result.

If BNL wanted to construct a serivce provider, it could easily harvest
from other sources to build (for example) a specialized service directly
targeted for your customer base.  Or you could decide you can do a better
job ofa general service provider than OSTI and build your own ;-)

Let me know if you have any questions.

regards,

Michael
