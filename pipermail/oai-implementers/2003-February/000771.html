<PRE>I agree that encoding problems should be corrected by the data provider. I
have spent a considerable amount of time sending bug reports to data
providers in the past (I haven't been doing this recently because I
haven't been doing broad harvests).

My point on the oai-general list was really that we shouldn't get hung-up
on the notion of &quot;compliance&quot;. The notion isn't well defined or policed
and many server implementations have occasional problems (even mine...
shock, horror!). The key is that initiatives such as eprints.org an dspace
have built-in support for metadata sharing using OAI (notwithstanding the
occasional bug) and that is very good for the open access movement and OAI
service providers.

Cheers,
Simeon.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; i think Tim poses a very relevant question: do we deal with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; so-called &quot;real-world&quot; encoding problems or do we try to encourage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; people to fix their implementations? (of course, for research  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; purposes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; we may end up doing both :))
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; personally, the code i distribute to others does quite a lot of XML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; cleaning in the data provider, but none at all in the harvester. i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; think the basic philosophy i'm following is: clean data as close to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the source as possible. also, i believe one of the reasons the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; adminEmail field in Identify responses is required is so that a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; service provider can contact the administrator if there are problems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with the data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and now that the hype about OAI2 is dying down, i wonder how much (if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; any) more testing we need. i have some ideas to enhance, complement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and possibly even replace the repository explorer in the next year
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... it all depends on finding time and/or students/colleagues with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; time :)
