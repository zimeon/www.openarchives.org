<PRE>LC has recently added several new sets (collections) of records for
harvesting.  For the first time, digitized materials beyond those
available through American Memory are being made available.  The new
materials are three relatively small collections of digitized photographs
from the Prints &amp; Photographs Division.  More pictorial materials will be
following soon, including some posters and drawings.  All the sets have
set-level descriptive metadata (Dublin Core) in the setDescriptions.

New sets (all also included in the lcphotos set) are:

Glass negatives from the Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright
  Orville and Wilbur Wright, pioneers in early aviation, used photography
to document their experiments with flight and to record family events.

Fenton Crimean War Photographs
  Mainly portrait photographs of British, French, and Turkish
military personnel in the Crimea in 1855. Roger Fenton was a British
photographer.  See <A HREF="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/ftncnwhtml/ftncnwback.html">http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/ftncnwhtml/ftncnwback.html</A>

John C. H. Grabill Collection
  Grabill's remarkably well-crafted, sepia-toned images capture the forces
of western settlement in South Dakota and Wyoming and document its effects
on the area's indigenous communities.  See
<A HREF="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/grabillhtml/grabillback.html">http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/grabillhtml/grabillback.html</A>
  [Since this collection is included in LC's Russian collaboration,
   &quot;Meeting of Frontiers,&quot; there was already a description of the
   collection in Russian.  The setDescription includes dc:title and
   dc:description elements in both languages (distinguished by the
   xml:lang attribute).]

I am interested in hearing from anyone who is making use of the set
description records.
