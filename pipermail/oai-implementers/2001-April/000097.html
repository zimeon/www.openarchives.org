<PRE>Herbert,

I tried the new schemas and Xerces seems to be happy with them. Thanks!

Jeff

hi Jeff,

Thanks for this.  Your consideration is correct, there is a problem in
the schema that use the &quot;status&quot; attribute.  That is GetRecord,
ListRecords and ListIdentifiers.

This is what the September 2000 schema specs say re specifying
occurencies of attributes.  In the excerpt that I include, reference is
made to the following declaration in an xsd file:

&lt;xsd:attribute name=&quot;country&quot; type=&quot;xsd:NMTOKEN&quot; use=&quot;fixed&quot;
value=&quot;US&quot;/&gt;

&quot;
Attributes may appear once or not at all (the default), and so the
syntax for specifying occurrences of attributes
is different than the syntax for elements. In particular, a use
attribute is used in an attribute declaration to
indicate whether the attribute is required or optional, and if optional
whether the attribute's value is fixed or
whether there is a default. A second attribute, value, provides any
value that is called for. To illustrate, po.xsd
contains a declaration for the country attribute, which is declared with
use and value values of fixed and US
respectively. This declaration means that the appearance of a country
attribute is optional, although its value
must be US if it does appear, and if it does not appear, a schema
processor will create a country attribute with
this value. 
&quot;

This last line indicates that Xerces is doing the right thing, which is
obviously not what we want to happen.

With Michael Nelson, I have revised the XML Schema that involved a
status attribute.  The solution was less straightforward than one would
hope.  There is no simple way to express what we really would like to
express: the status attribute may occur, and if it occurs its value must
be &quot;deleted&quot;.  The workaround is to list legitimate values of the status
attribute and specify a default.  We chose the values to be &quot;deleted&quot;
and &quot;not deleted&quot;, with &quot;not deleted&quot; as the default.  With this in
place, one can express in a schema that the status attribute may appear,
and that its default value (if the attribute does not appear) is &quot;not
deleted&quot;.  One can also express that there is only one other legitimate
value for status.  It is &quot;deleted&quot;.  And this one must be specified,
since it is not the default value.  


Using this approach nothing really changes for data providers (nor
service providers, really).  But I guess Xerces will do the right thing,
now, add the default value of &quot;not deleted&quot; to all records that do not
have the status attribute specified.

The way to express the above approach in the schema is different for the
Sep/Oct 2000 specs that we use and for the most recent XML specs.  but
that is another story, to be addressed later.  

I attach the edited xsd files.  I will put them in place, unless someone
disagrees with the approach taken.

many greetings

herbert
