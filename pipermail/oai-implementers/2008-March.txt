PKP OJS is not an easy system to figure out the OAI baseURL from. The best I
can do is offer you examples to try (all these should work):
http://rea.uninet.edu/index.php/ojs/oai/
http://ojs.c3sl.ufpr.br/ojs2/index.php/ufpr/oai
http://server01.bc.unicamp.br/seer/ojs/oai/
http://www.raco.cat/index.php/index/oai/
http://www.cimec.org.ar/ojs/index.php/cmm/oai

I hope that helps. I think in the long run the best thing to do is contact
the owners of PKP OJS and ask them what is the appropriate baseURL to use.

This is great, that documentation exists. I would be interested in seeing
the relevant section, if someone is willing share.

I think the question of why the different baseURLs listed below all work
remains. If there is one (or two, if you want to harvest only one journal)
path to follow to create a baseURL, why do all the baseURLs I mentioned
work? Even taking into account different versions of the software, the
process seems confused.

After some discussion off list, Alec has kindly provided the following steps
to determine a PKP OJS baseURL. In some cases, there will be exceptions.
However, the manager of the project should be informed of the baseURL during
indexing and can forward that to the harvester.

Alec is happy to answer any questions that arise.

hi Atanu

this is a good question that i will try to answer, based on a fading 
memory ...

in the 90s we had a few large subject repositories around the world 
(like arXiv) but they were mostly not (financially) sustainable as they 
were run by poor scholarly societies, there was a silo effect (with the 
owners of data trying to provide services as well) and the model simply 
did not replicate to all disciplines (we were stuck with a handful of 
poster child repositories) ... in some senses, this "crisis" in subject 
repositories led to the Santa Fe meeting of the OAI.

to address especially the sustainability problem, open access advocates 
began to recommend institutional repositories rather than subject 
repositories because scholarship is a primary function of institutions 
and if anything will be here hundreds of years from now it will be the 
institutions of higher learning.

the core idea of OAI-PMH was therefore to bridge between sustainable 
repositories (e.g., IRs, although the term did not exist back then) and 
high quality service providers (e.g., those hosted by scholarly societies)

so OAI-PMH is supposed to give us the best of both worlds. it is 
tempting to believe that global subject repositories will be a better 
model, but this did not work in the 90s. maybe it will work now (maybe 
scholarly societies, research agencies, etc. have deeper pockets now) - 
we dont know for sure - but who is willing to invest a lot of money and 
many years on redoing an experiment that failed in many instances not 
too long ago?

ttfn,

Not only are the advantages of central repositories (CRs) over institutional
repositories (IRs) not obvious, but the pro's of IRs vastly outweigh
those of CRs on every count:

(1) The research providers are not a central entity but a worldwide
network of independent research institutions (mostly universities).

(2) Those independent institutions share with their own researchers a
direct (and even somewhat competitive) interest in archiving, evaluating,
showcasing, and maximizing the usage and impact of their own research
output. (Most institutions already have IRs, and there are provisional
back-up CRs such as Depot for institutionally unaffiliated researchers
or those whose institutions don't yet have their own IR.)
http://roar.eprints.org/
http://deposit.depot.edina.ac.uk/

(3) The OAI protocol has made all these distributed institutions'
repositories interoperable, meaning that their metadata (or data) can all be
harvested into multiple central collections, as desired, and searched,
navigated and data-mined at that level. (Distributed archiving is also
important for mirroring, backup and preservation.)

(4) Deposit takes the same (small) number of keystrokes institutionally
or centrally, so there is no difference there; but researchers normally
have one IR whereas the potential CRs for their work are multiple. (The
only "global" CR is Google, and that's harvested.)
http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/10688/

(5) The distributed costs of institutional self-archiving are certainly
lower than than maintaining CRs (how many? for what fields? and who
maintains them and pays their costs?), particularly as the costs of a
local IR are low, and they can cover all of an institution's research
output as well as many other forms of institutional digital assets.

(6) Most important of all, although research funders can reinforce
self-archiving mandates, the natural and universal way to ensure that IRs
(and hence harvested CRs) are actually filled with all of the world's
research output, funded and unfunded, is for institutions to mandate
and monitor the self-archiving of their own research output, in their
own IRs, rather than hoping it will find its way willy-nilly into
external CRs.
http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/

This topic has been much discussed since in the American Scientist
Open Access Forum. See the topic threads "Central vs. Distributed
Archives" (since 1999) and "Central versus institutional self-archiving".

  Your memory is indeed fading.

  The Santa Fe meeting was informed by work of a group of authors:

Herbert Van de Sompel, Thomas Krichel, Michael L. Nelson, Patrick
Hochstenbach, Victor M. Lyapunov, Kurt Maly, Mohammad Zubair, Mohamed
Kholief, Xiaoming Liu, and Heath O'Connell, The UPS Prototype project:
exploring the obstacles in creating across e-print archive end-user
service, Old Dominion University Computer Science TR 2000-01, February
2000.

  This is the full version. There is a censored version of it that
  apeared in D-LIB magazine, but the above is the full version, 
  I still have a copy at

http://openlib.org/home/krichel/papers/upsproto.pdf

  The project looked at building a user service uniting
  contents from the following archives: arXiv, CogPrints, NACA,
  NCSTRL, NDLTD and RePEc.

  Out of these NCSTRL is out of business, it was NSF funded, as 
  soon as the funding stopped, it was dropped, bascially. Thus
 
http://dlib.cs.odu.edu/publications.htm

  has a link to the full version, but it's a dead link to
  a server at Cornell where NCSTRL services lived. But 
  all the others are still in business.

  I would be interested in seeing a list of these "many instances".

  There is indeed a problem of grant-funded digital libraries
  failing when the grant expires. This continues to be a serious
  problem. But I don't think this was the impetus for the OAI
  work.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI4J - a PMH and ORE library in Java
Message-ID: <C3B6E4CB-7BFF-42C1-A985-E6AF15EFB4DE@kb.se>

Hi everyone!

My name is Oskar Grenholm and I work as a programmer at The National  
Library of Sweden.

Due to the fact that I couldn't find a nice Java library for  
harvesting OAI-PMH records (in an OO fashion) I wrote my own some  
time ago. This API tries to use a more object-oriented, Java approach  
to harvesting and parsing the results than for example oaiharvester2  
from OCLC (but in fact it uses oaiharvester2 to do the low-level work  
and then builds a new interface on top of that). All the different  
responses are implemented as Java classes that has getters that can  
parse out the relevant information (instead of just getting a W3C Xml  
Document back from oaiharvester2).

To add to this I have also implemented a first (basic) version of a  
Java API for OAI-ORE (according to the specs available at the  
moment), since I got home from the ORE rollout last week. The idea  
here is that you have classses that represents ResourceMap,  
Aggregation and AggregatedResource on which you can call different  
methods to get or set data. There are also a ResourceMapFactory  
interface and a ResourceMapSerializer interface. You can then have  
implementations of those to parse and serialize REMs to different  
formats, i.e Atom and RDF/XML. At the moment only an AtomFactory and  
an AtomSerializer are implemented (since I feel my knowledge of RDF  
is not up to speed).

So with this API you could build (or parse exsting) ResourceMaps and  
then do work on them programmatically and finally serialize them (or  
act upon them as you wish).

I am thinking of releasing it as open-source and have it available on  
Sourceforge. So now my question to all of you is, would anyone be  
interrested in this? To use or perhaps just help out a little and  
give feedback on?

Best regards,
Oskar Grenholm

Consider me interested :) I'd certainly like to take a look at what you
have, and may be able to contribute in some way.

Dear all

If any of you currently harvest metadata from Cranfield QUEprints, 
the Cranfield University institutional repository, please note that are
relaunching/rebranding the repository with a new name: Cranfield CERES. (The
Cranfield Collection of E-RESearch.)

Our baseURL, however, remains the same:

Hi everybody!

The National Library of Sweden has released OAI4J, a client library for OAI-PMH and OAI-ORE written in Java, as Open Source. The project is hosted on Sourceforge and can be found at:

   http://oai4j-client.sourceforge.net

There you can find links to a binary download, Java documentation for the API and some examples to get you started. The source code can also be found and downloaded with the help of Subversion. 

OAI4J is released as Open Source under the Apache License, version 2.0.

Features:
 - OAI-PMH
   * Convenient Java API that lets you perform queries and handle the harvested data in 
     an object-oriented fashion.
   * Handles all the verbs and responses of OAI-PMH.    

 - OAI-ORE
   * Lets you create and build Resource Maps from scratch programmatically.
   * Handles parsing of existing Resource Maps written as Atom feeds.
   * Allows Resource Map objects to be serialized into Atom feeds.
   * Could be extended to also handle RDF/XML parsing/serialization.


Any comments, questions or other feedback are appreciated. But for the coming days I will be out of the office, so e-mails might not get answered until mid-next week. 

Best regards,
Oskar Grenholm

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI-ORE add-on service for Fedora
Message-ID: <C412AFAE.3A29%oskar.grenholm@kb.se>

Hi!

I have recently played around with writing a prototype for exposing digital
objects stored in a Fedora repository as OAI-ORE Resource Maps.

I have now put the result on Sourceforge as Open Source (under the Apache
License, v.2), where it can be found at:

    http://oreprovider.sourceforge.net

The idea behind it all is that you have a Java web application
(oreprovider.war) that, on the fly, will generate Resource Maps serialized
as Atom feeds (using OAI4J) for objects in Fedora. All you have to do in
Fedora is to add information in RELS-EXT what datastreams belongs to which
Resource Map (exactly how to do this can be seen at the projects web page).
 
I'm not sure whether anyone is interrested in this, but if so feel free to
download and test it and provide feedback where necessary.


Best regards, 
Oskar Grenholm

Hello -

I co-direct a nonprofit organization called IssueLab. We are an online
publishing forum for nonprofit-produced research. We'd like to implement a
data harvester.

Our site is built on a Linux-Apache-MySQLv5-PHPv5 platform. I have been
looking around for software to deploy and I ran across OAIbiblio which seems
spot on for our needs. But, while attempting to install it we have run into
a problem.

I downloaded the .tar archive available at http://www.ibiblio.org/oaibiblio/.
Read through the install file and noticed that two folders and their
requisite files were missing:

1) "transform: ("Handles metadata format mappings and transformations") with
a sub-folder labeled "xsl" ("Holds xsl files; each xsl file represents a
transformation")

2) folder: "docs"

I have sent a note to the author of the software but haven't heard anything
back. Is this software obsolete? If not is there another complete download I
can grab from somewhere or does someone have this and is able to share it
with us? I haven't been able to track down any link except the one referred
to above. Also, does anyone know of any other PHP data harvesting software?

Thanks so much for any help/insight!

Subject: [OAI-implementers] metadata formats - supporting multiple versions
Message-ID: <89D12171D3EA6E48900F2B7BF14864EA12CA44946E@iu-mssg-mbx06.ads.iu.edu>

Hello all,

We're growing our OAI-PMH data provider to the point where we need to simultaneously support multiple versions of a metadata schema, for different sets that have been created over time using different versions of a schema.

We're finding this to be an issue specifically with MODS (although the principles would apply for any metadata format that's evolving over time). According to the UIUC OAI-PMH Registry at <http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListSchemas.asp>, the metadata format "mods" is used to refer to three different versions of MODS in different repositories:

http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-0.xsd
http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-1.xsd
http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-2.xsd

Since the ListMetadataFormats response includes both a metadataPrefix and a pointer to a specific schema, I'm concluding that we can't use the same metadataPrefix to refer to different versions of the schema for different sets. Is that correct?

Within the various MODS 3.x versions, we *could* just call all the earlier versions by a newer version number when it comes out, since they're supposed to be backwards-compatible within the major release version. But saying a MODS 3.0 record is MODS 3.2 implies we've done the work to use some of the (very useful!) new features of MODS 3.2, when in fact we haven't. And given the realities of a production environment, we won't be able to spend the time to upgrade all the existing MODS records whenever a new set wants to take advantage of a feature in a newer version of MODS. Also, this fake upgrading approach wouldn't work when a new major release version comes out that's not backwards compatible. Based on all of this I'm thinking we need different metadataPrefix-es for different versions of the schema.

I'm not seeing in the UIUC registry any good examples of versioning a metadataPrefix that I could follow as a best practice, though. The only metadataPrefix-es listed there that seem at first glance to be versioned are junii vs. junii2, but I'm not familiar with those schemas so I can't say for sure that's what they're trying to do.

So what would be the best way to create "versioned" metadataPrefix-es? Something like mods_3.0, mods_3.1, and mods_3.2? Has anybody thought through these issues enough that there's a model we could follow? There's nothing on the DLF/NSDL OAI Best Practices page on namespaces and schemas <http://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/oaibp/index.php/NamespacesAndSchemas> that addresses this specific issue.

If we were to use different metadata prefixes, would this cause big problems for service providers trying to use this metadata? Or is there a way to do this with a single metadataPrefix I'm not thinking of?

According to the UIUC OAI-PMH Registry at <http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListSchemas.asp>, the metadata format "mods" is used to refer to three different versions of MODS in different repositories:

But saying a MODS 3.0 record is MODS 3.2 implies we've done the work to use some of the (very useful!) new features of MODS 3.2, when in fact we haven't. And given the realities of a production environment, we won't be able to spend the time to upgrade all the existing MODS records whenever a new set wants to take advantage of a feature in a newer version of MODS. Also, this fake upgrading approach wouldn't work when a new major release version comes out that's not backwards compatible. Based on all of this I'm thinking we need different metadataPrefix-es for different versions of the schema.

Interesting question, and one that could be relevant to us here (though 
currently we've just picked one schema). If there were, say, an 
incompatible upgrade to MODS 4, I could see wanting to support both the 
old and new MODS for a while till everyone was up to speed on the new 
version.

I think going with different metadata prefixes would be the only 
solution, but don't know of any standard nomenclature. In theory it 
shouldn't matter what prefix you use, since XML considers the namespace 
prefix just a pointer to the schema. But since the prefix is what the 
harvester actually uses, consistency would be nice.
