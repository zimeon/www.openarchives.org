Hi again,

Thanks Simon for your answer.
The problem is, we have registered successfully 11 repositories and we have
not changed anything from the software we are using, so i guess the
registering process has changed, it could be?...

Thanks in advance,
Maite.

*** OAI Set Proposal: Devolve Sets to Subsidiary URL Access Points ***

Author:  	Rob Sanderson (azaroth@liv.ac.uk)
Contributors:  	Ralph Levan   (levan@oclc.org)
 		Jeff Young    (jyoung@oclc.org)


Problem:

There have been many issues identified by the OAI community with the 
interoperability of sets, set descriptions and the out-of-band communications 
between data provider and service provider required to either create new sets 
or determine the nature of sets if the description is insufficient or not 
present.
Furthermore, given the present set specification, there has yet to be a 
consistent approach described to having a hierarchical structure of sets, nor a 
way to specify that a record has been deleted from a set, but not from the 
repository as a whole.
When populating set descriptions, it is possible to have some subsets make 
their records available in a different set of schemas to other subsets and it 
is not clear that this should be permitted at all, and if it should, how to 
unambiguously specify the set's capabilities.


Proposal:

Instead of furthering the misconception that sets are a weak form of search, 
due primarily to the lack of explicit semantics as to how sets should be 
defined, sub-collections could instead be treated as separate OAI repositories 
without any change to the existing protocol.  These subsidiary repositories 
typically would be an extended path from the base provider's URL.

For example, an OAI interface might be available at:
 	http://oai.cheshire3.org/liverpoolArchives/
The server might then support sub-collections of the full archives at:
 	http://oai.cheshire3.org/liverpoolArchives/gypsy/
 	http://oai.cheshire3.org/liverpoolArchives/cunard/ and
 	http://oai.cheshire3.org/liverpoolArchives/cunard/titanic/


Commentary:

Additional URL paths are free for practically all intents and purposes. Once a 
service can be made to listen at one URL, additional listening points below are 
much easier.  Thus the infrastructure of the web is made to assume part of the 
technical requirements of the protocol.

Not only does this shift a part of the burden on to the infrastructure, it 
enables various implementation strategies not currently available. Instead of 
one repository maintaining the complete collection and all of the sets, 
sub-collections could be handled either by one repository implementation or by 
running a new instance for each subsidiary URL/set. This second method lowers 
the barrier-to-entry for supporting sub-collections as a data provider.

This solves the tree-of-sets issue with no additional requirements. Because 
there is no (practical) limit on the length of a URL path, the depth of the 
sub-collections is likewise not technically limited.  The context is also more 
apparent, as it is present in the URL.

It also solves the problem of not being able to signal the deletion of records 
out of sets when they have not been deleted from the repository. For example, 
if a record were moved from one set into another, the record could be flagged 
as deleted in the repository maintaining the first set, and recently added to 
its new location.  This is not currently possible and requires periodic 
complete reharvesting.

The misperception regarding sets as a filter or search, rather than access to a 
well defined sub-collection is greatly lessened by the proposal. Instead of 
having a parameter carried in the request, which can easily be abused, the new 
URLs imply much more strongly that this is a well defined OAI service, 
especially as it is one.  This lessens the likelihood that service providers 
will contact the data provider asking for new sets [whether or not that is an 
advantage is easily debatable], and also the likelihood that searches will be 
crushed into the set parameter.

Benefits also accrue for the service providers as they do not have to implement 
set handling for the approximately half of the total data providers that 
support them [as per Thomas Habing's registry].  The move from the set 
specification to linked services also means that service providers will 
actually process the friends information, which otherwise may be ignored.

If there is one record which appears in multiple sets, then it will appear in 
each OAI repository instance.  Also, the records should all appear at the base 
OAI repository.  Even though these are different instances, the sets should 
have the same unique identifier such that they can be deduplicated if and when 
necessary.  The protocol specifically allows for common identifier schemes to 
be defined, so there seems to be no technical issue with this.


Technical Requirements:

The technical requirement for discovering these sets would be done via a 
slightly enhanced version of the Friends schema.  Each repository instance 
would maintain the next lowest level of sets.  In the examples given in the 
description, liverpoolArchives would link to gypsy and cunard. Cunard would 
then link to its sub-set about the Titanic.  Each set would also link upwards 
to its super-set.

Each friend entry needs to identify the relationship between the current 
repository instance and the friend.  As an example, this could be accomplished 
by a type attribute, with a default value of 'relatedCollection' for backwards 
compatibility.

<f:friends type=subCollection>
 	http://oai.cheshire3.org/liverpoolArchives/cunard/titanic
</f:friends>
<f:friends type=superCollection>
 	http://oai.cheshire3.org/liverpoolArchives/
</f:friends>
<f:friends type=relatedCollection>
 	http://some.other.repository.edu/path/to/oai/
</f:friends>

The need for the link upwards is that the services may be provided by systems 
that do not work by url path elements, and instead use some other system. For 
example a less sophisticated, but equally valid approach would be to name CGI 
scripts with increasingly long names within the same directory.  For example:
 	http://www.cheshire3.org/cgi/oai-liverpool.cgi
 	http://www.cheshire3.org/cgi/oai-liverpool-gypsy.cgi
 	http://www.cheshire3.org/cgi/oai-liverpool-cunard-titanic.cgi

The sub-collection description would then be moved into the Identify response 
from the listSets response.  This has the advantage of only requiring service 
providers to process one sort of collection/service description rather than 
two.  Secondly it means that the best practices regarding the Identify response 
would also apply to any sub-collections, increasing the likelihood of content 
providers describing their sets appropriately.

I know it was rather presumptuous to suggest changes to the protocol. :-)

Regarding status="deleted", I am pretty sure that the spec currently 
puts this at the record level and not the item level.  A suggested 
change to the protocol might be to define sets as containing records 
instead of containing items.  Although, I don't think this would fix the 
problem of how to signal when a record has been moved from a set.

I'll also admit to somewhat playing devils advocate, because I kind of 
like Rob's solution, but I can't shake some misgivings which I am having 
a hard time articulating.  Perhaps the problem is that there are several 
different issues with sets, and I'm not sure which of these we are 
really trying to address.

1) The tendency of people to misunderstand sets as a sort of poor man's 
search.

2) Technical issues relating to how to signal that a record has been 
moved out of a set, but has not been deleted from the repository.

3) How best to describe a set: there is a technical description such as 
how many items are in the set and what the updated frequency is.  There 
is also the conceptual description, such as the records in this set are 
all described by this subject heading, or they all belong to this 
"collection," or they all have this publishing status.

4) Issues such as whether its a good idea to have overlapping sets, flat 
sets, hierarchical sets, and in which circumstances.

5) Variations in how different implementers have interpretted the OAI 
"data model".

Briefly some of my misgivings:

Does Rob's model place an excessive burden on data providers, or service 
providers?

Does it fundamentally alter the underlying data model of OAI, for better 
or worse?  Previously, I think that items belonged to one or more sets, 
and records were disseminations of these items in a specific format.  I 
think Rob's model alters this to something like records being 
disseminations of items within the context of those items being 
contained in a particular set.  In other words, the oai_dc record in set 
A could be different than the oai_dc record in set B, for the same item; 
they could have different datestamps, and different delete statuses.  I 
might try to describe this better with a little relation diagram later. 
  But the issue is do we want to encourage this sort of model?

Been rambling too long.  Curious as to what others think.

*** OAI Set Proposal: Devolve Sets to Subsidiary URL Access Points ***

The need for the link upwards is that the services may be provided by

The sub-collection description would then be moved into the Identify 
response from the listSets response.  This has the advantage of only 
requiring service providers to process one sort of collection/service 
description rather than two.  Secondly it means that the best practices 
regarding the Identify response would also apply to any sub-collections, 
increasing the likelihood of content providers describing their sets 
appropriately.

I think that by moving the set name into the URL it doesn't get rid of 
this, but it does lessen the tendancy to think this way.  When it's a 
parameter in the query, it's easy to cram any arbitrary value in there. 
It's less intuitive to do this when the set name is part of the URL.

This wasn't something I was thinking of when writing it up, but it does 
fall out neatly from the proposal -- you simply set them deleted in the 
set repository.

The advantage here is that you have all of the best practices and schemas 
for the Identify verb for the set descriptions. What exactly 
to put in here is still in need of work, but I think it's a good start to 
allow the full Identify information.

Whether it's a good idea? I'm not going to comment on that, besides the 
point that there are heirarchical collections and sub-collections, so it's 
natural to describe these in a hierarchical tree of sets.
The main advantage here is that everything falls out neatly -- if you want 
a tree, then design your URLs to be a tree.  If you want overlapping, flat 
or any other design, then it's up to the design of the URL paths, not the 
protocol to try and fit all of the requirements.

I don't think that the proposal addresses this.

The burden on the data providers can be done in at least two different 
ways -- either multiple instances of the script, or one server which 
handles everything.  Multiple instances is easier than the status quo (no 
sets, no extra URLs).  One server is as hard as the status quo, but 
depending on the underlying architecture it may be no more difficult, or 
it may be quite a bit harder (at which point, there's always multiple 
instances of the server code)

For service providers, it should be easier, as they can simply follow the 
links in the <friends> section, rather than having to construct parameters 
from the listSets response.

Mmmmm. I have no real comment here.  There's nothing to prevent you from 
having different representations of the same object disseminated in 
different sets, but that's no different to today where some providers make 
sets available per record schema.

I think that's a best practice issue which should be addressed, but is 
mostly orthogonal to the proposal?

Hi Ben,

If an item is in Collections:Col1 then the headers for record from that
item should include only that setSpec and not Collections. The spec says:

"The list of setSpec [elements] should include only the minimum number of
setSpec [elements] required to specify the set membership. Using the
previous example of a set hierarchy, the header for an item organized in
set institution:florida should not include setSpec institution since that
is implied by the setSpec institution:florida."
(first bullet of the last set of bullers in sec2.6 Sets,

Cheers,
Simeon
