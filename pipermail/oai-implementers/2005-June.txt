Subject: [OAI-implementers] Selective Harvesting and Datestamps
Message-ID: <42A8307E.7070709@infrae.com>

Hi there,

I'm implementing an OAI server and am wondering about the details of
selective harvesting in date ranges.

The spec says:

   modification - the response *must* include records, corresponding to
   the metadataPrefix argument, which have changed within the bounds of
   the from and until arguments.

Does this mean that records need to track their full history of modified
dates? Just tracking their last modified datestamp does not seem enough
to fully comply with this, as a record modified on 2005-04-10 and then
again on 2005-06-05 would not show up in the range 2005-03-01 - 
2005-05-01, as it would only be known it was modified 2005-06-05.

On the other hand, there seems to be no requirement that a modified
record gets exposed in its original, historical state; i.e. historical 
revisions of metadata do not need to be retained to comply. This means 
that in fact someone harvesting between 2005-03-01 - 2005-05-01 would 
see all records in the most recent state anyway, thus including the 
2005-06-05 change.

It therefore seems that for incremental date-based harvesting to work,
full historical information about modification dates is not strictly
necessary, as at the end of a full harvest throughout the full date 
range all the data *will* be correctly sent to the harvester..

Tracking a full history of modification dates for all records seems like 
an onerous requirement. Is this really the intent? Does it really hurt 
if only last-modified dates are retained? Am I misreading the spec?

Regards,

Martijn

It was intended to mean only the most recent changes. Thus, only the last
modification date for each record needs to be recorded. Looking at the
spec I see it is only implied that records have a single datestamp
associated with them:

Records are only ever exposed in their current state, a complete
modification history is not required.

Correct, only the last-modified dates need to be maintained.

Right, I saw vague hints that this was the case, and I couldn't imagine 
it being otherwise, but a strict reading of the spec implies otherwise. 
Perhaps a clarification can be added to the implemention guidelines.

Thanks!

Hi Daniel,

on linux you can extract it with tar, here an example

 tar zxvf phpoai2-1.7.1.gz

the z option is to uncompress it

Hopignt that it solve

Dear Daniel,

actually, it is a .tgz file which means that this file a gzipped tar 
archive, which is mostly used in the unix world, but many windows 
programs are able to read such archives, too.

However just replace phpoai2-1.7.1.tgz by phpoai2-1.7.1.zip and you will
get a zip file, which I guess is more suitable for you.

I have never tested phpoai2 with windows, but it should run ok. 
If you have problems or feedback, please contact me directly via mail.

Greetings, Heinrich

Subject: [OAI-implementers] DCMI Recommendation on Bibliographic Citations
Message-ID: <mailman.0.1118832000.1440.oai-implementers@openarchives.org>

Dear All,

[Apologies for cross posting.]

I'm pleased to report that the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative has published
a Recommendation (http://www.dublincore.org/documents/#recommendation): 

Guidelines for Encoding Bibliographic Citation Information in Dublin Core
Metadata

http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dc-citation-guidelines/

This recommendation uses an OpenURL Framework ContextObject to describe a
machine-parsable citation.

It is primarily about capturing the bibliographic citation information about
a journal article (for example) within its own metadata for which it
recommends the DC property 'dcterms:bibliographicCitation', which is an
element refinement of 'dc:identifier', but also includes recommendations for
capturing references in 'dcterms:references'. But this could easily be
extrapolated to using a recommended parsable citation as the value of a
'dc:source' property, for example when capturing the publication citation
for an eprint.

Also the recommendations in the document assume that 'qualified' DC is being
used, ie. with the availability of all the 'dcterms' properties. But it does
also give guidelines for using simple Dublin Core.

Best wishes,
	Ann

Dear all

If any of you currently harvest metadata from Cranfield QUEprints - the

following change...
 
We've just upgraded QUEprints to the latest version of DSpace, which
means our baseURL has changed to:
