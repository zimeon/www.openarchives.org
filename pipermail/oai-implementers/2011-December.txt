Hello,

I am wondering if there is a standard way to change OAI identifiers.
For example, we might restructure our collection, or will have to split some items that were under one identifier into several ones. I could even imagine something like "throw away everything from this set from this OAI Service Provider and collect everything anew".
Is there a way to communicate this to my OAI clients?

Best regards
Thomas Fischer

I don't believe there's any way for oai-ids to change.  If you want to do
that, you'd have to mark the original as deleted and then create new one.
This should work fine for all your clients.  However, you lose history and
association.  IOW - the client has no way of knowing that records 011 and
012 derived from record 010.  Depending on what you're trying to do, that
might be just fine.

Does creating some new sets provide you with a workaround?

Not really, the sets are rather fixed basic units attached so certain collections, renaming them would create confusion. (Apart from this we should create some new sub-sets, but this is a different question.) And AFAIK there is no way to delete a set either. Then rather discard all the old identifiers and provide new ones. But we'd have to do this without deleting the data in our database...

What about an OAI proxy instead , thus overapplying it to the OAI 
service provider you can rewrite your identifiers

hi Thomas,

Just to share some experience that we have had at the UK Data Archive. One of our partner organizations, from where we harvester data, went through a redesign/redevelopment of its applications, and as a consequence changed not only their OIA identifiers but links for OAI calls, as as well.



This gave us significant problems, including data consistance. As changing identifiers data become completely inconsistent<http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inconsistent>.

Therefore, as a suggestion, if I understood you right. If changing identifers is essential for you, do it in partnership with organziations/institutions you exchange data.



one workaround, would  be to write a wrapper which would mimic the behavior of your old OAI, hence mapping the old dentifiers to the new ones.  You would expose the this wrrapper to institutions that already query your OAI

Hi Thomas
I?m afraid the issue you are raising is out of the scope of OAI, as IMHO it
is part of the ?upper level? of the business.
 
In fact, in a properly designed data/entity architecture, records should
have two identifiers, one absolute, purely logical, and persistent (like for
example an ISBN number, DOI, National Bibliographic Number, etc., with no
need to be sequential
), and eventually other ?technical? (as the index in
the database, for example, which tend to be sequential, and this OAI takes
advantage of that). Both can even have be represented by elements in the
data record
 
 
The problem is that when people design the systems they usually only use the
second, either by ignorance or by simplicity
 For example, if you use
logical identifiers, you also must have a mechanism to merge records if you
discover duplicates, and in that case you must keep the two previous
identifiers associated to the new record, etc.
 
In a scenario of a system properly  designed, if the OAI identifiers change,
that should be seem ?at the OAI level? as a simple change in the record, so
all the records should be harvested again, and end of story at the OAI
level

 
Than it?d be up to the next level of the business to discover what really
was the change in the record and how it affects the business of the service
provider that harvested it
 If the data provider did it properly, by using
the logical identifiers the service providers can always make the
association of the new records with the old ones
 If not, then I?m afraid
the only options for the service provider are either also throw the old
harvested records (which can be nasty if the service provider already used
them to create any kind of added value, such as associate them to records in
other data sets
) or develop its own heuristics to try to recover the ideal
scenario (for example, to deal with that in the REPOX framework, when a data
set is harvested and the data has no logical identifiers, we make it
possible for REPOX to generate those identifiers, based on simples
techniques that use the content of the record but we assume in most of the
cases will generate the same identifier if the record is not changed in some
key identifiers ?this is just a simple heuristic, not 100% effective, but at
leat we try ;-)
 
Best!
Jos? Borbinha

Well, the actual metadata transported by OAI-MPH may have concepts of
mergend or moved records, but we can easily state that oai_dc doesn't
and OAI-PMH itself (those things transported in the header) has (optional)
provisions for deleted records, but not for merging or moving.

I'm quite certain that there is no universally agreed semantics for
merging or moving of records let alone the impact on their corresponding
identifiers or analogous operations on the repository level (relabeling,
moving or merging whole repositories ... with no impact on the actual
metadata). One could define an extension format to communicate changes on
the identifier level, but its use would be severeley restricted to the
originating repository and its underlying data model and operationals
concepts...

Thus, moved identifiers are technically a case of deleting the old
record and creating a new one (and merged records alike: deliberate
duplication on the OAI level does sound more a headache than a
viable option).

If the repository does not support deleted records, you would simply have
to relabel your identifiers and shift the Earliest Datestamp, forcing all
harvesters to reload everything (and for identifying the deletions
they have always been on their own). But if you advertise deleted
records, then you'll forever have to document and deliver any old
identifiers as deleted ones.

Another question is, whether relabeling of identifiers (or moving whole
repositories) can be realized on the HTTP level: Would harvesters
break if a request for identifier A in repository X returns a redirect
to a response for identifier B (in repository Y)? They probably would...
And with respect to incremental harvesting and ListIdentifiers or
ListRecords requests one HTTP status code cannot communicate that
each one of a bunch of identifiers returned would be the redirection
target of a hypothetical GetRecord request for an old identifier
we don't name...

I'd recommend to set up a completely new repository under a different
address, constituting the most drastical break and inform off-band
(mail, website, ...) all those who care about the transformations
necessary to old identifiers in order to turn the transition into
a seamless one.
