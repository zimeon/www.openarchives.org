Subject: [OAI-implementers] Schema for Vanilla XML?
Message-ID: <C6F0FFCF.1EA10%t.hammond@nature.com>

Hi:

Pardon me as this is probably a very dumb question. But how might one send
vanilla XML (either with DTD or without - but no schema) as an OAI-PMH
metadata record? That is, to use OAI-PMH as a delivery mechanism for
arbitary XML.

Is there any generic schema-based XML wrapper that could be used? Or could
the XML be sent as oai_dc property? Or might there be some other way to
approach this?

Cheers,

Tony

Hi Tony,

We have dealt with this in the context of exchanging ORE resource maps via 
OAI-PMH [1]. One can create a schema that says that inside a wrapper element 
then content need only be well-formed and not accord to a schema. You can see 
this in the schema for RDF content:

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/rdf.xsd

which defines an <RDF> wrapper element and says that the content is:

<sequence maxOccurs="unbounded">
   <any namespace="##any" processContents="lax"/>
</sequence>


Cheers,
Simeon

Subject: [OAI-implementers] New member and looking for advise
Message-ID: <3db7a6a20910060807r627310c5jee79798ca994c44f@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am a new bee in this forum and am looking forward to spying on every post
from now on. I am actally involved in a project aiming at web resources
preservation. Our's is a very limited approach to preservation in that we
don't collect web resources automatically but collect them manually after
sorting out copyright and IPR issues. We are now considering long term
digital preservation of these web resources which we are amassing in our web
site. At the same time we want to enable our server process OAI-PMH requests
in order ro share our resources with other interoperable repository network
compatible with such protocols. I am currently testing mod_oai in a testing
environment and have configured various automatic metadata utilities on our
apache 2.0 web server to check server efficiency and processing for both
http and OAI_PMH queries. Could somebody advise if I am doing the right
thing and conitnue further testing until I finally configured our LIVE
server ?

I am also reading about OAI_ORE but obviously, keeping in view the
effectiveness of mod_oai in terms of automatic metadata
preservation,harvesting on during dissemination and long term preservation,
I am quite tempted to continue implementing it. Please advise.

thanks


Arshad

Thanks, Simeon.

Suspected as much but good to see that confirmed. Also wanted to doublecheck
there wasn't any standard issue wrapper schema for this.

Cheers,

Tony

Subject: [OAI-implementers] metadata in the "archiving and interchange
	format version 3.0"
Message-ID: <561B608813F3E7448D792A51EF2AB03E058EC47A@EXCLUSTER.fiz-karlsruhe.de>

Dear all,

we have metadata in the "archiving and interchange format version 3.0"
format (http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/3.0/w3c-schema.html#id47441)
in our repository and we want to provide this metadata via OAI-PMH. But
the xml schema for this format
(http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/3.0/xsd/archivearticle3.xsd) does not
specify a target namespace. On the other hand the OAI-PMH specification
requires a declaration of a metadata format specific namespace in a
metadata part of a OAI-PMH record. Also a list of metadata formats must
contain a namespace uri for each format from the list (request
ListMetadataFormats). 

Has anybody run into a similar problem?

Thanks a lot,
Rozita
