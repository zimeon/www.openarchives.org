Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI Repository Explorer -- difficulties
	connecting
Message-ID: <s4058aad.038@loc.gov>


Is anyone else having problems accessing the OAI Repository Explorer at http://re.cs.uct.ac.za/ ?

I have been having problems since the weekend, manifesting as a timeout in Firefox or Page Not Found in IE.  Not sure when I last used it without a problem.  Over the weekend, I did make contact at one stage, but since Monday, all attempts have failed.

I like to use the RE to test out things when I release a new OAI set.  It has been very useful in identifying problems in the source metadata records that will cause problems for harvesters.

   Thanks for any information about what is going on.

hi Caroline

sorry about the spotty access recently ... we've had power problems in 
Cape Town over the last 2 weeks ... it is very unusual and hopefully 
will be sorted out soon.

ttfn,

I have no doubt that someone has already addressed this, so I would appreciate

I just discovered that we have a number of ETDs that have a ton of supporting
filestreams (three of them have hundreds.  Seriously!)  There is nothing in
the incoming metadata to indicate that these filestreams exist, much less what
their mime types are, or relationship to the primary filestream (a pdf).  I
was informed that the students have been instructed to link these streams as
relative URLs within their pdfs, but there is nothing in place to ensure that
all files are linked, or linked correctly.  And if the pdf is "harvested" and
then accessed out of context, of course none of those links will work.

In the OAI records I've been creating, I've simply referred to the pdf file
for type, format, and identifier.  What *should* I be doing here?

I have no administrative, structural, or preservation metadata for the
supporting filestreams.  It would be simple enough to create redirect links
(my local version of sustainable URLs) for each bitstream, and add those into
the appropriate OAI records as dc:identifiers, but good gracious!  Hundreds? 
Best practice is one!  Plus there would still be nothing to ID the type/format

We had to face already that problem at the National Digital Library in
Portugal. Our infrastructure is "METS based", so ultimately soon or latter
all those objects will be properly described in that way, but until now we
could not develop yet solutions for all the genres (we have thesis, but also
lots of other genres...). And sometimes the objects can not wait...

The pragmatic solution we are using now is simply to create an HTML
"home-page" for each of those objects, which only link to each file. When
possible, we add also some descriptive information to the top of the page
(title, author, ..). Than we create a metadata record pointing to that HTML
file. If the object has PDFs, sound, etc., we identify it as a HTML MIME
type object. If it is just a group of PDF files, or Word, etc., we identify
according to its specific MIME object. By default, it is a HTML object!!!

We use the same solution for objects that arrive to us in multiple CDs or
DVDs, for example, and that we want to put on-line. 

Here is an example that I found fast (with a fancy webpage... usually they
are not so nice):

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Sets and multiple formats
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0603091323320.22250@flood.dpc.ucar.edu>


We are reconsidering the way we define sets and the following question 
has come up: Does it make sense to define a set that includes records 
from two fundamentally different metadata formats or is it better to 
stick to one format per set?

For example, suppose a repository contains the following metadata 
formats:

metadataPrefix=oai_dc
metadataPrefix=annotations_for_oai_dc

Is it better to have a single set that includes records from both of 
the above, such as:

setSpec=records_and_annotations_about_oceans

or better to split the sets by format:

setSpec=records_about_oceans
setSpec=annotations_about_oceans

Or is either approach equally OK?

I'm curious what others have done in this regard and whether there are 
any conventions that have taken shape?

Thanks,

  -john


PS:

The OAI protocol defines sets in the following way:

"The actual meaning of a set or of the arrangement of sets in a
repository is not defined in the protocol. It is expected that
individual communities may formulate well-defined set configurations
with perhaps a controlled vocabulary for setNames and setSpec , and
may even develop mechanisms for exposing these to harvesters. For
example, a group of cooperating e-print archives in a specific
discipline may agree on sets that arrange metadata in their
repositories based on a controlled subject classification."

I do not see any discussion in the documentation about the singularity
or multiplicity of metadata formats in respect to sets.

Given that you must specify the metadata format for all harvesting, included
selective harvesting, it makes sense to have your sets group items without
regard to format.

That is:

setSpec:oceans

When a harvester makes a request:

ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&setSpec=oceans

ListRecords&metadataPrefix=anotherFormat&setSpec=oceans
---------
However, since you use "annotations" as your example second format, the
question may be whether your "annotations_for_oai_dc" is truly another
metadata format (a different view of the same item, to use OAI-PMH parlance),
or whether it's different content.

Also, records can belong to multiple sets:

setSpec:allDataAboutOceans
setSpec:annotationsAboutOceans

John,

I agree with Naomi. You could make one set with multiple formats in there
(although as she says, you may actually be talking about different views of
the same item). I would encourage you to also provide sets with consistent
format (additionally). And in all cases, explain what you did and the
formats you used in set descriptions.

Best,

Yes, in this case the annotation_for_oai_dc records contain different, 
but related, content from the oai_dc records, not just a different 
view of the same content.

So, more specifically we have this:

An oai_dc record provides metadata about a given resource: 
http://nasa.gov/resource_123.html

and a related annotation_for_oai_dc record in the repository contains 
an annotation written by a different party for the same resource: 
http://nasa.gov/resource_123.html

As you point out, since these are two truly different formats, the 
protocol does not allow them to be harvested at the same time - you 
would have to harvest the records separately such as:

ListRecords?metadataPrefix=oai_dc&setSpec=oceans
ListRecords?metadataPrefix=annotation_for_oai_dc&setSpec=oceans

Prompted by comments from Eloy Lafuente (copied below) I have added 2 
small clarifications to the oai-identifier v2.0 specification. The new 
version is online at:
   http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-oai-identifier.htm
the new version with changes highlighted in red is at:
   http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-oai-identifier.2006-03-09changes.htm
and the old version is at:
   http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-oai-identifier.2002-06-21.htm

The change from the v1.1 oai-identifier specification to v2.0 meant that 
namespace-identifier part of the identifiers (e.g. arXiv.org in 
oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/9901001) is no longer tied to the registration of a 
single repository. Uniqueness is attained from tying the 
namespace-identifier to DNS registration. I have also changed the 
validator service in accord with this understanding.

Thanks to Carl Lagoze for sanity checks.

Cheers,
Simeon

I have put a reworked version of the OAI validation service online. This 
does a few checks that the old version missed and gives diagnostic

Hi Simeon and all,

I am a little concerned about these changes to the oai-identifier 
recommendation.  While for historical reasons we probably need to allow 
"A single namespace-identifier may be used for identifiers in multiple 
repositories operated by the same organization."  For new repositories, 
I would rather discourage this.

My experience with the OAI Registry at UIUC has shown that it is 
difficult if not impossible to develop useful registry-based services, 
similar to Jeff Youngs ERRoL service, but also other services, unless 
the namespace-identifiers assigned to repositories are unique to just 
that repository.

What we have done when confronted with this problem at UIUC is to 
register domain name aliases for each of our OAI providers, even if 
those OAI providers all reside on the same server.  Thus we have:

aerialphotos.grainger.uiuc.edu
findingaids.grainger.uiuc.edu
ilalive.grainger.uiuc.edu
etc.

Each of these is a registered domain name, but each is just an alias for 
some other domain.

I also suspect that many people might have the misconception that the 
domain name used for the namespace-identifier must or should match the 
domain name of the server which is hosting the data provider (the domain 
name part of the baseURL).  This is also not true, and can cause 
problems for people who might think that if they move their data 
provider to a new baseURL that they need to change all the oai 
identifiers to match.

Although not strictly necessary, this is another advantage of using a 
domain name alias as the namespace-identifier.  If you wanted, you could 
redirect the alias to a new domain if you ever needed to move the 
repository.

So I guess my recommendation would be to temper your revisions somewhat, 
maybe something like this:

Primarily for backward compatibility with previous versions of this 
specification, a single namespace-identifier may be used for identifiers 
in multiple repositories operated by the same organization. The same 
oai-identifier description block would then be used in the responses to 
Identify requests for each repository. However, organizations are 
strongly encouraged to assign a unique namespace-identifier to each of 
their repositories, even if those repositories are served from the same 
host.  Registering domain name aliases for each of these repositories is 
a possible solution that guarantees uniqueness even for repositories 
hosted by the same organization from the same server.  Uniqueness of the 
namespace-identifier is thus guaranteed through domain name registration 
and not through registration with the OAI validation service, as it was 
with v1.0/1.1.


Kind regards,
	Tom Habing

  The Geneva meetings now take place every two years, alternating
  wtih the Nordic Conference. Thus, OAI5 will be in 2007. I am not
  aware of a date yet.

3 Jobs Open for Immediate Start, for Digital Library Techies:  DC Metro
-------------------------------------------------------

I, (Terry Harrison) joined this list a few years ago while getting my Master?s in CS at ODU.  I am now working for CACI (who just acquired my former company ISS), who is managing a 5 year contract to help manage digital preservation efforts with a large government agency in the DC area.

We currently have tasking that requires us to expand our development team and I thought this group would be a great place to connect with some great candidates.  I do apologize in advance if a job posting is not appropriate, but it is done in the desire to promote Digital Library development efforts, so it is my hope that I am doing this in the right spirit. 

In the coming year we are planning to prototype a data submission pipeline between a handful of publishers and value-added content providers and the government agency. This is an area where recent hands-on experience, rather than academic qualifications or certifications would count a lot.  

Although experience with big-agency and big-project process is desired... we are building a small, agile, prototyping team, and members will be wearing many hats. This is a very exciting opportunity for high-octane techies to join a team that will prototype systems, services, and standards that have the potential to influence and shape the way all the media and publishing industries connect and communicate with cultural heritage institutions such as libraries, archives and museums.


We are looking to add the following to our team, which will be based offsite, in the Washington DC Metro area.  Some telecommuting may be possible.

1    Software engineer, lead
1    Software QA specialist
1    Systems Analyst

I will include a description of the qualifications we are looking for below.  Interested parties should send their resume and cover letter to:

"Sustainability" is really just another word for *survival*. Open source
projects either survive or they do not. But what makes one project
survive and another die? And does the answer matter?

*Open Source and Sustainability*

The answer *does* matter.

  * first, to the project itself and to all those individuals committing
their time and energy to producing software that meets a particular need;
* second, to the open source businesses whose business model depends
upon the continued flourishing of the development project; and
* third, to the colleges and universities considering investing in an
open source solution by deploying it to meet some aspect of their ICT needs.

       METADATA TOOLS for DIGITAL RESOURCE REPOSITORIES WORKSHOP
                              AT JCDL 2006


This is an open call to participate in the Metadata Tools for Digital
Resource Repositories Workshop on June 15, 2006 at JCDL:  2006 (Joint
Conference on Digital Libraries:  http://www.jcdl2006.org/), in
Chapel Hill, NC, USA.

Metadata tools are vital for DLs and digital resource repository growth.
Sharable ontologies and metadata schemas supporting a wide range of
functions have helped initiate tool development. Project demands and
deadlines have made it difficult for tool developers, from different
digital initiatives, to share their progress.  Opportunity is also limited
for tool users to learn about applications and interact with developers,
distributors, and other consumers of metadata tools.  A venue is needed
for sharing developments, knowledge, and evaluation methodologies specific
to DL metadata tools.

This one day workshop will facilitate dialog among people interested in
metadata tools including, but not limited to, tool developers, companies,
and users.  The workshop has three components:

    1.  Presentations of application design challenges and solutions.

    2.  A tools exhibition.

    3.  A discussion on application evaluation and improving
        communication within the metadata tool community.

Workshop overview, objectives, and a tentative schedule can be found at:
http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/JCDL_Tools_WS_1.pdf

The workshop is an official DCMI Tools Working Group
( http://dublincore.org/groups/tools/ ) event.

The call is open for general workshop attendance. We are also seeking
participants who plan to exhibit their tools in Part 2, Tools Exhibition.

We request that all participants partake in the entire one-day workshop,
including Part 3, Breakout Groups and Discussion.

Workshop logistics:

    Date:  Thursday, June 15, 2006

    Time:  8:30 a.m. -- 5:00 p.m.

    Location:  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Room location to
    be determined)

Registration cost: JCDL or DCMI Members: $140.00; Non-members: $200.00;
    Student Members: $95.00; Student Non-members: $120.00;
    Other: (to-be-determined)

Registration is limited. To reserve your place, email Jane Greenberg @
janeg@ils.unc.edu.  Formal registration will be open on the JCDL Website
shortly.

Workshop Co-Chairs:   Jane Greenberg, Associate Professor and Director,
    Metadata Research Center, School of Information and Library Science,
    University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, (janeg AT ils.unc.edu), and
