<PRE>Hi:

I've no idea who's responsible for the OAI Data Provider registry [1]. I
wondered if anybody here knew anything about it.

I have tried to register our OAI service at

    <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/oai/request">http://www.nature.com/oai/request</A>

using the registration page [2] and it validated and said a confirmation
mail would be sent to the server admin. (This was already last Friday.)
Unfortunately the server admin email we chose is our customer services
address (<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/mailman/listinfo/oai-implementers">feedback at nature.com</A>) and so far they have not been able to locate
any email from the registration process.

I have tried mailing direct to the contact address
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/mailman/listinfo/oai-implementers">openarchives at openarchives.org</A> but have got no reply.

Any info on how to complete the registration process would be very helpful
as we'd like to get our service publicly registered.

Cheers,

Tony
