I think database errors and such are simply outside of OAI-PMH. If your
database is not working then you do not have an OAI server. HTTP provides
appropriate error codes (say 503 Service Unavailable) and you may include
a text message with such a return which will help with debugging. You can
also return a Retry-After with some long interval (say 1 day) in the hope
that the repository operator will fix the problem in time for an
intelligent harvester to try again.

Cheers,
Simeon.
