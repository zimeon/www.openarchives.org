If the repository implementation is simpler by always including a resumption
token element, and it doesn't cause a problem with the protocol, then it
should be ok to do this?

I came up with the same solution. But I wouldn't class this as &quot;trivial&quot;, as
the logic intersects with other aspects of the protocol (below...).

&gt;<i> &gt; 2) no-records+resumption token
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An empty list won't validate, e.g. ListRecords without any records.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is possible that flow control may result in an incomplete list that
</I>does
&gt;<i> &gt; not contain any records, e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Harvester requests (until=2002-03-04)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Performs flow control, gets to last page-1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Records on last page move out of result set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Harvester requests final token, for which no records can be returned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An empty token by itself will not validate, and &quot;noRecordsMatch&quot; means
</I>that
&gt;<i> &gt; no records could be returned for the query, not for the resumption
</I>token.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Change schema or return noRecordsMatch?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this would seem to be covered in section 3.5.1:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [...] In cases where there are substantial changes to the repository, it
</I>&gt;<i> may be appropriate for a repository to return a badResumptionToken error,
</I>&gt;<i> signaling that the harvester should restart the list request sequence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if you have a resumptionToken *and* no records match, then something ugly
</I>&gt;<i> did happen:  either the harvester is trying to &quot;forge&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> resumptionTokens, or the repository had (potentially significant) changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think returning both noRecordsMatch and badResumptionToken would be the
</I>&gt;<i> safe way to handle it.
</I>
Ok. This is kinda &quot;overloading&quot; errors though. An error hasn't occurred - a
change occurred in the repository that resulted in an empty list.

noRecordsMatch is defined as resulting from the original query, not as a
side-effect of flow-control, and the resumption token in question is valid?

So logic is now:

if( no records ) {
    if( CGI resumption token ) {
        add noRecordsMatch (&quot;no records match resumption token&quot;)
        add badResumptionToken (&quot;because it doesn't match any records&quot;)
    } else {
        add noRecordsMatch
    }
} else if( no resumption Token ) {
    add empty token
}

All the best,
Tim.
