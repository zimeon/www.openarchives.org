Hi Alan,

The repository explorer (thanks Hussein!) lists repositories in versions
1.0,1.1, and 2.0. That list isn't checked (?) so some of those base URLs may
be updated/missing, but is a good starting point for developers.
Otherwise I'm working on producing an OAI 2.0 mirror of every OAI repository
there is ...

I would be interested to know why you think versioning has been addressed?
For two agents to talk together in an any-version world there has to be a
consistent method for getting the protocol version, regardless of the actual
version implemented. While the version is wrapped up in an OAI Identify
response it's likely to &quot;jump around&quot; within the XML between versions.
Assuming the element will always be &quot;protocolVersion&quot; a node search could be
performed, but there's nothing to stop a repository putting a
&quot;protocolVersion&quot; element inside a description.

Which is why I look at the top level element's namespace, which should be
more reliable than a protocolVersion anyway (certainly I've forgotten to
&quot;roll-over&quot; the version number before, but the XML won't validate unless the
namespace is correct).

All the best,
Tim.
