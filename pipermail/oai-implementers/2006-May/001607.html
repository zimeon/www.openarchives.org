I'm not sure I understand your question properly. However, I think it 
would be reasonable to assume that any repository that exposes only day 
granularity datestamps is not updated more frequently than daily. I'd poll 
at most once a day (for which you specify a 'from' parameter equal to the 
previous day -- one increment of overlap is necessary to ensure nothing is 
missed).

(As an aside, it is amazing to see how many RSS clients poll arXiv.org 
very frequently when we do include the standard headers saying that we 
update daily and give a time. One might have hoped that these headers 
would increase efficiency but that does not seem to be playing out in 
practice.)
