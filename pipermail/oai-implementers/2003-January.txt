Michael Day of UKOLN has a nice page [1] that lists various metadata mappings. 
It mentions a TEI/MARC/DC mapping that was done by the Oxford Text Archive. 
It's not XSLT, but it's a start.

Thanks for the reply, but which dublin core standard does the above link
follow?  Only a few of the elements listed there look familiar.  
Just as reference, I'm using http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd 
and http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/dc/current-elements/ for my DC info.

Hello Jiann,

Jody Deridder from University of Tennessee at Knoxville - one of member 
digital libraries, has written a set of scripts to translates files encoded in 
TEI-lite to OAI 2.0 compliant unqualified Dublin core.

These scripts can be used to capture the unqualified Dublin core (UDC) 
metadata from TEI-lite files. Thereafter the UDC can be used to set up a Data 
provider using either of the tools described in sections 2.1 and 2.2 of my 
article.

Look at

Perhaps the OTA page is out of date now (c2000). It seems to be using 
qualifiers. I should refrain from saying more since I haven't worked directly 
with this mapping before.

Message-ID: <11e701c2b739$c5497620$14414e98@Shrek>

(in reply to earlier posts on problems with Perl & UTF8)

Perl 5.8 has much improved support for unicode, including the ability to
"convert" from one mapping to another, e.g.

#!/usr/bin/perl

binmode(STDIN, ":encoding(latin1)");
binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8");

while(<>) {
    print $_;
}

__END__

Will read in latin1, and output in UTF-8.

It also checks that what you output is in UTF-8 - any non-UTF-8 data
generates warnings.

(See the core Encode module for how to convert abitrary strings.)

All the best,
Tim Brody

Hi everybody.

Just wanted to be sure that these errors are expected.
I am just testing a new repository with the repository explorer.
The test ist successful except these bits where the verb, an argument or a
date is invalid.
In these cases the answer is "XML validation failed".
I believe this the expected behaviour because the <request> tag contains
these invalid values.

Am I right?

Cheers,
Marin

Hi Marin,  I don't  think so.  All responses should be valid XML whether 
it is a response to an incorrect parameter or not.  The repository 
explorer is expecting a certain valid XML response even when it submits 
erroneous parameters.  If you would like, send the baseURL of your 
repository and I could take a quick look at the responses.

Kind regards,
    Tom Habing

Tom,

thanks for your reply. You are right. I went through the protocol spec one
more time
and discovered it:

"In cases where the request that generated this response resulted in a
badVerb or badArgument error condition, the repository must return the base URL of
the protocol request only. Attributes must not be provided in these cases."

Most of the times it's just a matter of careful reading...

Marin

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Celestial Update & Repository Errors
Message-ID: <00e401c2c09b$3ebf8d40$14414e98@Shrek>

Dear all,

I've been working on improving Celestial, and as part of this have set to
harvesting the new OAI 2 registered repositories (n.b. just moved machines,
so the DNS may take a while to update):
http://celestial.eprints.org/cgi-bin/status

(red means either not harvested yet or the baseURL is wrong in the Identify
response)

Onto possible repository errors. These are all with a caveat that the
problem may be at my end - if you notice this please email me and I will
attempt to rectify as soon as possible.

1) Repositories not supporting the yyyy-mm-dd date format. I believe a
repository must support yyyy-mm-dd, even if it also supports the higher
resolution yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ (see protocol 2.7.1)

2) Quite a few repositories appear to have Unicode errors

3) Returning an HTTP 400 error when returning OAI errors. An OAI error is a
valid HTTP response, so should be 200 (perhaps 3.1.2.2 could make this more
clear?)?

4) Poor performance leading to timeouts (my own citebase is terrible ... )

5) Incorrect baseURL in Identify response - as a harvester I use the baseURL
returned by Identify to make sure I'm harvesting from the right location

As ever, feedback, comments, flames welcome ...

All the best,
Tim Brody

Hi all,

I've started harvesting OAI-PMH version 1.x repositories (so that they are
accessible to OAI 2.0 harvesters):
http://celestial.eprints.org/cgi-bin/status

If you have a repository (version 1.0, 1.1, or 2.0) and you're interested in
having it mirrored/gatewayed please email me with your baseURL.

I hope repo. admins don't mind me posting problems I've found here -
otherwise it would involve a lot of individual correspondance for fairly
common problems!

The following repositories appear to have XML character errors that prevent
parsing (according to Perl 5.8.0 XML::Parser):
217.21.43.5.ELibBSU
aim25.ac.uk
archives.anlc.uaf.edu.anlc

The following repositories are not supporting yyyy-mm-dd format requests:

The following repositories appear to be broken (error on OAI requests):
cds.cern.ch

Misc:
etdindividuals.dlib.vt.edu.ETDIndividuals appears not to accept a resumption
token it returned
perseus.tufts.edu is responding with HTTP 400 errors for OAI-level errors
(should be HTTP 200 for all OAI responses)

xtcat.oclc.org seems to be very slow, may be a problem my end (big

News from the Library of Congress for harvesters
================================================

1.  ListSets (on our version 2.0 harvester) will now retrieve set
descriptions.  These descriptions use the simple Dublin Core schema and
provide Title, Description, Type, Coverage, and Subject elements.  Where
appropriate, a Relation element links to the home page for the relevant
collection in American Memory.  Feedback is welcome.

2.  Version 1 service to be withdrawn March 1, 2003

Some months ago, we gave notice that we would be withdrawing our version 1
data-provider services within a few months.  If anyone will be
inconvenienced by our dropping these services (1.0 and 1.1) at the end of
February, please let me [caar@loc.gov] know.

If you are still using our version 1 harvester, you are already missing
two sets of records for photographs (Ansel Adams' 1943 photographs of the
Manzanar Relocation Camp; Panoramic Photographs).  

  Coming soon:  More photograph collections; an icon for LC branding

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
NETWORKING MULTIMEDIA RESOURCES
3RD OPEN ARCHIVES FORUM WORKSHOP

The organizing committee is very pleased to announce the 3rd Open
Archives Forum Workshop, which
will be held in Berlin on 27-29th March, 2003. Registration is opened on
the Open Archives Forum
website (http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/).

The aim of the Berlin workshop is to explore which specific requirements
and demands ought to be
carefully weighed and considered before a digital media archive is made
available via the Internet.
Within this workshop we will discuss different approaches to network
media repositories, libraries,
archives and other information resources using the Open Archives
Initiative technical framework for
metadata harvesting.

The workshop will consist of both presentations given by invited
speakers and small group breakout
sessions where the participants can discuss key issues, such as:
*   Metadata for multimedia-objects
*   Demands for an Application profile for media archives
*   University services in this field
*   User needs/Usage conditions versus technical, legal, access issues
*   Cross searching distributed Internet information resources
*   Collaboration among different cultural heritage institutions /
Multi-Institutional ventures

A tutorial on the implementation of OAI-PMH will be held the day before
the workshop (on March 27th)
for those who are not familiar with this protocol. One of the workshop
speakers will be Herbert van
de Sompel (Cornell University) representing the Open Archives Initiative
(OAI) with an update of OAI
activities.

Who should attend
*   People from media service institutions, museums, digitization
projects and librarians who are
considering making their repositories of information available via the
Internet;
*   technical, research and project managers who are interested in
providing third party services
for interoperable open archives and libraries.
*   decision makers in the area of libraries, media centres and museums
looking for new strategic
opportunities to promote their organizations and working areas.

About the Open Archives Forum:

brings interested parties
together to build a community of interest, enable exchange of
information and establish a web-based
European information source for open archives. In addition, OA-Forum
undertakes comparative reviews
of technical and organisational issues. OA-Forum is funded as an
accompanying measure within the
Information Societies Technology (IST) Programme, a theme of the
European Union's Fifth Framework
Programme managed by the Information Society Directorate-General of the
European Commission.
