<PRE>OAI Metadata Harvesting Workshop at JCDL2003
--------------------------------------------

Call for participation
----------------------

This workshop will bring together people with Open Archives Initiative
(OAI) metadata harvesting experience to discuss problems, their
solutions, and to identify best practices. The focus will be on near- to
medium-term practical issues. Participants will have the opportunity to
discuss problems or raise issues that they have encountered and will
benefit from the shared experience of the other participants.

The workshop will combine and distill the OAI harvesting knowledge and
experience of the participants to detail 1) best practices and existing
solutions to particular harvesting problems; and 2) unresolved problems
and issues with current implementations, the specification, or
limitations of version 2.0 the OAI protocol for metadata harvesting
(OAI-PMH). The conclusions of the workshop will be disseminated to the
wider OAI community.

This will be a full-day workshop with an emphasis on discussion.  It
will be held on Saturday 31 May 2003 (the day after the main sessions of
the JCDL conference). Participation is open to those who have OAI
harvesting experience. Participants will be expected describe their OAI
harvesting experience in a brief (1 or 2 paragraph) position statement,
and to propose a topic or topics for discussion.  Selected participants
will be invited to present a short paper to describe and seed discussion
on a topic they proposed.

Participants must register though the JCDL registration system. For
further information please see:
