</I>Hi Jiann-Ming,

We at the UIUC have developed a mapping of EAD to OAI both for the 
collection level and for the subordinate component levels.  You can find an 
XSLT that implements that mapping at 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uilib-ead/.">http://sourceforge.net/projects/uilib-ead/.</A>  Chris Prom and I also presented 
a paper on the subject which can be found at 
<A HREF="http://dli.grainger.uiuc.edu/publications/jcdl2002/p14-prom.pdf">http://dli.grainger.uiuc.edu/publications/jcdl2002/p14-prom.pdf</A>

Chris is also actively engaged on additional research on this subject; some 
of which can be found at <A HREF="http://web.library.uiuc.edu/ahx/workpap/">http://web.library.uiuc.edu/ahx/workpap/</A>

Regarding ZMARCO, of which I am the author: unfortunately we have not been 
able to get it to work with Voyager, at least not our Voyager implementation 
at UIUC.  This is primarily because of a limit of 10,000 records per result 
set that Voyager has.  If you wanted to mess with the ZMARCO code you might 
be able to get it to work.  However, we have not been very successful in 
porting ZMARCO to other Z39.50 servers.  At one point we did have it 
experimentally working with the UIUC's old DRA system (and some other DRA 
systems), but alas we are no longer running DRA at UIUC.

If you would like to correspond regarding ideas for getting ZMARCO to work, 
I would be happy to exchange ideas.  We still have a research project here 
in which we are exploring interoperability issues between Z39.50 and OAI.

Kind regards,
	Tom
