Subject: [OAI-implementers] Different tagging styles in oai pmh 2.0 w/o namespaceprefix
Message-ID: <3FFC5218.10606@smail.uni-koeln.de>

Hello ,

i just recognized, that theere is apparently no agreement about whether to include the namespace 
prefix in the metadata or not.
i added two records using differents tagging.
will there be a decision on further versions of the protocol?

Hello,

parsing records with the commons digester works pretty fine, set you are not handling special 
charactars such as german umlaute, french accents etc.

if found a hint at:

http://www.mail-archive.com/oxf-users@orbeon.com/msg00297.html which is not suitable for harvester

shouldn't the providers be aware of the right character encoding?

in the archive i found a hint, which recommends to change the encoding to ISO-8859-1,
but , of course, this does not help if done at digestion time.

Any suggestions?

Subject: [OAI-implementers] info URI scheme update
Message-ID: <4006D318.3050008@lanl.gov>

<Apologies for cross-posting>

NISO-Sponsored INFO URI Scheme is Information Gateway to the Web Publishing and 
Library Communities Join Forces to Facilitate and Expedite Representation of 
Standard Identifiers such as Library of Congress Control Numbers on the Web.

Bethesda, MD - January 14, 2004 - Working under the auspices of the National 
Information Standards Organization (NISO), a joint task force of the publishing 
and library communities has developed and published a Uniform Resource 
Identifier (URI) scheme aimed at the identification of information assets. 
Information assets should be interpreted rather broadly to include, for example, 
documents and terms from classification schemes.  The INFO URI scheme is a 
consistent and reliable way to represent and reference such standard identifiers 
as Dewey Decimal Classifications on the Web so that these identifiers can be 
"read" and understood by Web applications.  Led by four NISO members and 
associates-Los Alamos National Laboratory, Online Computer Library Center 
(OCLC), Elsevier, and Manifest Solutions-the initiative builds on earlier 
consultations with representatives from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and 
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). An Internet-Draft for the INFO URI 
scheme was first published Sept. 25th, 2003 and a revision published Dec. 5th, 2003
(see <http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vandesompel-info-uri-01.txt>.

Herbert Van de Sompel, Digital Library Research & Prototyping at the Los Alamos 
National Laboratory's Research Library, stated, "A good example of the problem 
that the INFO URI scheme solves involves PubMed identifiers: unique numbers 
assigned to records in the PubMed database maintained by the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) of the National Library of Medicine.  PubMed 
identifiers originated prior to the Web, so they are not URIs. As such they do 
not exist naturally in the Web infrastructure because the Web only recognizes 
URIs as a means to identify information resources.  So Web applications cannot 
use PubMed identifiers, and hence cannot reference PubMed records that are 
identified by them.  The solution is to turn PubMed identifiers into URIs.  The 
INFO Registry enables the registration of public namespaces of standard 
identifiers; NCBI registered its PubMed identifier namespace under the INFO 
Registry-their namespace is pmid-so we can now talk about the record with the 
PubMed identifier '12376099' in URI terms as <info:pmid/12376099."

"The goal of INFO is to act as a bridging mechanism to the Web by providing a 
lightweight means for registering public namespaces used for the identification 
of information assets," said Tony Hammond, Advanced Technology Group at 
Elsevier, a world-leading publisher of scientific, technical and medical 
information products and services.  "We see INFO as an enabling technology for 
the library, publishing and media communities-a way to facilitate and speed the 
growth of the Web as a truly global information place beyond a basic document 
repository. The Library of Congress, the National Library of Medicine, and NASA 
are among those organizations that have already registered public namespaces 
with the INFO Registry."

"There are different ways to represent these identifiers on the Web," explained 
Pat Harris, NISO's Executive Director, "but the INFO URI scheme really 
simplifies matters. As a Web user, you aren't likely to see the scheme in action 
on your screen-for example, <info:lccn/2002022641, because it's an 
under-the-hood way of communicating the identity of an information asset to a 
Web application."

The INFO Registry is now available online at <http://info-uri.info/> for 
receiving new registrations. This Registry contains all the information needed 
by Web applications to make use of INFO namespaces. Each Registry entry defines 
the namespace, the syntax, and normalization rules for the representing INFO 
identifiers as URIs, and gives full contact information for the namespace 
authority for that entry. Moreover, the INFO Registry is readable by both humans 
and machines alike.

For more information about the INFO URI scheme, see the FAQ at
<http://info-uri.info/registry/docs/misc/faq.html> .

Hi Thomas,

 From the perspective of a namespace compliant XML parser, the prefix which 
is used is not significant; the URI to which the prefix is bound is what is 
significant.  For example:

<title xmlns="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TEST</title>

<dc:title xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TEST</dc:title>

<dubc:title xmlns:dubc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">TEST</dubc:title>

All of the above should be treated identically; therefore, I doubt if there 
will be any changes to the OAI spec to clarify.

I will say that I have run into practical problems when trying to ingest 
prefixed or not prefixed xml records into different database systems. 
However, I consider this to be a problem with the database, not with the XML 
records or the OAI specification.

Hope this helps,
	Thomas

Hallo Thomas,

thanks for your fast reply. right at the moment i received a mail from the xerces mailing list, that 
reminds a java peculiarity:

snip

It seems that the jvm was asigning the local default encoding to any file it opened (in the entity 
resolver), and by specifying the desired encoding in the InputStreamReader the problem goes away.

in otherwords I changed:

	   InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(
            SimulationPanel.class.getResourceAsStream(sys));

to

            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(
            SimulationPanel.class.getResourceAsStream(sys),"UTF8");


snap

why my postings come with that delay ? no idea.

Message-ID: <FB4F95390166B14C90E4DD950D69D6E21A815D@EXCHVS2.cs.cornell.edu>

Hi all,

So, I was looking at what it would take to get Fedora's OAI provider interface to support sets for selective harvesting and I realized that communicating set membership changes to harvesters could be trouble.

Is there a sane way to deal with this?  The only thing I can think of is to just  treat the set membership change as a record modification, but this leaves certain harvesters in the dark.  They will believe the record still exists in its prior set forever and hasn't been modified forever, unless:

  They are smart enough to recognize a setSpec change in a header, and
     a) They are lucky enough be selectively harvesting 
        on one of the new sets the record is in, or
     b) They only do incremental (not set-selective) harvesting.

-or-  

  They periodically dump everything and do a full harvest.

If I know up front that set membership is apt to change, should I:

  1) Not support sets in my provider.

  2) Support sets, but have a policy that if someone is harvesting
     from me, they agree to either:
       i)  periodically dump everything and do a full harvest, or
       ii) never do set-selective harvesting

  3) Something else

Any recommendations or opinions on this?

Thanks,
Chris

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Requesting a part of a record possible with OAI-OMH?

Message-ID: <400D25CC.7030309@zuma-mannheim.de>

Is it possible to offer/request only a part of a record with OAI-PMH?

For example: exists a way to request only the "dc:title" of an identifier?

I browsed the open archives web site and found only the verb 
"GetRecord". In addition to offer or request a whole record, we would 
like to offer or request only one element of a XML document stored in a 
record.

Background:
Requesting a whole record with DC information is no problem. But we are 
thinking about using OAI-PMH to offer DDI-structured information on 
social science surveys. DDI is an extensive description format (in XML) 
with ca. 300 elements on surveys (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/DDI/). For 
some scenarios it would be more effective to offer/request only one 
element or one element group of the xml document.

Joachim,

One way would be to create a second format for the title-only version of
the record.  You would need to have a separate metadataPrefix, at a
minimum.  It would be good practice to have a separate XML schema that
only allows the fields you want, and have the second format use that
schema.

Achim,

I could probably add this feature to the ERRoL service for you without much
trouble (http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/oairesolver/). The URL you
could use would look something like this:

"http://errol.oclc.org/" + <oai-identifier> + "." + <metadataPrefix> +
"?xpath=" + <xpath expression>

If the repository doesn't use the oai-identifier scheme, the URL would look
like this:

"http://errol.oclc.org/" + <repository-identifier> + "/" + <identifier> +
"." + <metadataPrefix> + "?xpath=" + <xpath expression>

The response would be the corresponding XML fragment from the record.

Let me know if you're interested and I can add it to the list of ERRoL
features.

hi Joachim

no, i do not believe this can be done with OAI-PMH. at the risk of going 
off on a tangent, let me suggest some solutions ...

maybe what you need is an "extension" or "semantic overload" or a new 
protocol altogether. now, a number of us have played around with 
interesting ways to extend OAI-PMH and we have learnt important lessons, 
many of which may be obvious, but i will try to list anyway:

firstly, look for existing protocols. i dont know any off the top of my 
head but maybe someone else does. search protocols probably wont do the 
trick because it sounds like you want to transfer a specific part of 
each record in the full set.

if you cannot find an existing protocol, do NOT then overload/extend the 
meaning of OAI-PMH! instead, design a completely separate protocol if 
you need to. generally, it is not a good idea to muddy the waters with 
different versions of OAI-PMH, especially if you intend to interoperate 
with other people (what you do wholly within your system is of course a 
different matter).

for example, you could define a small specification called "Part 
Extraction Protocol (PEP?)" as follows:
-- ListRecordParts returns the metadata similarly to OAI-PMH but with 
additional parameters that specify (maybe using XPath) subtrees of the 
metadata records (noting that there will be validation issues)
-- GetRecordPart does the same but with a single record

there is no rule that states a single repository should support only one 
protocol - your repository can then support OAI-PMH on one baseURL and 
"PEP" on another, in just the same way as some current repositories 
support OAI-PMH on one baseURL and SRW on another (for searching).

lastly, adopt current best practices and standards as defined by the OAI 
and Web community. what this means is:
- don't use a different style of record encoding if people already 
understand the OAI style ... i.e., header/metadata/etc
- think about SOAP - it is now a standard so there is no reason why new 
protocols should not use it and there are some benefits to it (like a 
large community of practice)
- be RESTful ... keep the simple things simple

this sounds complicated, but i think we need to get beyond basic 
OAI-PMH. real services need more interesting protocols for components to 
interact and metadata harvesting only gives you, well, whole chunks of 
harvested metadata :)

by now you have probably stopped reading this message, but if not, i 
have one last suggestion: how about an "other_protocol" description 
format for OAI-PMH Identify responses? does anyone else think it will be 
useful to know what other protocols can be used to interact with a data 
collection? for example, OCLC's ETD collection could list:

<description>
    <protocol:protocol xmlns:protocol="..." xmlns:dc="...">
       <dc:title>SRW</dc:title>
       <dc:identifier xsi:type="dcterms:URI">
          http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/srw/specifications.html
       </dc:identifier>
       <dc:coverage xsi:type="protocol:version">1.0</dc:coverage>
       <protocol:baseURL>
          http://alcme.oclc.org/srw/search/NDL/SearchRetrieveService
       </protocol:baseURL>
    </protocol:protocol>
</description>

could this possibly be useful for discovery/advertising of services? it 
is somewhat halfway between "friends" and WSDL and might already be done 
- anyone have pointers? or thoughts in general?

ttfn,

Achim,

as you've now realized, "there's more than one way to do it" (tm).

my opinion:

1.  if all you ever want is "title" and maybe 2-3 other fields, take
Naomi's suggestion and offer those a "mini" metadataPrefix's.  this places
the burden of filtering your metadata file on the data provider.

2a.  if you don't always know which field you want, and could possibly ask
for any of the 300+, then creating a couple of light-weight
metadataPrefixs is not the solution.  You could use an existing
service like ERRoL to do the stripping, as per Jeff's suggestion.

2b. if you don't want to depend on an external service (for either
technical or management reasons), you could construct your own service
that generally extracts paths from metadata records.  I think this is
Hussein's suggestion.

I see these options in increasing weight.  Not knowing any more about your
application that what you described, I would seriously consider #1 before
moving to #2a or #2b.

regards,

Michael

this is a great idea and deserves its own thread...

for example, I've been meaning to add SRW to http://ntrs.nasa.gov/ in my
spare time.  Assuming that ever happens, it sure would be handy to "point"
to other protocol interfaces.

now all we need to do is come up with a pithy name for the description
container.  "otherProtocols" is kind of bland.  "associates"?
"colleagues"?  "family"?

I like this idea too. Specifically, I'm thinking I could use this
information in association with the ERRoL service. Using the SRW/SRU example
Hussein gave, I could place a button for it somewhere on the OAI Viewer page
for the NDLTD repository (http://errol.oclc.org/ndltd.oclc.org.html). In
fact, there could be a whole column of buttons for the various services
specified in the repository's Identify response. 

I could also use this information to configure the ERRoL service. For
example, the look and feel of the OAI Viewer for individual repositories
could be customized by specifying a different XSL stylesheet in a
description element.

Another example is that I am writing a service to allow people to create and
edit XML records in arbitrary XML Schemas. I don't want to enable this for
all repositories, so individual repositories could add a description element
for it along with the email address of the administrator where record adds
and changes can be sent.

I was thinking of using custom description schemas to define these things
for the ERRoL service, but if there is a commonly accepted mechanism, all
the better.

The JISC Information Environment Service Registry Pilot Project (cor
blimey, that's a bit of a mouthful! :-) ) is developing an experimental
registry of the collections and services that make up the UK higher
education information landscape.  See

  http://www.mimas.ac.uk/iesr/

for details.  As part of this work, the project has developed an
'application profile' for describing various kinds of services, including
Z, SRW, SOAP, CGI, RSS, OAI-PMH, etc.

I'm not sure how easy you'll find it to work your way thru the pages, but
the application profile and some examples are linked from:

  http://www.mimas.ac.uk/iesr/metadata/

You'll note that for SOAP-based services like SRW, the 'service'
descriptions link to an external WSDL file, rather than re-inventing the
wheel.

hi Andy

it looks most interesting ... here are some thoughts:

- your descriptions are for an independent external registry, while i 
was proposing a "friends"-like services offered on the same archive. as 
such, "title" would be a moot point, while you (rightly) require it.

- your service identifiers are assigned by a central authority - with a 
self-description, that should not be necessary (and may even violate 
some information independence principles)

- you do not have a formal identifier for the protocol and i think that 
is quite important to match clients and servers for services. i was 
suggesting the canonical URI of the protocol specification. if someone 
comes up with a new CGI-based protocol, they SHOULD have a specification 
written down somewhere, otherwise i don't see the point of advertising 
the interface publicly.

- WSDL is tricky. did you use the draft spec or the technical note? 
there are encoding differences between the two, so until this becomes a 
standard, i am keeping my distance.

- access rights may be useful. administrator may be covered already (by 
adminEmail). contributor is again not relevant in this case, but i see 
that that is optional anyway so it doesnt matter.

so ... do you think these differing requirements can be merged? (im 
still not sure where/how i will use this yet, but at least a few other 
seem interested as well).

Sorry about the late answer.

Thank you very much for all your comments and the summary, your input 
helped me very much.

Here is the summary from my perspective:

I understand, that the actual version of OAI-PMH can request a whole 
record (XML document), but not a part of record (a fragment of XML 
document).

The proposal from Naomi (1) is a workaround, which will work if it's 
only necessary to request only a few defined parts of a record.

Jeffs proposal (2a) has the attractive idea to request a part of a 
record by the means of XPATH. In my eye's it's a drawback to depend on a 
external service for the reason, that the "main" protocol (OAI-PMH) is 
lacking this feature (nothing against external services). I would like 
to think more about a general solution (for DDI). But nevertheless, 
Jeff, thank you very much for your offer.

Hussein's proposal (2b) of a new protocol on top of or parallel to 
OAI-PMH sounds very good. The proposed way to add this new protocol 
seems to be very flexible also for other new protocols, it would be a 
way of a general extensibility of OAI-PMH. The question seems to me: is 
  "requesting a part of record" not a candidate of a new version of 
OAI-PMH? "GetRecordPart" and "ListRecordParts" were the tools I'm 
looking for.

The actual version of OAI-PMH has the intention of requesting whole 
records (primary use of harvesting protocol). The question of requesting 
a part of a record by the means of XPATH will arise with large XML 
documents. The service provider could be interested only in a part of 
the information. Large XML documents have usually DTDs/Schemas with a 
deeply nested structure and a lot of elements or have repeatable 
elements which could be repeated very often.

The size of DDI files reach often 500-1000 KB. The description of a 
social survey consists often in several hundred questions/variables and 
in an extensive general study description.

I see one problem with the idea to request fragments of a XML document 
stored in a record: the client would not be able to validate the 
response, because its only a fragment of a XML document. A better 
solution would be to embed the fragment in a frame of a valid XML 
document (like a "condensed version" of a XML document). That would be 
dependent from the XML DTD/schema (the question would be, which elements 
are required).

Right now we are just thinking about using OAI-PMH to offer DDI-files. 
Perhaps there is another way to offer XML files for service providers, 
Hussein mentioned SOAP.

I will try to give the DDI community 
(http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/DDI/users/listserv.html) a hint on this 
discussion thread.

Yes, I don't think Andy was proposing a separate external service a la
JISC IESR (which I should add is still very much just at the pilot
stage!), but rather suggesting that the "service description" that might
be embedded in the OAI-PMH Identify response might be kept to a very
minimal DC-based record that included a pointer to richer details
provided using existing specs/standards.

I should add that (as an occasional but not terribly prompt or timely
adviser to the IESR project) I have an outstanding action against me to
explore some of the elements of that service description schema to see
whether some of the "proprietary" aspects might be represented using
WSDL.

Well, except in so far as they are drawn from the controlled list here

http://www.mimas.ac.uk/iesr/profile/vocabs/#AccMthdList

in which each of those values could be assigned a URI. But at the
moment, you're right, I don't think they are, and I agree it would be
better to use global "canonical" URIs for the protocols. Those URIs
might or might not be the URL of a human-readable spec though.

My memory of the WSDL specs is a bit hazy, but I think they use XML
QNames (rather than URIs) to identify/reference what they call
"bindings"?

I'd pretty much agree with that, I think.

Ah... not sure! I'd have to check! ;-)

Hi All,

It is good to see some interest in our IESR service metadata 
descriptions. But I think I should point out that it is still very much 
'work in progress' - and our documentation is probably not perfect! 
Currently the main effort is going into getting a prototype of the 
registry working.

Also, as Andy said, it is being developed within a specific domain 
of UK HE. That said it would be good to receive comments and 
work with people outside that domain. We 'invented' the IESR-
specific metadata properties because there did not seem to be any 
standard, or generally accepted, metadata for our purpose, as far 
as we were aware. The metadata uses standard or standardish 
metadata where possible.

Very brief description of the data within the registry: The main 
purpose is to describe collections that are funded by JISC for use 
by researchers, learners, teachers in UK higher and further 
education, and probably in the future other collections of use to 
them. And to describe services, ie low-level machine access 
points, that provide access to those collections. But we also want 
to describe services that are not collection-based (that we have 
termed 'transactional'). The most significant examples of these are 
OpenURL resolvers (without getting into philosophical discussions 
about 'what is a collection', etc!). So we have 2 types of entity to 
describe: collection and service. We also have agents that can be 
owners of collections and/or administrators of services but they are 
not of much interest. 

The collections are described mostly by RSLP Collection 
Description - hopefully will be migrating towards DCMI Collection 
when that is more agreed.

For the services we found we had to invent some metadata 
properties. Most significant is 'iesr:interface' that gives m2m details 
about how to acess the service. As Andy said, we didn't want to 
reinvent the wheel, so we have used standards where possible. So 
we use WSDL for SOAP services and Zeerex for Z39.50, SRW, 
etc. OAI-PMH doesn't need an interface description - potential 
users can interrogate the service itself. The only ones we couldn't 
describe like this are general web-cgi services. At the moment we 
are creating a proprietary 'keys' file to describe these - with the 
'interface' property pointing ot it. But, as Pete said, we intend to 
look for a more standard way of describing these.

Eventually we will have an XML schema to describe the metadata 
formally (we have only a DTD at present, that being a requirement 
for the software platform). And we intend to provide an OAI-PMH 
interface to allow harvesting of the records.

We needed unique URIs for the entities in the registry and there did 
not appear to be any already in existence at the time when we 
designed this. Though some collections may have URIs and we 
would expect to use those rather than assigning a new identifier.

This is probably a failure in the documentation. The names we use 
oai-pmh, webcgi, z3950, are just tokens and I agree they should be 
defined by URIs. I expect that finally the definitions of the IESR 
controlled vocabularies will be held within a IESR meta-registry, 
that also knows about IESR entitiy identifiers and their 
relationships. I would intend to improve their definitions at that point.

This is probably true. However we have to deal pragmatically with 
reality :)

>From some work we've done to discover requirements from our 
stakeholders (data suppliers and eventual users), there is a clear 
requirement to describe SOAP services. However, there don't yet 
appear to be many actual services to describe. So this is really 
looking to the future and we haven't delved too deeply into WSDL 
yet. Also the WSDL is defined by the metadata (and hence 
service) providers, not by us.

For other service protocols, eg RSS, Z39.50, OpenURL, we have 
include a metadata property 'supportsStandard' that allows for 
description of the particular versions and profiles a service 
supports. I would expect to augment this list with WSDL versions 
in the future.

These properties are more to do with the domain in which the IESR 
operates, and to provide information to humans.

Today OAI-PMH is successfully transporting millions of (albeit small) 
records, which is GBs of XML data. A possible refinement of your system 
would be to provide oai_dc records for your DDI records, using 
<identifier> to point to the full record. I wouldn't have a problem with 
serving or downloading 1000s of multi-megabyte files from an HTTP 
server, but if they were embedded into a CGI XML response it would be 
very slow and cumbersome.

Putting your DDI XML records onto an XSLT-aware Web server would also 
allow you to construct XSLT's to perform the kind of partial-record 
retrieval you are looking at.

All the best,
Tim Brody

hi

just wanted to reply to one specific issue - where you ask if two new 
"Part" verbs should not be considered for a new OAI-PMH version.

the current OAI-PMH is very popular largely because lots of prospective 
features were thrown out (during development of the protocol) to keep 
things simple - thus making implementation easier, faster and more accurate.

the principle adopted was that PMH transfers data - raw data - and thats 
it. anything more interesting than raw data transfer should be viewed as 
a different "value-added" service provided by a repository or service 
provider. in all likelihood, if there ever is a newer version of PMH, it 
will still do only raw data transfer :)

i should also add that Tim's solution (DC records to describe data, with 
pointers to actual data) is something we implemented at VT a few years 
ago for data similar to yours (large files of XML-encoded numerical data).

ttfn,
----hussein

I would second Hussein's response on question of way GetRecordPart, etc.
aren't incorporated into OAI-PMH.

Keep in mind that OAI-PMH originated as a very targeted protocol
designed as a way for eprint archives to share descriptive (typically
bibliographic) metadata. The intent was to keep it simple and keep it
very low-barrier for metadata providers. Many current providers are
using OAI metadata provider implementations that would not be all that
robust when it comes to handling, for instance, the processing of XPath
requests. There are in fact a few OAI metadata providers that don't make
use of an XML parser for any of the dynamic parts of the service (e.g.,
the necessary XML processing is done elsewhere in batch mode).  I think
there's a large segment of the current OAI community that doesn't want
to discourage current and would-be implementers by imposing additional
requirements beyond those already in the protocol which were seen as
(and largely have proven to be) the minimal for its original, and still
primary purpose -- in fact a recommendation was introduced not all that
long ago (the OAI Static Repository) which actually further lowers
barriers for original small-site metadata providers.

Instead the OAI model assumes higher-level service providers will do the
heavy lifting -- which is why I would most favor Jeff Young's approach.
Special purpose third-party services are intrinsic to the OAI model and
I personally would like to see continued further development in this
regard (as opposed to changes in the protocol itself).

Alternatively of course we could see a separate, distinct protocol for
data exchange emerge which is related to or even a superset of OAI-PMH
(think new protocol might be to OAI-PMH as XML is to HTML). Hussein and
others have advocated for and made progress in this direction, and that
would also be a good way to go.

But in brief this is why in my opinion features like GetRecordPart, etc.
weren't and should never be incorporated into OAI-PMH. Someday OAI-PMH
will outlive its usefulness, in the meantime, let's make sure it
continues to meet original purpose and objectives. Tacking on new
features and functionalities will lessen its value to current core
users.

Or if you are truely perverse, you merge the two and squeeze the XPATH
expression (or a URL to an XSLT stylesheet) into the metadataPrefix

Hussein and Tim,

thank you for clarifying this point.
Perhaps this should become a entry in the FAQ.

Hi,

I'm a volunteer with The Linux Documentation Project <www.tldp.org>. We
currently host in the range of 200 books and articles about Linux. Many of
which are used in classrooms as textbooks, and by system administrators,
regular people, etc. :) In some cases the LDP documents are actually the
official documentation for specific open source projects. The documents 
are stored in either DocBook XML, DocBook SGML or LinuxDoc (which is SGML).
The LDP publishes PS, text, HTML and PDF versions of the documents --
the source XML/SGML files are also available to anyone who would like them.

I think it would make sense for the LDP to submit its repository to the
OAI. The first step will be to get our meta-data in order (and make sure
all of the documents validate, which they /should/). The following is the
proposed list of elements (from the DocBook DTD) which will be required
for all publications:

- title
- authorgroup or author (or authorcorp for organizations)
- pubdate in the format of YYYY-MM-DD (ISO standard for dates)
- revhistory including at least one revision with: 
	<revision>
	<revnumber></revnumber>
	<date></date>
	<authorinitials></authorinitials>
	<revremark></revremark>
	</revision>
- legalnotice and/or license (License is REQUIRED and must be one of GDFL,
  Creative Commons, or LDP License)
- email where the author can be reached.
- abstract
- copyright notice
- acknowledgements (optional)
- other credits (optional)
- disclaimer (optional)

What other meta-data information would we need to provide? I'm assuming
most of this can be paired up to the DublinCore, but I'm not sure if I'm
missing any other requirements for the DublinCore. 

Also, would we have a harvester crawl the site, or would we provide a
single XML file with a summary of all the docs in the collection?

Thanks!
emma

OAI-PMH is primarily a 'discovery' protocol. It isn't necessary (or perhaps
desirable) to export your full-texts within the OAI-PMH framework.

The usual use of OAI-PMH is to provide metadata records that point to the
full resource (for Dublin Core use dc.identifier). You can provide the
full-text as a parallel metadata format, but I would suggest providing a DC
service to begin with, and if there is demand provide access to the
full-text.

OAI-PMH requires some kind of CGI script to serve the XML data, in response
to URI queries. There are tools available in PHP, Java, Perl, Python from
the Web site - http://www.openarchives.org/. An alternative is to use
'oai-static', which is a single XML file containing all of the data normally
associated with OAI-PMH which might be more appropriate to the LDP - but I'm
not sure how much support there is out there for static repositories.

All the best,
Tim Brody

hi Emma

and let me add that if you can write an XSLT stylesheet (or any other 
translation program/script) to translate one of your source XML files to 
one or more metadata formats (including Dublin Core), the XMLFile data 
provider tool will make the collection of XML files look like an 
OAI-PMH-compliant archive with minimal effort (meaning, no programming) 
... like everything else, it is linked in on the OAI website.

most people stumble across this package on their own, but i just thought 
i would hint at it since there is even a new version in the pipeline...

ttfn,
----hussein

 digester : UTF8 and xerces UTFDataFormatException

Thomas,

Sounds like the XML you are trying to parse is simply broken and you 
should therefore contact the data provider to get them to fix the problem.
If the XML declaration starts by declaring UTF-8 encoding: 
  <?xml ...  encoding="UTF-8"?>
then the data must be correctly encoded as UTF-8.

The hint you quote refers to editing XML files and does not apply to OAI
data providers as the OAI protocol mandates UTF-8 (see: 
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#XMLResponse)

I just tried harvesting from the registered baseURL for Sammelpunkt
(http://sammelpunkt.philo.at:8080/perl/oai2) and got a 500 error so there
seem to be some problems.

Cheers,
Simeon
