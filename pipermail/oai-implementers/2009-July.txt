Hi,

We have a vendor provided system with an OAI-PMH interface. When issuing
a ListRecords command, it returns (edited for brevity):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

<OAI-PMH xmlns="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/OAI-PMH.xsd">
   
   <responseDate>2009-07-20T21:05:43Z</responseDate>

   <request verb="ListRecords" metadataPrefix="oai_dc" set="SET1">
       http://www.example.com/oai
   </request>
   
   <ListRecords>

      <record>
         <header>
            <identifier>oai:record:1</identifier>
            <datestamp>2009-06-30T11:29:18Z</datestamp>
            <setSpec>SET1</setSpec>
         </header>

         <metadata>
            <record
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
               <dc:title>Title</dc:title>
               <dc:creator>Creator</dc:creator>
               <dc:description>Description </dc:description>
               ...
            </record>
         </metadata>

      </ListRecords>

   </record>

</OAI-PMH>

To me this looks invalid - the <record> element within the metadata is
not expected to be there (a <record> is defined as being the top level
of a record, and thus contains a header and metadata). Most OAI-PMH
interfaces I have seen put an <oai_dc:dc> wrapper around the metadata.

The http://www.validome.org/ validator backs this up, and reports that:

Invalid content found starting with element 'record'. One of
'{WC[##other:"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/"]}' is expected

However our vendor is sure that this valid output, and when we checked
it, the site passed the OAI-PMH registration validation system OK.

Any advice appreciated! :)

Stuart,

Here's the short version: you're correct and your vendor is wrong.  The 
inner <record> in the example below should be <oai_dc:dc> as you correctly 
surmised in your email.

Regardless of what the validators say, tell them a quick inspection of:

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#Record
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#ListRecords

should make the intent clear.

regards,

Michael

Hi Stuart,

this is no valid response. See:
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#ListRecords
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#Record
and
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#OAIPMHschema

Did you try http://re.cs.uct.ac.za/? It usefull in order to test one's 
OAI data provider prior to registration.

Sunny Greetings

The response is not delivering the promised metadata format. "record" is 
the root tag of the metadata, according to the OAI/PMH definition. This 
means that the provider is delivering metadata in a format which isn't 
Dublin Core or any other standard metadata format, in spite of the cd 
elements within the root element. But the request specifies 
metadataPrefix="oai_dc", so the response is expected to deliver Dublin 
Core. Any client that issues a request for DC metadata and gets that 
response will be unable to cope with it.

Message-ID: <AE19ECAB747B564A8A85AB6339545570C78067@ITS-EXC2.UR.Rochester.edu>

Greetings,

We are building an application which can have multiple OAI repositories
accessible through the same Java Servelet, and are looking for a way to
differentiate between them.  Our current thought is to pass a GET
parameter in the URL to the Servelet indicating which OAI repository to
access, but I wanted to confirm that this wouldn't get mixed up in the
OAI parameters and thus result in invalid repositories.  Our plan would
result in URLs similar to the following  for two distinct OAI
repositories:

http://www.domain.com/oai?id=1
http://www.domain.com/oai?id=2

Requests to these repositories would then look like this:

http://www.domain.com/oai?id=1&verb=identify
http://www.domain.com/oai?id=2&verb=identify

Is this valid?

Thanks,
   Eric Osisek

Eric,

Strictly speaking, you should not have extra arguments like:

http://www.domain.com/oai?id=1&verb=identify
http://www.domain.com/oai?id=2&verb=identify

Some clients & servers might let you get away with doing that, but not all 
will.  And you'll appear to have 1 baseURL instead of 2.

It is pretty easy to use something like mod_rewrite 
(http://www.modrewrite.com/) to expose the above urls as:

http://www.domain.com/oai/repo1/?verb=identify
http://www.domain.com/oai/repo2/?verb=identify

this way you have 2 distinct baseURLs and none of the external OAI tools 
get confused, but you could still have 1 script that handles everything.

regards,

Michael

I can't see anything in the OAI-PMH spec that excludes URL parameters 
other than those which the protocol knows about, but some clients might 
have trouble providing such URLs.

Is there a reason why you don't want to treat these as sets?

I think the intention was that addition arguments are not
permitted. The badArgument error condition is described thus:

"badArgument -- The request includes illegal arguments, is missing
required arguments, includes a repeated argument, or values for
arguments have an illegal syntax."

[http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#ErrorConditions]

Simeon

Hi Eric,

I'll be tackling this same issue very soon. My initial thoughts are 1)
sets, as already suggested and 2) do something like:

http://www.domain.com/repo1/oai
http://www.domain.com/repo2/oai

I think with url mapping that could work. And the url could be used to
limit the user's results. (e.g. The set list could be limited to only
return the sets in "his" repository).

Thanks to everyone who responded. The vendor has now adjusted the xsl
that generates the records, and the oai_dc element is now being
generated as required.

The response is not delivering the promised metadata format. "record" is

the root tag of the metadata, according to the OAI/PMH definition. This 
means that the provider is delivering metadata in a format which isn't 
Dublin Core or any other standard metadata format, in spite of the cd 
elements within the root element. But the request specifies 
metadataPrefix="oai_dc", so the response is expected to deliver Dublin 
Core. Any client that issues a request for DC metadata and gets that 
response will be unable to cope with it.

This may be a stupid question, but does anyone know of a list of tools used

Hi Kat,

I'm not aware of any lists and you're probably already familiar with these 'lists', but as a starting point:

There's the handout on OAI tools from Metascholar (2005) - http://blog.lib.umn.edu/silvi003/codenotes//OAIToolsFinal.pdf
Though it predates ARC from ODU (2006) http://oaiarc.sourceforge.net/

http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/tools/tools.php lists some harvesters among the repository software listed (this amalgamated list may be the best current list but it's dated in 2006 as well).

Hopefully someone knows of a more current list.

Of possible interest though:
the repinf wiki / International Repositories Infrastructure wiki has lists of harvesters:
http://repinf.pbworks.com/Harvesters+-+national+and+international
http://repinf.pbworks.com/Harvesters+-+subject-+or+discipline-based

depending on what sort of information you're looking for - working back from these could give an indication of what's in use and how much people are growing their own software.

Cheers,
john

Hi,
We developed in last winter this tools : "MonCarnet 2.0" (in english : 
MyNotebook 2.0) available on the french academic tools forge : 
http://sourcesup.cru.fr/projects/mc2/ (in french too, but to download 
clic on "t?l?chargement"). Our PHP/MySQL tool, harvests OAI-PMH 
repositories for storage m?tadata, open accounts for users.

Best,

St?phane.

Hello Robert and St?phane,

Thank you for this-- I had forgotten about the International Repositories
wiki, until you reminded me. I'm guessing most folks out there roll their
own currently, as each aggregator needs records for different reasons.

I will pass this along,
Many thanks,

  I use Tim Brody's HTTP::OAI modules Perl. I am very happy with it.
  There is also Ed Summers Net::OAI::Harvester module.

Hi!

REPOX is a framework developed by the IST (the engineering school of the
Lisbon Technical University, in Portugal) in the scope of European initiatives
TEL and Europeana, to manage large numbers of data providers and the
respective harvestings. It already is in production among several TEL data
providers all over the Europe (in this moment it is mainly focused in
requirements from TEL), but we are continuously releasing new versions, so we
might be able to also address other new relevant features...
Details at:

http://repox.ist.utl.pt/

Any specific questions can be addressed to Diogo Reis
(diogo.menareis@ist.utl.pt)

Best Regards
Jos? Borbinha

Hi Kat,

We also have a Tomcat-based harvester for scheduling multiple harvests 
which can be embedded into other applications. See 
http://www.apsr.edu.au/software.htm#harvester_package

Hi Kat,

I'm sure you are aware of our Windows-based OAI Harvester.  It is 
getting a bit dated being implemented as an ActiveX DLL plus a family of 
VBScripts, but its been working well for us for many years.  If you or 
anyone else on the list is interested I can share more info.  Our open 
source code on SourceForge is also outdated, so if there is any interest 
I can post an updated release.

Kind regards,
Tom

Hi Kat,
We have adaptation of OCLC harvester which harvests in XML files any type of
data and subsets. We are using it for collecting AGRIS data.
You can find more at ftp://ext-ftp.fao.org/GI/Data/GILW/stefka/harvester/

All,

This may be a stupid question, but does anyone know of a list of tools used
to harvest OAI metadata? I know of ours
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/umoaitoolkit/>, naturally, but I wasn't able
to come up with others by perusing the obvious web sites. Even if there's no
list, I'd be interested in individual suggestions.

Thanks,
 -Kat
