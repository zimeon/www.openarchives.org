hi

i suppose this is a question of interpretation.

the spec says "noRecordsMatch- The combination of the values of the 
from, until , and set arguments results in an empty list"

now, if from>until and both are independently legal dates, then in a 
set-theoretic sense the combination of these parameters results in an 
empty set. thus, the re expects to find "noRecordsMatch".

does this make sense ? or should i be accepting both errors (the other 
being badArgument) ?

ttfn,
----hussein

cc: oai-implementors: if anyone does not agree with this interpretation, 
now would be a good time to mention it :)

Well, I still maintain that zero matches should not be an error.
Its just a response with zero matches. But that is probably too late now.

Regarding should from>until be a badArgument or noRecordsMatch, or
both, if the spec does not mandate one or the other, both errors
make complete sense to me.

Ummm...  So if a set name (or whatever) simply doesn't pass the
pattern-matching test, it should get "cannotDisseminateFormat"?  Or could
possibly have 2 error conditions, one of "which is badArgument"?
I'm finding that in parsing through a resumption token, I could have quite
a few errors for a single resumption token (of course all
"badResumptionToken"--- and a set of dates can get hairy too).

 So are these the general rules (?) :

1) any number of errors per verb/argument (could be several "badArguments")

2) list all parameters in the "<request ... " tag if no badVerb or
         badArgument errors (Hussein, below)

3) leave them out otherwise

4) "badArgument" is a "catch-all" to use if nothing else fits;  consider
        all other error codes first; if another is applicable it must be
        used

Comments?  Rebuttals?  Free-for-alls?

In the protocol, "repositories should report all errors or exceptions that
arise from processing the request". IMO, it's fine to respond a
"badArgument"+"noRecordsMatch" if a set name doesn't pass the
pattern-matching test.

The protocol said  "repositories should report all errors or
exceptions that arise from processing the request"

Yes, see 3.2 in OAI-PMH

The only scenario I can think about is an unrecognized set (as mentioned
by Hussein). I am not sure it's a general rule that "badArgument" is a
"catch-all" to use if nothing else fits.

In another thing, I guess the re and other harvesters can be lenient
in  some situtations;-) For example, a repository which has strict
format requirement for set may return "badArgument" to a request with 
bad sets format; another repository which doesn't have any pre-defined
format  for sets may return "noRecordsMatch". 

let me know if I am wrong.

I would say it should be noRecordsMatch.

from > until is odd, but not incorrect.

Set logic:

{>=from} AND {<=until} = {result set | empty set}

Message-ID: <3CFE222F.67D6F075@lanl.gov>

hi all,

I would like to draw your attention to an interesting development that
is likely to impact certain OAI-PMH implementations.

As can be seen from the attached press release, the Library of Congress
has just announced an XML Schema for MARC 21 records.  As this will be
an authoritative Schema for MARC21 records, we will include it as a
recommendation in the Implementation Guidelines that come with OAI-PMH
v.2.0.

Also, as a result of communications we had with the Library of Congress,
a conversion stylesheet is being provided that supports
transformation/migration from oai_marc to MARCXML.  It is available at
http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/.  I would like to thank the
Library of Congress for providing this tool, recognizing the importance
of the installed base of OAI-PMH applications that have adopted
oai_marc.

greetings

Library of Congress announces standard MARCXML schema

The Library of Congress Network Development and MARC Standards Office
announces completion of a schema for MARC 21 records in an XML structure
for use in communicating MARC 21 records.  It is available from http:
www.loc.gov/marcxml.   This schema was developed in collaboration with
OCLC and RLG and reviewed by the National Library of Canada and the
National Library of Medicine (NLM), after a survey of schemas in use in
various projects.  Many schemas have taken the Aslim@ approach but all
vary slightly.  This schema will be maintained by the Library of
Congress as will software that enables lossless conversion to and from
MARC 21 records in the ISO 2709 structure.  As illustrated in the
introductory information on the web site, the Library of Congress will
develop and provide, downloadable from the MARCXML web site, tools for
various transformations and for record validations.  A single schema
serves all the five MARC 21 formats.

By collaboratively developing a communications schema, the Library of
Congress encourages the standardization of MARC 21 exchange records in
the XML environment, recognizing that  MARC 21 records inside systems
will continue to use different record configurations, tailored to the
characteristics of the system.  Provision of the tools for
transformations to and from other metadata approaches, such as Dublin
Core and the Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS), will help to
standardize derivative metadata records also.  (MODS is a new schema for
a bibliographic element set that is a subset of MARC expressed in XML
with language-based rather than numeric tags.)  The tools take the
mappings between MARC and other metadata sets, that have been maintained
on the MARC web site, to an operational level.

One project interested in a standard, lossless MARCXML schema is the
Open Archive Initiative (OAI) which found it necessary to draft a schema
in the absence of an official one.  The Library of Congress worked with
the OAI to provide a transformation from the original oai_marc schema to
this one so the Initiative can take advantage of a schema that is
maintained by the MARC 21 maintenance agency and in broad use.  The
transformation is available from the MARCXML web site.

With the slim approach, schema-driven validation is only possible at the
highest structural level.  The Network Development and MARC Standards
Office will therefore maintain downloadable tag, subfield, and value
validation software on the web site that will enable users to build
validation programs for their needs.  Use of these standard validations
represent another attempt to assure standardization of records to
support effective record interchange.

The Library has maintained two SGML DTDs (for Bibliographic-type and
Authority-type records) since 1996, which take a different approach to
the data elements in MARC B an approach that enables validation of data
through the DTD itself but requires a very large DTD and DTD
maintenance.  The Bibliographic-type DTD was converted to an XML DTD in
2000.  These DTDs have been effectively used by some agencies (including
the Library of Congress), primarily for internal processes, therefore
transformations between them and the new slim MARCXML schema are being
provided.  Maintenance techniques and/or possible revision of the XML
DTDs are under consideration.

For questions or comments please email the Office at ndmso@loc.gov.

Hi

I wanted to let you know that I have updated the myOAI search interface and
added the following features:

- Added a recommender system which suggest other documents perhaps worth
looking at based on prior search and retrieval patterns of other users.

- Changed the way in which databases are selected, now they are displayed
as a list rather than databases with checkboxes, this is to accommodate
their growing numbers.

- Added the ability to run a meta-search, displaying the total number of
results  per database before displaying the search results, the user can
then pick  which database(s) they want to see results for.

- Added the ability to group the search results by database, the user can
then pick which database(s) they want to see results for.

- Added documents viewed to the search history, now you can see both your
previous searches and all the document you viewed in reverse chronological
order.


You can get to the myOAI web site at the following URL:

    http://www.myoai.com/

I also have a Perl based harvester which is OAI V2 compliant and would be
happy to put it up on the web site for download if there is interest. I will
warn you now that it is pretty simple, but it is effective.

Please feel free to send me feature requests, feedback, comments,
criticisms, etc...

François

Message-ID: <sd061ab4.060@loc.gov>

Apologies for cross-posting, FYI,

There is an OAI-PMH v.2.0-beta compliant data provider for the Library
of Congress OAI repository at (base url):

http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/oai2_0

This new data provider contains an implementation of the new MARC21 xml
schema that Herbert mentioned in a previous email. I used
metadataPrefix=lc_marc21 for this format for now. The functionality of
this data provider has been validated with the openarchives.org registry
validator (though not registered since the repository Id is in use with
our v1.1 implementaion). I also got successful results from the "Test
and Add" link in the Repository Explorer. 

Thanks, please let me know if you find any problems with this
implementation.

There are several websites that have XSDs for DC in RDF etc. but they

If there is not one yet, who would be the right person to convince to do

Stuart,

Indeed there is not yet a xml schema for qualified DC.  Encouraged by the success of (finally) producing a schema for unqualified Dublin Core (the one referenced in the OAI-PMH v2 specification at http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/simpledc20020312.xsd) a number of us in the DC and OAI community are in the midst of producing such a schema.  The timetable is for a solid proposal middle of next month with closure on the process by October.

Hi Carl,

I would be _very_ interested in a DCQ schema that included the DC Citation
work (dc.identifier.citation refinement).

I've been playing around with the DC cite concepts:
http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/oai?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=dcq&id
entifier=oai:arXiv:hep-th/0102001

(pretend its properly schema'd and '_' is ':')

I would like to expose a "standard" format (which isn't marc) to allow
others to use Citebase bibliographic data, and DCQ+DC Citation would seem to
be ideal for this purpose.

Do you have a timescale for producing a DCQ schema?

All the best,
Tim B.

Tim,

An excellent idea but... The DC Citation work has not yet been 
endorsed by the DCMI, so it will not be part of the DCQ schema.

The current proposal by the DCMI Citation Working Group was just 
for a Dublin Core Structured Value (DCSV) which contained the 
sub-elements for citation. So it is really just a literal string for the 
element value, which could be parsed if you know how. Even this 
has not yet been agreed on as a DCMI recommendation, mainly 
because they haven't yet made a decision on DCSVs.

The DC Citation WG work plan includes the definition of a 'DC-Cite' 
application profile, which I think would translate into an XML 
schema. But moving this forward was waiting on the endorsement 
of the above DCSV (perhaps there is no need to wait). 

I would very much like to see a DC-Citation schema used by the 
OAI community. But until this moves forward in DC, it would be a 
'local' profile.

Best wishes,
	Ann

  I agree that agreement in desparately needed in this area, not

  Tim,  Simeon and I have been working on a 'local' profile 
  called AMF. I am using it in the RePEc OAI gateway I am working 
  on. Probabably a good way forward for us is to wait
  until a draft of the dcq schema file is out and examine how
  it can be extended.

hi all,

regarding the citations discussion:

I think this is a point where some OAI, DCMI and OpenURL work could converge, and
hence I feel that it would be good to have some thorough discussion about this.

I would like to remind you of the work Andy Powell has done in using OpenURL's as
citation formats (see http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue27/metadata/).  Given the
status of OpenURL when Andy wrote the paper, I did not feel confident about
promoting the suggested approach.  However, given the way in which OpenURL
evolves in the context of its NISO standardization, I definitely think the line
of thought introduced by Andy deserves some very close attention.

Elements supporting this line of thought include:
- the mere fact of OpenURL becoming a standard;
- the extensibility mechanism that is being built in, that allows for its
adoption for a wide variety of "material" types;
- the fact that it can be used to cite not only the "thing" but also the context
in which the "thing" appears;
- the idea to do work on an OpenURI (say an OpenURL without BASE-URL);
- the notion of the context-object (see Bison-Fute paper -
http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july01/vandesompel/07vandesompel.html) underlying the
new version of OpenURL, which includes the possibility of  "rendering" a citation
of "thing" and context in different ways, i.e not only as name-value pairs;
- the fact that OpenURL can build on identifiers of whichever namespace.

Instead of pointing you at the technical details of the upcoming OpenURL, I
invite you to look at some examples at
http://lib-www.lanl.gov/~herbertv/niso/OpenURL-BNF-examples-v7.htm .  And please
remind that encoding would not necessarily have to be name=value.

many greetings

herbert

Message-ID: <706871B20764CD449DB0E8E3D81C4D4301F2C81F@opus.cs.cornell.edu>

Interesting discussions from all.  As Herbert points out in another mail, this is an opportunity for some interesting cooperative work.  I think we all agree that 'citation-type' metadata is useful.  Tim's example at http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/oai?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=dcq&identifier=oai:arXiv:hep-th/0102001 demonstrates how one might make available for harvesting not only the citation data for a resource but its list of references.  

My personal perspective is that trying to shoehorn these requirments into the DC element structure is probably the wrong approach.  It relies on a notion of DC Structured Values, the status of which is pretty uncertain with in DCMI and for which there is no well-defined data model. It also seems to take the approach of DC as a root format on which to build further expressive structrues, rather than as one metadata format among many. Wouldn't a better approach be to exploit the reality we now have realized in OAI: that is, availability of multiple parallel metadata formats?  SHouldn't citation and reference metadata be packaged as a metadata format parallel to DC (qualified or unqualified)?  Sure there is some duplication of information with DC (e.g., yes a citation has a title) but, taking the view that the metadata format exposed for harvesting is just a database view, I don't think that this is really a relevant argument.

So, a proposal.  Let's move this reference/citations metadata requirement out from under the notion of 'application profile' for DC or qualifiers for DC and see if there can be some agreement on a good XML schema (profile) for making this information harvestable via OAI-PMH.  

Probably if people like Tim and Ann put there heads together on this, possibly with the contributions of Simeon Warner and Thomas Krickel, we could come up with something that could fit into a revised version of the OAI implementation guidelines document.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) available for
 trial use
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.21.0206131710560.18776-100000@sun8.loc.gov>

Announcement: Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) available for trial
use

The Library of Congress' Network Development and MARC Standards Office,
with interested experts, has developed the Metadata Object Description
Schema (MODS) , which is a bibliographic element set that may be used for a
variety of purposes, particularly for library applications.  Information
about MODS and the schema (version 1.2) is available at:
http://www.loc.gov/mods

As an XML schema it is intended to be able to carry selected data from
existing MARC 21 records as well as to enable the creation of original
resource description records. It includes a subset of MARC fields and uses
language-based tags rather than numeric ones, in some cases regrouping
elements from the MARC 21 bibliographic format. The elements inherit MARC
semantics, so are more compatible with existing library data than other
metadata schemes.

MODS could potentially be used as follows:
* as a Z39.50 Next Generation specified format
* as an extension schema to METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission
Standard)
* to represent metadata for harvesting
* for original resource description in XML syntax (using MARC
semantics)
* for representing a simplified MARC record in XML
* for metadata in XML that may be packaged with an electronic
resource

MODS includes a subset of data from the MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic
Data. As an element set that allows for the representation of data already
in MARC-based systems, it is intended to allow for the
conversion of core fields from a MARC 21 record, while some specific data
may be dropped. As an  element set for original resource description, it
allows for a simple record to be created, in some cases using more general
tags than those available in the MARC record.  The Library of Congress has
developed transformations to move MARC 21 records from 2709 form to
MARCXML to MODS, with the software available from the MARCXML Web site.

There has been wide review and input to the development of the schema,
which is now available for trial use.  It will remain stable for the next
six months, during which we invite comments as a result of experimentation.
 For questions or comments please email the Office at ndmso@loc.gov.

Open Archives Initiative Releases Version 2.0 of the Protocol for
Metadata Harvesting 


Ithaca, NY & Los Alamos NM-The Open Archives Initiative is pleased to
release version 2.0 of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for
Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). The release of OAI-PMH v.2.0 comes after
16 months of worldwide experimentation with version 1.x of the protocol,
an 8 month revision process by the OAI-tech group, and 4 months of
alpha/beta testing. Thanks to this rigid testing and revision, we feel
confident to release the OAI-PMH version 2.0 as a stable specification. 

A full copy of this press release with information about the features of
OAI-PMH version 2 is available at
http://www.openarchives.org/news/oaiv2press020614.html. 

The OAI-PMH version 2 specification is available at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm.

Message-ID: <E17KIVn-0000Q7-00@serenity.mcc.ac.uk>

Carl, Herbert,

I agree with Carl's proposal here. But I think that any XML schemas 
to cover citations should be based on the work Herbert is doing for 
OpenURL, rather than more of us cooking something up. Otherwise 
we would be in danger of duplicating effort again, and OpenURL is 
heading towards standardisation. Then we could include citation 
information within an openurl namespace in OAI-PMH, so we could 
have something like:

<dcterms:citation>
  <openurl:jtitle>Lecture Notes in Computer Science</openurl:jtitle>
  <openurl:atitle>Dublin Core Metadata for Electronic 
Journals</openurl:atitle>
  <openurl:aulast>Apps</openurl:aulast>
    etc
  <openurl:admin_ver>Z39.XX-NN</openurl:admin_ver>
</dcterms:citation>

or wrapped by <dcterms:references> for references [and making 
assumptions about dcterms:citation, otherwise wrapped by 
dc:identifier]

Herbert, please correct me if I have got this wrong! I assume we 
could use an OpenURL namspace before it becomes a 'real' 
standard. And that we can do this as part of OpenURL version 1.0 
(because it would not have a resolver).

If we utilise an OpenURL schema, we can immediately do citations 
for more than just journal articles, such as conference papers, 
books and parts, patents, etc.

I think it would still need some agreement with DCMI, that the 
OpenURL schema could be used within the particular DC 
elements, but hopefully this would be acceptable because it 
doesn't depend on a DC structured value. [However I do still 
advocate a DCSV for the literal string citation, being less cryptic 
than OpenURL for human reading, but that is outside the scope of 
OAI.]

Best wishes,
	Ann

hi all,

Let me try to summarize:

1. In the context of the OAI-PMH, it would make a lot of sense to treat
citations as a parallel metadata format.  The unqualified DC record describes
the "paper", whereas another record (under the same item) describes all the
citations made in the "paper".  That is what Carl suggested in his mail.  And
that is the approach that Stevan Harnad and I discussed at last year's
OAI-related conference in Geneva.  This approach makes sense in that it is
extensible: it allows other stuff related to the "paper" (for instance usage
logs, certification metadata, preservation metadata, etc.) to be treated in yet
other parallel records under the same item.

2. When it comes to choosing a "metadata format" to describe those citations,
looking at OpenURL makes a lot of sense.  Not only because it is becoming a
standard, but because its purpose really IS to describe stuff (read "citations"
in this context) by building on a broad range of identifier-namespaces and a
multitude of metadata formats.  Moreover, OpenURL allows not only for the
description of a "citation" but (optionally) also of entities that make up the
context in which the "citation" appears.  That is very significant when thinking
about the possibility of open linking at the level of OAI service providers.
And it is significant when thinking of using "OpenURL" as a parallel metadata
format, as it allows the citation to remain attached to the thing in which it is
cited.

Last weekend, I have been working on an XML encoding that I hope will find its
way into the OpenURL standard (I X my fingers).  The thing being encoded is the
context-object.  That is the thing described in the Bison-Fute paper
(http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july01/vandesompel/07vandesompel.html), that contains
descriptions of the "cited thing" (referent in OpenURL terminology), the
referring-entity (the thing in which the citation is made), the referrer (the
system that provides the description of the referent), etc.  Several
context-objects (read contextual descriptions of cited things) can be bundled in
a context-container.  that context-container might be the parallel metadata
format in which citations could be bundled for OAI-PMH.  the context-container
format is fomalized by means of an XML Schema at
http://lib-www.lanl.gov/~herbertv/niso/context-container.xsd (experimental!).

Let's take the following example:

The D-Lib Magazine paper:

(a) Van de Sompel, Herbert and Oren Beit-Arie. 2001. "Open Linking in the
Scholarly Information Environment Using the OpenURL Framework." D-Lib Magazine.
7(3). <http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march01/vandesompel/03vandesompel.html> <doi
10.1045/march2001-vandesompel>

Cites:

(b) Caplan, Priscilla and Arms, William Y. 1999. Reference Linking for Journal
Articles. D-Lib Magazine. 5(7/8).
<http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july99/caplan/07caplan.html> <doi
10.1045/july99-caplan>

(c) Van de Sompel, Herbert and Hochstenbach, Patrick. 1999b. Reference Linking
in a Hybrid Library Environment. Part 2:SFX, a Generic
  Linking Solution. D-Lib Magazine. 5(4).
<http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april99/van_de_sompel/04van_de_sompel-pt2.html> <doi
10.1045/april99-van_de_sompel-pt2>

In OpenURL terminology:
- paper (b) is a referent
- paper (c) is a referent
- paper (a) is a referring-entity (it references a and b)
- D-Lib Magazine is the referrer, as in this example it provides the "OpenURL"

Using the context-container encoding, the above citations could be rendered as
follows:

hi all,
<p>Let me try to summarize:
<p>1. In the context of the OAI-PMH, it would make a lot of sense to treat
citations as a parallel metadata format.&nbsp; The unqualified DC record
describes the "paper", whereas another record (under the same item) describes
all the citations made in the "paper".&nbsp; That is what Carl suggested
in his mail.&nbsp; And that is the approach that Stevan Harnad and I discussed
at last year's OAI-related conference in Geneva.&nbsp; This approach makes
sense in that it is extensible: it allows other stuff related to the "paper"
(for instance usage logs, certification metadata, preservation metadata,
etc.) to be treated in yet other parallel records under the same item.
<p>2. When it comes to choosing a "metadata format" to describe those citations,
looking at OpenURL makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; Not only because it is becoming
a standard, but because its purpose really IS to describe stuff (read "citations"
in this context) by building on a broad range of identifier-namespaces
and a multitude of metadata formats.&nbsp; Moreover, OpenURL allows not
only for the description of a "citation" but (optionally) also of entities
that make up the context in which the "citation" appears.&nbsp; That is
very significant when thinking about the possibility of open linking at
the level of OAI service providers.&nbsp; And it is significant when thinking
of using "OpenURL" as a parallel metadata format, as it allows the citation
to remain attached to the thing in which it is cited.
<p>Last weekend, I have been working on an XML encoding that I hope will
find its way into the OpenURL standard (I X my fingers).&nbsp; The thing
being encoded is the context-object.&nbsp; That is the thing described
in the Bison-Fute paper (<A HREF="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july01/vandesompel/07vandesompel.html">http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july01/vandesompel/07vandesompel.html</A>),
that contains descriptions of the "cited thing" (referent in OpenURL terminology),
the referring-entity (the thing in which the citation is made), the referrer
(the system that provides the description of the referent), etc.&nbsp;
Several context-objects (read contextual descriptions of cited things)
can be bundled in a context-container.&nbsp; that context-container might
be the parallel metadata format in which citations could be bundled for
OAI-PMH.&nbsp; the context-container format is fomalized by means of an
XML Schema at <A HREF="http://lib-www.lanl.gov/~herbertv/niso/context-container.xsd">http://lib-www.lanl.gov/~herbertv/niso/context-container.xsd</A>
(experimental!).
<p>Let's take the following example:
<p>The D-Lib Magazine paper:
<p>(a) Van de Sompel, Herbert and Oren Beit-Arie. 2001. "Open Linking in
the Scholarly Information Environment Using the OpenURL Framework." D-Lib
Magazine. 7(3). &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march01/vandesompel/03vandesompel.html">http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march01/vandesompel/03vandesompel.html</A>>
&lt;doi 10.1045/march2001-vandesompel>
<p>Cites:
<p>(b) Caplan, Priscilla and Arms, William Y. 1999. Reference Linking for
Journal Articles. D-Lib Magazine. 5(7/8). &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july99/caplan/07caplan.html">http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july99/caplan/07caplan.html</A>>
&lt;doi 10.1045/july99-caplan>
<p>(c) Van de Sompel, Herbert and Hochstenbach, Patrick. 1999b. Reference
Linking in a Hybrid Library Environment. Part 2:SFX, a Generic
<br>&nbsp; Linking Solution. D-Lib Magazine. 5(4). &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april99/van_de_sompel/04van_de_sompel-pt2.html">http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april99/van_de_sompel/04van_de_sompel-pt2.html</A>>
&lt;doi 10.1045/april99-van_de_sompel-pt2>
<p>In OpenURL terminology:
<br>- paper (b) is a referent
<br>- paper (c) is a referent
<br>- paper (a) is a referring-entity (it references a and b)
<br>- D-Lib Magazine is the referrer, as in this example it provides the
"OpenURL"
<p>Using the context-container encoding, the above citations could be rendered
as follows:

<p>I agree with Carl's proposal here. But I think that any XML schemas

<br>OpenURL, rather than more of us cooking something up. Otherwise
<br>we would be in danger of duplicating effort again, and OpenURL is
<br>heading towards standardisation. Then we could include citation
<br>information within an openurl namespace in OAI-PMH, so we could

<p>Herbert, please correct me if I have got this wrong! I assume we
<br>could use an OpenURL namspace before it becomes a 'real'
<br>standard. And that we can do this as part of OpenURL version 1.0
<br>(because it would not have a resolver).
<p>If we utilise an OpenURL schema, we can immediately do citations
<br>for more than just journal articles, such as conference papers,
<br>books and parts, patents, etc.
<p>I think it would still need some agreement with DCMI, that the
<br>OpenURL schema could be used within the particular DC
<br>elements, but hopefully this would be acceptable because it
<br>doesn't depend on a DC structured value. [However I do still
<br>advocate a DCSV for the literal string citation, being less cryptic
<br>than OpenURL for human reading, but that is outside the scope of
<br>OAI.]

I
<br>> think we all agree that 'citation-type' metadata is useful.&nbsp;
Tim's
<br>> example at
<br>> <a href="http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/oai?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=">http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/oai?verb=GetRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=</a>
<br>> dcq&amp;identifier=oai:arXiv:hep-th/0102001 demonstrates how one
might
<br>> make available for harvesting not only the citation data for a
<br>> resource but its list of references.
<br>>
<br>> My personal perspective is that trying to shoehorn these requirments
<br>> into the DC element structure is probably the wrong approach.&nbsp;
It
<br>> relies on a notion of DC Structured Values, the status of which is
<br>> pretty uncertain with in DCMI and for which there is no well-defined
<br>> data model. It also seems to take the approach of DC as a root format
<br>> on which to build further expressive structrues, rather than as one
<br>> metadata format among many. Wouldn't a better approach be to exploit
<br>> the reality we now have realized in OAI: that is, availability of
<br>> multiple parallel metadata formats?&nbsp; SHouldn't citation and
reference
<br>> metadata be packaged as a metadata format parallel to DC (qualified
or
<br>> unqualified)?&nbsp; Sure there is some duplication of information
with DC
<br>> (e.g., yes a citation has a title) but, taking the view that the
<br>> metadata format exposed for harvesting is just a database view, I
<br>> don't think that this is really a relevant argument.
<br>>
<br>> So, a proposal.&nbsp; Let's move this reference/citations metadata
<br>> requirement out from under the notion of 'application profile' for
DC
<br>> or qualifiers for DC and see if there can be some agreement on a
good
<br>> XML schema (profile) for making this information harvestable via
<br>> OAI-PMH.
<br>>
<br>> Probably if people like Tim and Ann put there heads together on this,
<br>> possibly with the contributions of Simeon Warner and Thomas Krickel,
<br>> we could come up with something that could fit into a revised version
<br>> of the OAI implementation guidelines document.

Message-ID: <20020619192023.G29453@io.mds.rmit.edu.au>

With 2.0 now hitting the streets, I guess I can start asking questions
here regarding 2.0...

We are trying here to harvest both from 1.0/1.1 and 2.0 repositories.
But we hit a slight snag which we can work around, but I am not sure in
my mind whether I should be bothered or not.

In 2.0, it says records should contain all XML namespace declarations
they need to use locally. Harvesting eldorado (which does not claim to
be 2.0), I get back a record that uses the global 'xsi' namespace
declaration for the xsi:schemaLocation of the record content.

In 2.0, I believe its mandated that the xsi namespace be redeclared
locally so you can pick up the record and have it parse independently
of the rest of the response. Is this correct?

I am tossing up in my mind whether its worth the effort of continuing
to support 1.0 and 1.1 by copying down required namespace declarations
from above etc. I can do it, its just messy. How important do people
think continued support for 1.0/1.1 is I wonder? How long before everyone
upgrades?

Opinions welcome!

Subject: [OAI-implementers] XSD file for qualified DC

Message-ID: <E17Kgpl-000Fkt-00@probity.mcc.ac.uk>

Herbert,


I agree entirely with your suggestion about using OpenURL as a 
parallel metadata format.


However, as the question which started this was about qualified 
DC, I would like to point out that there may be some confusion 
about the meaning of 'citation', especially about the DC-Citation 
stuff, which has also been referred to as connected with OpenURL 
by the Ariadne paper 
(http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue27/metadata/). A confusion which 
probably wasn't helped by my earlier email.


The term 'citation' is used to describe 2 similar but different things. 
It is easiest to desribe this for journal articles.


1. The bibliographic citation information (journal, issue, pagination) 
for an article as part of the metadata for the article itself. This is 
what publishers refer to as the header information for the article.


2. The citation information for papers cited by an article which are 
listed in the references section of the article.


The DC-Citation work is, so far, about (1). Maybe the choice of the 
term 'citation' was unfortunate, because everyone assumes it 
means (2), but it's difficult to think of a better word. This is why the 
encoding suggested for dc-citation is within a dc:identifier element, 
because of the recognition that the bibliographic citation can 
effectively identify the article. [This could obviously be extrapolated 
to (2) but would be within a dc:relation/dcterms:references element.]


The scenario you describe is for citation (2). Here the parallel 
metadata format within a context object you describe looks perfect. 
This is obviously a major OAI requirement, for initiatives such as 
Citebase.


But I think that citation (1) will also be needed as OAI is used for 
more than just eprints repositories. For instance, if you wanted to 
provide OAI records from an A+I database, or a journal article table 
of contents database, you would need to be able to detail the 
journal/issue information within each record. I could see this being 
of use for harvesting records for the latest journal issues available 
in such a service. I think you can still use the OpenURL metadata 
for this but that it would be 'nested' within the DC record, similar to 
the noddy example I previously wrote. At the moment we're still 
stuck with using unrecognised DC structured values in literal 
strings within simple DC to pass this information around. 


But at present, I think that the OAI priority is citations(2), and this 
current development looks really promising. Citations(1) will need 
more discussion within DC.


Best wishes,

	Ann

I guess one way is to use the Celestial (oaia) implemented by Tim Brody.

http://celestial.eprints.org

It harvests 1.x data providers, caches the data, and exposes them in
2.0's way.

So 2.0 applications can use Celestial to harvest 1.x compliant data
providers.

About standardizing citation sharing (I mean 'citation', not publication
information or article header info), CERN is on the point of releasing its
automated citations extractions in a way which I would like you to comment
about.

The citations are actually included within the record structure. Our
native format is MARC and we defined specific tags (in 999C5) to store the
different pieces of a citation that we can analyse.
See an example at
 <http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search?sysnb=0481511CITCIT>
and click on 'XML MARC' to see its structure.

I guess it is not optimum but I'd like to know (and I hope so) if you
think this approach can easily adapt to the futur standard 'parallel
approach' ?

Yours,
 JY.

From lagoze@cs.cornell.edu  Thu Jun 20 12:58:01 2002

Ann,

Thanks for the clarifications here.  Yes, I understand the overloading
of the term "citation".  My colleague Donna Bergmark here at Cornell in:

Bergmark, D. and Lagoze, C., "An Architecture for Automatic Reference
Linking," presented at 5th European Conference on Research and Advanced
Technology for Digital Libraries, Darmstadt, Germany, 2001, 

Was much more systematic in calling the in-links in the link graph
"citations" and the out links "references"; in that sense we should then
really talk about "citation data" as your category one below (the
bibliographic information for the resource itself) and "reference data"
as your category two below (bibliographic information for the resources
referenced by the resource).

Using this terminology I think we all agree that putting reference data
into Dublin Core is not right.  This is very much a "one-to-one"
violation in that it would involve putting metadata about another
resource into the metadata container of some source resource.  Thus,
there is a clear application of some parallel metadata form to expose
the reference data; probably following the openURL, bison-fute concepts
that Herbert has outlines.

Turning attention to the citation data issue, I will argue equally
strongly that slotting these into the dc identifier element is
inappropriate.  Citation data is implicitely structured whereas dc
elements should be simply "appropriate literals" as defined by Tom
Baker.  Playing a syntactic trick and serializing that data into an
"appropriate literal" through the use of punctuation such as "Library
and Information Science Research 22(3), 311-338 (2000)" as you suggest
in http://epub.mimas.ac.uk/DC/citproposal.html, seems ill-advised with
data that screams out for markup such as:

<citation>
	<journalTitle>Library and Information Science
Research</journalTitle>
	<journalVolume>22</journalVolume>
....
</citation>

Since this explicit structure is not currently allowed in DC (and I
question whether it ever should be) and given the fact that OAI-PMH is
quite happy expressing parallel structured form, it might be time to
write the schema for such citation data and encourage people to expose
it for harvesting, and not characterize it as "dublin core".

Message-ID: <46FBA84293DBD511989E00A0C9ED2F7114EB88@exchange01.exlibris-int.il>

I have a small suggestion concerning error reporting.

We have several error codes in OAI 2.0 protocol ("badArgument",
"badResumptionToke" etc).
If I understand correctly, if none of these error codes fits for an error
that should be reported, 
the OAI data provider should return HTTP Error code "503 Service
unavailable".
1. If the OAI data provider uses HTTP Error code 503 it cannot specify what
exactly has happened.
    And sometimes it's useful.
2. There are situations when the OAI Data provider wants to report a
specific error for a specific record.
    I think that sending HTTP Error code 503 in this case is too general.

Therefore I propose to add additional error "unspecifiedError" (as it's done
in Z39.50 protocol). 
In the "error" element content OAI data provider may specify the error.

hi Jean-Yves,

I have a few comments:

* The Library of Congress recently released an XML Schema for MARC21 records, which could be used in stead of
oai_marc.  As the Library of Congress definitely has more authorithy than the OAI when it comes to MARC
records, I would say that usage of their format is preferred from now on.  The LoC recognized that we did not
have an alternative in the OAI-world but to create our own schema before they released theirs, and as a
result they have been so kind to provide an XSLT to migrate records from oai_marc to LoC MARC21 XML format.
see http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-marcxml.htm

* The approach you have taken is the "all-in-one" as opposed to the "parallel" approach we have been
discussing on this list.  In doing so, some non-standard MARC stuff has been done.  As far as I can tell,
nothing in what you have done will prevent you from adhering to a "parallel" approach once a guideline for
such would be released, because the core of your work is the parsing out of individual information-entities
and tagging them appropriately. Using the markup that you currently have, it should be posibble to convert to
a "parallel" format of the kind I suggested.  As a matter of fact, if you would be interested, I am very
willing to explore this path with you.  Please feel free to contact me directly for further discussion.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] NASA LTRS techreports server now 2.0 compliant (testers welcome!)
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.10.10206201138050.11048-100000@pitfall.cs.odu.edu>


I have just completed upgrading NASA's LTRS techreports server to the new
OAI 2.0 Protocol.  Testers are welcome to give the system a try and I
welcome everyone's feedback.

My next project will be to upgrade the OAI implementation on NASA's NACA
techreports server as well, so again I welcome you LTRS feedback.

I have tried to format the error message content so they provide useful
details, rather than vague error messages.

-------------------------------------------------
You can try the LTRS techreports server at:

http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/oai2.0/
-------------------------------------------------

What I really like about the techreports servers is that they utilize
Bucket technology developed by Dr. Michael Nelson, to provide intelligent 
storage containers for our digital objects.

One of the added values here is that you may easily retrieve the OAI2.0
implementation source code. Here is an example of the format of such a
request: (BTW: code is in PERL)

-------------------------------------------------
Source code for a particular verb: (ie: Identify or your verb of choice)
http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/oai2.0/?method=list_source&target=Identify
-------------------------------------------------
Source code for LTRS specific implementation: (contains error handling, etc)
http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/oai2.0/?method=display&pkg_name=oai&element_name=oai.pl
-------------------------------------------------

So now you can get a peak at the code.  All feedback welcome.

Hi Carl et al,

The short answer is I disagree with you Carl, but please read on ...

[Parallel meta formats]

I would argue it is marginally beneficial to have both the relations
("reference data") and metadata ("citation data", or "context") in the same
record. In the same record it is the XML that defines the relation, in
parallel metadata formats it is the format (breaking the model of records
being self-contained).

Regardless, there will always need to be at least two metadata formats:
unqualified DC, and some "relatedto" aware format.

[Abstract view]

I'm interested in making links from A to B. To achieve that needs a
comparable thing contained in A that is also contained in B. The "thing" is
either a URI, a string, or structured data:

<a>
<relatedto>
    <identifier/>
    <unstructured_metadata_string/>
    <structured_metadata/>
</relatedto>
</a>

<b>
<identifier/>
<unstructured_metadata_string/>
<structured_metadata/>
</b>

Instantiating this in DC:

"dc:identifier is an unambiguous reference to a resource" - citations are
intended to be unambiguous references.
"dc:relation is a reference to a related resource" - I believe reference
data falls under this description.

So unqualified DC can contain all the data that I'm interested in, and can
be heuristically parsed later on (just as most OAI services do now with
dc.creator and dc.date, and I do now with dc:identifier).

The reason for exposing more structure than strings in OAI is so:

1) Structured source documents don't lose that structure (e.g. BMC XML
articles) and,
2) That Gateway services can provide structured data to downstream services
(e.g. Citebase, CERN)

As I understand DC qualifiers, they give greater structure without breaking
the principal of lowest-common denominator (i.e. remove all the
qualifications and its still understandable and actionable by a system that
talks DC):

<a_dc>
<dc:relation>Smith, John (1992) Functional Principles in Functions v5
44-50</dc:relation>
</a_dc>

Passed through a citation-aware gateway would produce:

<a_dcq>
<dcq:relation.references>
<dcterms:citation>Smith, John (1992) "Functional Principles in Functions" v5
44-50</dcterms:citation>
<dcq:identifier.citation>
<dc:creator>Smith, John</dc:creator>
<dc:date>1992</dc:date>
<dc:title>Functional Principles in Functions</dc:title>
<ja:volume>5</ja:volume>
</dcq:identifier.citation>
</dcq:relation.references>
</a_dcq>

And could be linked against B using {creator,title,date}:

<b>
<dc:identifier>doi:24-23123/xxxyyy</dc:identifier>
<dc:identifier>Smith, John, Smith, Joan (1992) Functional Principles in
Functions, J-Principles volume 5 45-50</dc:identifier>
<dc:creator>Smith, John</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Smith, Joan</dc:creator>
<dc:title>Functional Principles in Functions</dc:title>
<dc:date>1992</dc:date>
</b>

I've no doubt the same can be achieved through OpenURL, but DC is more
widely used (so the closer to DC, and the more use of DC elements, the
greater the adoption will be, hence the greater the interoperability).

I don't like marc XML because IMHO "<id type='xxx'>", where xxx is a code,
is not useful beyond library systems (i.e. marc XML isn't comprehensible to
the human-reader, at which point you may as well use more efficient binary
mark-up).

All the best,
Tim.

What error condition do you wish to report that is not covered 
by the existing error codes? I did not find any when writing 
my server. 

My feeling is that 503 is not to be used for errors in the 
same sense as <error> replies. 503 is for cases when the
service is unavailable -- it may be used for flow control
or perhaps temporary outages such as might occur with large
updates.

Cheers,
Simeon.

Tim,

I will answer Carl's email when I've had time to think a bit more about it. 
But I would like to make a few comments on yours, and in particular 
correct a few DC encodings.
> 
> "dc:identifier is an unambiguous reference to a resource" - citations
> are intended to be unambiguous references. 
I agree with this. But dc:identifier is the identifier of the resource  
the metadata record describes. This applies also to any qualifiers 
of dc:identifier. The proposed qualifier 'citation' is a qualifier of 
dc:identifier. So using dc:identifier or dcterms:citation for a 
reference does not comply with DC recommendations.

This is alos my understanding.

Several things about this example:

The accepted way now of encoding DC in XML is to use the 
qualifier name directly within the dcterms namespace (dcq is a 
synonym for dcterms) without its parent element, and not to use 
the dot notation. So <dcq:relation.references> would be written as 
simply <dcterms:references>. 

dcterms:citation is a proposed qualifier for dc:identifier not for 
dc:relation (which already has the references qualifier), so shouldn't 
be nested inside a dc:relation. So the reference as a string could 
be encoded as:

<dcterms:references>Smith, John (1992) "Functional Principles in 
Functions" v5 44-50</dcterms:references>

After that: dcq:identifier.citation, better dcterms:citation, is not valid 
DC nested within a dc:relation. It would be possible to propose a 
similar sub-structure for dcterms:references to that proposed for 
dcterms:citation but it is not currently a valid encoding. But the 
proposed structure of dcterms:citation does not include the 'top-
level' DC elements (creator, date). I assume ja:volume is from 
Herbert's OpenURL email.

Of course the encoding you present will be valid XML given 
appropriate namespace declarations. But it is not valid DC because 
it does not follow DC recommendations. So I would dispute 
whether you should be calling it DC at all. This then becomes an 
argument for Carl's suggested parallel format.

The main reason DC is more widely used is that it's been around 
much longer. OpenURL is about citations, DC isn't - it is a basic 
core metadata. I agree that more use of DC will mean greater 
adoption, simply because it has developed a reputation. But using 
DC incorrectly will actually deter interoperability. Using OpenURL, 
as it becomes more widely adopted will increase interoperability.

I am trying to be objective about this, but should probably declare 
my interests - I am chair of the DC-Citation working group and also 
a member of the OpenURL NISO committee.

Best wishes,
	Ann

Summary for the casual reader:

1. Detailed Citation data about a resource and data about its references
are important imformation to make available
2. This information does not fit into the purposely simplistic (and very
useful) DC data model (qualified or unqualified)
3. Since OAI-PMH accommodates multiple metadata formats, why try to cram
the information into DC and why not make it available in a more
specialized format.

Now to respond to Tim and for the more interested reader....


Tim, 

I'm trying to parse out where we dissagree :-(

>From my point of view this is one of those "how much to we shove into
DC" questions that has been kicked around for quite a while.  Somehow
these keep getting conflated with the qualifier argument, which has a
pretty legitimate model now associated with it.

For qualifiers, the model is more or less an "is a" relationship for
elements and values.  For example, "created" makes a proper qualifier
for "date" since "date created is a date".  Similarly, "LCHS" makes a
proper qualifier for "subject" since a "LCSH subject is a subject".  

The model starts to crumble at the edges when one tries to introduce
"has a" relationships within the DC element structure.  The DC community
has, for example, continually struggle over "agent" descriptors to say
things like "the creator is Carl Lagoze and he is affiliated with
Cornell University", which effectively introduces a new intermediate
entity, which in pseudo E-R language is "R has a creator CL that has an
affiliation Cornell".  

This is exactly what is happening when one tries to say things like:

<meta name="DC.Identifier.citation" 
content="Library and Information Science Research 22(3), 311-338
(2000)">

In that the entity Library and Information Science Research is being
introduced that "has a" volume "22" and issue # "3". 

This is bad enough: but now if one also wants to express sentences like
"A references B, which has the bibliographic data "Journal of silly
results, June 2000, 40(3)", we are going way down the entity chain.  

This is NOT Dublin Core, which has and should have a very limited data
model.  It IS important metadata about an item and we should have a way
of expressing it.  Fine, let's come up with some format and make it
available through OAI-PMH.

[Carl's summary, with a new point 3]
1. Detailed Citation data about a resource and data about its references
are important imformation to make available
2. This information does not fit into the purposely simplistic (and very
useful) DC data model (qualified or unqualified)
3. This should be achieved through a parallel format to oai_dc

Read on ...

[DC/q/Citation]

Thank you to Ann and Carl for providing very informative responses:
If I can summarise by saying DC/q can only describe one level of
relationship, e.g.:
Item -> Author
Item -> URI

While reference data requires two levels:
Item A -> Item B -> Author
Item A -> Item B -> URI

(So <dcq:citation/> fits with the DC model, while
<dcq:references><dcq:citation/> does not)

[OpenURL/DC]

Reading Andy Powell's and Ann's Ariadne article:
http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue27/metadata/

You describe how an OpenURL URI could be used within "dcq:citation" and
"dcq:references" to provide citation descriptions.

You succinctly summarise my worries with OpenURL in a DC world:
"Therefore, the OpenURL DESCRIPTION appears to offer all the functionality
identified by the working group for encoding bibliographic citations for
simple resource discovery, albeit using a less human-readable syntax than
that proposed by the working group.   However, it may not offer the required
functionality for individual Dublin Core based applications."

Putting these into two points:

1) I have always got the feeling OpenURL deals with the "ideal" world. For
my application, whether something is a conference proceeding, or journal
article, isn't useful (and probably can't be determined). What is useful is
knowing that this "thing" has a title, and an author, that can be compared
to titles and authors in a database (most likely DC records).

2) In XML, I suspect a more elegant syntax could be used than OpenURL (which
uses overloading to cope with name=value URIs).

I want to use OpenURL if it is the right choice, not because it is the only
choice. And at the moment, I don't think its the right choice - hence my
suggestion for a "DC-inspired" format :-)

Regards,
Tim.

2 comments:

* The more information one can provide to an application, the higher the chance
it can do something useful with it.  So, if one does have the information that
something is -- for instance -- a conference proceeding, it is extrememely
usefull to expose such information to applications.  That means: one should not
limit options from the start.  I am sure linking servers wouldn't be pleased at
all if we would start feeding them only Unqualified Dublin Core, as that would
limit their capabilities.

* Regarding the "ideal" world: I guess you are referring to the current version
of OpenURL, not the upcoming NISO version (of which I sent examples).  In that
version, all kinds of metadata formats can be used.  That includes expressive
formats, targeted at describing -- say -- a conference proceeding, as well as
less descriptive general-purpose ones, say Unqualified Dublin Core.  So, if in
your application there is no way that you can determine whether something is a
conference proceeding, and hence you are not in a position to use an expressive
format, you can use unqualified Dublin Core within OpenURL.  As a matter, of
fact in the XML-encoding (see below) you can do both at the same time.

> 2) In XML, I suspect a more elegant syntax could be used than OpenURL (which

Again, I think you are referring to the current version of OpenURL.  The NISO
version will come with a name=value encoding (because HTTP GET is something that
seems to be used a lot out there) and hopefully/probably with an XML encoding.

With the upcoming OpenURL, you don't have to make an a priori choice regarding
the format that you will use to describe a reference.  OpenURL becomes a
"container" in which you can stuff a reference described in a variety of ways,
as well as descriptions of the context in which the citation appears (such as
the paper in which the reference is made).

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206211803080.2357-100000@ice.cs.cornell.edu>

There was a bug in the oai-identifier schema as released with OAI-PMH
v2.0. Xerces (2.0.1) reports errors because of the lack of type
definitions for the two elements with fixed values: scheme and delimiter.
Corrected versions of the schema and guidelines document are now online:
  http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai-identifier.xsd 
  http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-oai-identifier.htm
(Schema diff included below.)

Many thanks to Naomi Dushay for pointing out this problem and for
helping check the new version (checked with Xerces, Topologi and xsv).

Cheers,
Simeon

For example: One record in my database is wrong and I can not obtain
datestamp information for this record. 
I could say "cannotDisseminateFormat" but in truth I can disseminate format,
I just cannot get datestamp.

What error condition do you wish to report that is not covered 
by the existing error codes? I did not find any when writing 
my server. 

My feeling is that 503 is not to be used for errors in the 
same sense as <error> replies. 503 is for cases when the
service is unavailable -- it may be used for flow control
or perhaps temporary outages such as might occur with large
updates.

Cheers,
Simeon.

interesting...  all of the errors defined in OAI-PMH are about OAI-based
errors / exception conditions.  there is no provision for lower-level
errors, such as problems in the database.

I think the lack of a datestamp might be enough to say that this record
does not exist in an OAI-context.  

from section 2.5:

A record is identified unambigiously by the combination of the unique
identifier of the item from which the record is available, the
metadataPrefix identifying the metadata format of the record, and the
datestamp of the record.


so if you don't have 1 of {id,metadataPrefix,datestamp}, I don't think you
have a record.  I would either:

1.  ignore this record for OAI purposes

or

2.  make up a datestamp for the record.  it should not be hard to define
some lower bound for the record; use whatever you put in earliestDatestamp
in your Identify response.

Michael

Hi Michael, 

I think that if we don't have error codes for low-level errors your solution
#2 (some lower level bound)
is the most suitable.

I think I'm about half way to agreeing with you. This approach does 
require a model which includes parallel metadata formats. So it 
would be OK for OAI, which is what we're talking about on this list.

So we could have a metadata format, say oai-cite (that's not a 
good name! - just something to work with). Then you could encode 
the metadata for a journal article something like as follows. I'm just 
considering the metadata for the article itself, not any references it 
may have - but probably a metadata format for those could be 
incorporated. (Doing this quickly, I've not included any schema 
declarations.)

<metadata>
<cite:atitle>Studying E-journal User Behavior Using Log 
Files</cite:atitle>
<cite:author>Xu,Y</cite:author>
<cite:author>Apps,A</cite:author>
<cite:jtitle>Library and Information Science Research</cite:jtitle>
<cite:volume>22</cite:volume>
<cite:issue>3</cite:issue>
<cite:spage>311</cite:spage>
<cite:year>2000</cite:year>
</metadata>

But this is looking very similar to the OpenURL journal article 
metadata, which leads me to wonder if that can be used here as 
well. The main concern is that this is not a referent (or subject of a 
citation link) but rather an identification by citation metadata, 
unless it's seen as an introverted, self-referential link. Maybe this is 
an OpenURL context-object with a referring-entity but no referent?

To go back to the qualified Dublin Core case, from another email:

> <meta name="DC.Identifier.citation" 
> content="Library and Information Science Research 22(3), 311- 
338 (2000)">
> In that the entity Library and Information Science Research is 
being introduced that "has a" volume "22" and issue # "3". 

This is intended to be an "is a" relation where the entire content of 
this string 'is a' citation, and hence identifier of the article. There is 
no intention to say anything about the journal or issue outside of 
that exact citation. I think this is the same as an OpenURL citation 
where the complete set of metadata within the OpenURL identifies 
a particluar article by its citation. In fact, in OpenURL, different sets 
of metadata elements are used for journal articles (ja) and journal 
issues (ji). It is just coincidence that some of the constituents look 
the same to human readers. 

The document 'Guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML' 
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dc-xml-guidelines/ includes 
examples of mixing DC metadata within other schemas. So I think 
one could include OpenURL jounal article metadata with a DC 
record (assuming it is alright to use the OpenURL journal article 
schema stand-alone).

For example:

<metadata>
<dc:title>Studying E-journal User Behavior Using Log 
Files</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Xu,Y</dc:creator>
<dc:creator>Apps,A</dc:creator>
<dcterms:created>2000</dcterms:created>
<ja:jtitle>Library and Information Science Research</ja:jtitle>
<ja:volume>22</ja:volume>
<ja:issue>3</ja:issue>
<ja:spage>311</ja:spage>
</metadata>

	Ann

  I for one would like to use something like:

<error code="ServerDown">Service unavailable.  Retry in one
hour</error>

 with a 503 code, but obviously that's not in the protocol.

I meant that in the situation when we don't have error codes for low-level
errors 
Michael solution #2 is the best solution for my specific problem with
datestamp.
In general I would prefer special error code(s) for low-level errors.

Do you mean that your response will contain both error code "ServiceDown"
and HTTP error code 503?
Is it possible?

Thanks, 
Irina

Actually, this is in the protocol

>From the v2.0 specficiations document

3.1.2.2 Status-Code
OAI-PMH errors are distinguished from HTTP Status-Codes. Since OAI-PMH
uses HTTP as a transport layer, servers implementing OAI-PMH must conform
to HTTP status code definitions and report relevant HTTP transport layer
status via those Status-Codes. OAI-PMH repositories may employ HTTP
Status-Codes in addition to "200 OK".For instance, the following
Status-Codes may be useful for load balancing in OAI repositories:

*	302 - Allows the repository to temporarily redirect an OAI-PMH
request to another repository. The URI of the temporary repository should
be given by the Location field in the HTTP response.
*	503 - Service unavailable, a Retry-After period is specified.
Harvesters should wait this period before attempting another OAI-PMH
request.

I'm afraid I wasn't clear.
Is is forbidden to use an error code for this situation since it is not
in the protocol?

yes, it is forbidden.  you can't make up your own error codes and have the
response validate against the schema.

I suppose you could overload an existing code, like badVerb or
badArgument, but this is not advisable b/c it would like confuse
harvesters.

these aren't really OAI errors per se, they're system errors.  the right
way to handle this is probably to issue http codes of 500 or 503.

   I know the protocol states that a single error is enough to trigger
an error response but it seems to imply that all codes should be
returned.
   If in the case of the illegal argument, where a value like
test=zzzzzz is sent, should this short circuit the testing process 
and jump straight to the error response without testing from, until,
set, etc., since someone could be trying to break something?

  Should a multiple argument error be "badArgument" and then should we
indicate which word was repeated?  (example below)

   repository/oai?verb=Identify&set=set1&from=2000-01-01&set=set2

errors:
<error code="badArgument">The query contained an illegal
argument--set</error>
<error code="badArgument">The query contained an illegal
argument--from</error>
<error code="badArgument">The query contained an illegal
argument--set</error>

  Are these all of the codes or should there be another one because
Identify should have no other parameters?

it seems error reporting specified at this moment are mostly used by the 
harvester, which I doubt will understand what it means "database is down". I 
think layers of abstraction is a good approach to the error reporting. The 
specification does not stop someone from generating their own debugging 
message, which may not return as part of a xml stream at all, it may very well 
be a log of some kind kept internal. As far as the harvester is conerned, 
either a record is avaliable or not avaliable or when it will be avaliable. 
There may be additional error codes needed, but I think any none OAI protocol 
related errors should be abstracted into layers and handled accordingly.

Correct me if I'm wrong. The arguments specified for the verbs are 'required' 
but may not be the only arguments being passed to the provider. I doubt the 
badArgument error applies in this case. If verb=Identify is a valid argument 
and no other 'required' arguments is missing/dup/illegal, then the server 
should ignor the other arguments (or one may implement their own additional 
"features" using extra arguments).

I disagree. Arguments that are not 'required', 'optional' or 'exclusive'
are 'illegal' and should generate badArgument errors. This is how I read
the spec for badArgument:

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#ErrorConditions
"The request includes illegal arguments, is missing required arguments,
includes a repeated argument, or values for arguments have an illegal
syntax."

Cheers,
Simeon

I think it is allowable to either short circuit checks or to test other
arguments.

I think the response above is fine.

The philosophy should be to provide error messages that are helpful
to someone trying to work out why their harvester isn't working.

PS. My server checks for duplicate arguments first because the 
arguments are then stored in a hash. Thus the error messages 
from the request above are:

<error code="badArgument">Found illegal duplicate of argument 'set'.</error>
<error code="badArgument">Verb 'Identify', illegal argument 'set'.</error>
<error code="badArgument">Verb 'Identify', illegal argument 'from'.</error>

Here's another data point, our server returns:

  <error code="badArgument">Illegal argument 'from'</error>
  <error code="badArgument">Illegal argument 'set'</error>

Thanks for clarify this. This does make OAI more restrictive, what is

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Looking for 2.0 server with completeListSize in resumptionToken
Message-ID: <20020627192845.L3083@io.mds.rmit.edu.au>

Hi,
I have a couple of questions actually

(1) Is there a 2.0 server out there now which supports completeListSize
    in the resumption token?

(2) Just wondering if the list of sites on the 'community' list of
    data providers page could/should include a protocol version number.

(3) Again on the community list of data providers page, should the
    name be automatically worked out from the repository?
    Or does anyone else have a more up to date list?

We are just cleaning up some things on an implementation we are playing
with. I will try and put a copy up outside the firewall here so people
can have a look at the logs etc for when we crawl other people.
Lots of little bugs still I am sure.

Alan

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Status of my.OAI
Message-ID: <B9406E42.5682%francois@fsconsult.com>

Hi

I wanted to update everyone on the status of my.OAI. Unfortunately I am
going to have to pull the plug on further development of the system. I am
going to be putting in one final update this weekend and that will be all,
and it is very likely that I am going to pull the system altogether at the
end of July. 

This project has been fun to work on and I started off with three goals:

- First was to develop a new search user interface to my search engine on
top of a new API I developed which allows searching of very different
databases with a single U/I. This was achieved rather well I feel, the U/I
can search databases served up by my own search engine or databases on
PubMed without modification.

- Second was to provide a good, free, search interface to the slowly
increasing volume of OAI accessible data out there, I think that was
achieved too.

- Third was to focus some attention onto my products and my consulting
services by building a showcase system and generate some business. That part
has not worked out at all. The fact that the consulting market appears to
have collapsed makes it very difficult for me to justify keeping this system
running, indeed my collocated server.

So unless things really pick up, which I doubt given the current state of
the economy, I will most likely be pulling the system at the end of July.

Best regards

Francois

Message-ID: <407770AC-8AA9-11D6-92FE-0003934CA344@umich.edu>

[Apologies for cross-posting.]

The University of Michigan Libraries Digital Library Production Service 
is pleased to announce the launch of the OAIster search interface, 
version 1.

	http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/b/bib/bib-idx?c=oaister;page=simple

OAIster has harvested a large number of records from a variety of 
institutions -- 274046 records from 55 institutions -- that have made 
these records available using the OAI protocol (see 
http://www.openarchives.org/). Each of these records leads to an actual 
digital resource hosted at an institution.

You can learn more about a particular institution's collection we are 
harvesting at http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/viewcolls.html. We are also 
committed to improving our service -- see our future plans and the 
progress we are making at http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/phase2.html.

We are very interested in gathering more records, OAI-enabled or 
snapshots of records that aren't yet OAI-enabled, to include in our 
service. The more records we serve, the more valuable this service 
becomes for the end-user. Please get in touch with me at khage@umich.edu 
to discuss this further.

Regards,
Kat

Apologies! For those of you who are Netscape users, this wasn't working 
until a minute ago. It should work now.

Couldn't find a link to code for OAIster on your site. Is OAIster Open
Source? It seems like your middleware (DLXS is it?) is.

I think it follows the general principle that strong error checking is
better than weak error checking. The simpler and tighter the specification
the more likely it is that different implementations will interoperate as
intended. This serves the goals of the OAI.

(It is clearly possible to extend the protocol and I know people are
building systems for which this is necessary. However, I'd say this should
be done only when additional functionality is required.)

Cheers,
Simeon.
