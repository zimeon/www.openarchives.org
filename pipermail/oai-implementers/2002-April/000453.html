This is one of the reasons why a multi-item GetRecord was not included in
v2.0. This may be more reasonable if OAI is later embedded in something
like SOAP.

&gt;<i> Periodic complete rehavesting seems the best solution with the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol as is.
</I>
That is probably the safest approach with v1.1. 
(In v2.0, this should not be necessary for a repository that claims to
track deleted records forever.)

Cheers,
Simeon.
