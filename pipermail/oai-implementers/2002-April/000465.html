<PRE>I can't see a reply to this, apologies if these questions were already
answered.

</I>&gt;<i>

GetRecord and ListMetadataFormats are the only ways to request
information about a specific item (they have identifier as an
argument).

If a repository does not keep track of 'deleted' items and change 
the datestamp accordingly then nothing will show up in ListRecords
or ListIdentifiers when and item is deleted.
 
&gt;<i> Digging further I see that the GetRecord schema notes that a 
</I>&gt;<i> record *can* be returned with a deleted status -- which seems 
</I>&gt;<i> contrary to the above? 
</I>
Yes, a &lt;record&gt; can be returned (if the repository keeps track of deleted 
records), but no &lt;metadata&gt; block. The documentation really means 
the &lt;metadata&gt; block when it says 'record' here.
 
&gt;<i> However if an identifer doesn't exist then no record will be returned in 
</I>&gt;<i> the GetRecord response.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So is it the case that records for items with a deleted status will always 
</I>&gt;<i> be available (i.e. the metadata is can still be harvested) but 
</I>&gt;<i> after a period (determined by the archive) GetRecord may 
</I>&gt;<i> subsequently return no metadata.
</I>
For as long as a repository keeps a record of 'deleted' items, it can
return a &lt;record&gt; which has a &lt;header&gt; block but no &lt;metadata&gt; block. If,
after some period, it forgets about the item (stops keeping 'deleted'
status) then no &lt;record&gt; block will be returned.
 
(These concepts will be much better documented in v2.0 but the ideas 
are not significantly changed.)

Cheers,
Simeon.
