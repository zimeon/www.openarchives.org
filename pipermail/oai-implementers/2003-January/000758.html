CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
NETWORKING MULTIMEDIA RESOURCES
3RD OPEN ARCHIVES FORUM WORKSHOP

The organizing committee is very pleased to announce the 3rd Open
Archives Forum Workshop, which
will be held in Berlin on 27-29th March, 2003. Registration is opened on
the Open Archives Forum
website (<A HREF="http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/">http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/</A>).

The aim of the Berlin workshop is to explore which specific requirements
and demands ought to be
carefully weighed and considered before a digital media archive is made
available via the Internet.
Within this workshop we will discuss different approaches to network
media repositories, libraries,
archives and other information resources using the Open Archives
Initiative technical framework for
metadata harvesting.

The workshop will consist of both presentations given by invited
speakers and small group breakout
sessions where the participants can discuss key issues, such as:
*   Metadata for multimedia-objects
*   Demands for an Application profile for media archives
*   University services in this field
*   User needs/Usage conditions versus technical, legal, access issues
*   Cross searching distributed Internet information resources
*   Collaboration among different cultural heritage institutions /
Multi-Institutional ventures

A tutorial on the implementation of OAI-PMH will be held the day before
the workshop (on March 27th)
for those who are not familiar with this protocol. One of the workshop
speakers will be Herbert van
de Sompel (Cornell University) representing the Open Archives Initiative
(OAI) with an update of OAI
activities.

Who should attend
*   People from media service institutions, museums, digitization
projects and librarians who are
considering making their repositories of information available via the
Internet;
*   technical, research and project managers who are interested in
providing third party services
for interoperable open archives and libraries.
*   decision makers in the area of libraries, media centres and museums
looking for new strategic
opportunities to promote their organizations and working areas.

About the Open Archives Forum:
The Open Archives Forum provides a Europe-based focus for dissemination
of information about
European activity related to open archives and, in particular, to the
Open Archives Initiative. The
aim of the Forum is to facilitate clustering of IST projects, national
initiatives and other parties
interested in the open archives approach. In order to do so, OA-Forum
brings interested parties
together to build a community of interest, enable exchange of
information and establish a web-based
European information source for open archives. In addition, OA-Forum
undertakes comparative reviews
of technical and organisational issues. OA-Forum is funded as an
accompanying measure within the
Information Societies Technology (IST) Programme, a theme of the
European Union's Fifth Framework
Programme managed by the Information Society Directorate-General of the
European Commission.
The partners of OAF are: University of Bath-UKOLN (United Kingdom),
Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie
della Informazione - CNR (Italy) and Computer- and Media Service
(Computing Center) of Humboldt
University (Germany).
