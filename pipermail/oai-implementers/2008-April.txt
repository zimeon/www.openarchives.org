Subject: [OAI-implementers] metadata formats - supporting multiple versions

This line of inquiry is very intriguing to me also.   If I wanted to  
server out more domain specific data types (EAD, DDI, TEI) and/or just  
the metadata headers from those formats I haven't found any reference  
examples to know how to form a metadataPrefix that others share as  
well (oai_ead-h ?).   I've long wished there were a central online  
registry of existing metadataPrefixes, schemas, and metadataNamespaces  
for repository interoperability.   Versioning of schemas adds another  
layer of complexity to the issue.

When I was at the OAI-ORE rollout in Baltimore recently, I did ask  
Herbert van de Sompel about "minting" new metadataPrefixes.   It was a  
brief exchange as he was quite busy, but if he understood my question  
and I his answer, he places heavy emphasis on the particular schema  
being referenced and much less on the metadataPrefix.

If that's true, then the burden would be on the OAI harvester to  
correctly parse and interpret the referenced schema in order to  
determine what metadata format was being referenced.   Which no  
existing OAI harvester I know of actually does, AND which would not  
work consistently anyway, e.g. with reference to versioning.   The  
Marc21 slim xsd (http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/schema/MARC21slim.xsd 
) for instance makes use of a version attribute in its xsd:schema  
namespace, but I notice that none of the mods schemas use a similar  
convention.

Hi all,

I'm trying to clarify the expected behavior when a list request includes
multiple set arguments. For example, "&set=A&set=B". Would/should this
return the union of the two sets or the intersection?

Hello Jay,

OAI-PMH does not allow for multiple "set" arguments, so in a single list
request you'll have to choose one or the other.

Since all set memberships are included in the record header, you get
intersection "for free":

verb=ListIdentifiers&set=A

will return all members of A, but those headers will also say if they are
in B.  To get a union, you'll have to do both:

verb=ListIdentifiers&set=A
verb=ListIdentifiers&set=B

regards,

Michael

Interesting question.... I would expect most systems to respond ambiguously
since this would overload the one 'set' property.

Chuck,

I don't know about other implementations, but the apache module,
"mod_oai" responds with an error message if more than one set spec is
in the request string.

OAICAT-based implementations -- well, at least ours -- also give an 
error message.

Message-ID: <48ece0fc0804101528j672cdfb8m70a10d3eba6fe1e4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello - We're very close to launching our data provider. Before we do I have
a question about date-stamps.

I understand that the "from" and "until" dates used to request metadata
records refer to the date that the metadata record was created. We are an
archive of research works that date back to the 1980s (we will definitely
get even older works into our archive as we move forward). To my mind it
would be more helpful to folks if our record date-stamps reflect the date
the research work in question was first published.

My concern is that we introduce our repository and harvesters don't get the
gist of the temporal scope of our collection because everything is
date-stamped en masse with the date that we generate our metadata records
(which, with luck, will be this Saturday).

I hope I'm making sense! Just want to know if this is a big no-no, or if
there are things to consider before doing something like this. Appreciate
the insight of list participants.

Thanks for reading -

Hello,

As far as I understand the OAI protocol, I would rather say that 
DateStamp is about the last time that your record has been updated 
(which then must reflect "create", "update" or "delete").

When you will first register your archive into a Harvester, I guess the 
harvester will first get all records available. To do so, it will query 
your archive without the "from" and "to" parameter.

Then, most of harvesters will run regularly some incremental harvesting 
to get the records modified, deleted or added since the previous 
harvest. To do so they will run the query with the "from" parameter.

Kind regards,
Fred

Hi Lisa

 

I find that it is always helpful to put yourself in the shoes of someone who
wants to harvest your data. 

 

If the smallest record count that can be obtained from your system as the
result of an initial OAI ListRecords request (including dates and/or sets)
is very large, it can be quite difficult for harvesting systems to
successfully complete an ?initial population? from your data without other
influences (network  connectivity, target response time, resumption token
lifetime etc.) having an increasing bearing on the successful outcome of the
harvest.  

 

For example, having a repository containing 200,000 records, all dated the
same day and not supporting a request granularity of less than 1 day makes
initial population more difficult for any harvesting system J. 

 

I do not know how many records you have so this may not be an issue for you
but I think it is worth bearing in mind. 

 

Cheers

 

Rob

Hi Lisa,

The OAI-PMH is pretty explicit about not doing what you're asking.  The
OAI-PMH datestamps are about when the record was added (or updated) in the
repository.  The publication date (or discovery date, or ...) is reflected
in the metadata you are exporting.  People that harvest your metadata will
index the publciation date and throw the OAI-PMH datestamps away -- they
exist only to support harvesting.

Here is a scenario on why you don't want to set your OAI-PMH datestamps to
your publication date.

- 2008-04-11, you initially publish 500,000 records.  They have OAI-PMH
datestamps of 1985-01-01 through 2008-04-11.

- 2008-04-12, I discover your site for the first time and do a baseline
harvest.  I get all your metadata records (since I haven't harvested you
before).  My harvester decides to revist your site every week and ask
what's new.

- 2008-04-14, you publish 100,000 more records with datestamps of
1981-01-01 through 1984-12-31.

- 2008-04-19, I return to your site and say:

?verb=ListRecords&metadatPrefix=abc&from=2008-04-12

Now my harvester will miss your 100,000 new records since they were added
"earlier" in time and not later.

In summary, be honest about your datestamps or people will miss your
updates.  Harvesters / service providers won't confuse datestamps with
publication dates.

regards,

Michael

Hi Lisa,

I think the one exception is already pointed out in Michael's reply, but I'll
make it explicit: BEFORE your data provider is public you can use historical 
datestamps to populate. Harvesters will be expecting this for the initial 
baseline harvest.

However, as Michael very nicely illustrates, after the data provider has been 
made public all updates/additions must be refelected with the time of 
update/addition in the datestamp to avoid missing updates.

Cheers,
Simeon

Just a thought ... we organize our set hierarchy to include year of
publication so at least to that granularity one can retrieve data based on
publication date.

Hi Lisa,

The OAI-PMH is pretty explicit about not doing what you're asking.  The
OAI-PMH datestamps are about when the record was added (or updated) in the
repository.  The publication date (or discovery date, or ...) is reflected
in the metadata you are exporting.  People that harvest your metadata will
index the publciation date and throw the OAI-PMH datestamps away -- they
exist only to support harvesting.

Here is a scenario on why you don't want to set your OAI-PMH datestamps to
your publication date.

- 2008-04-11, you initially publish 500,000 records.  They have OAI-PMH
datestamps of 1985-01-01 through 2008-04-11.

harvest.  I get all your metadata records (since I haven't harvested you
before).  My harvester decides to revist your site every week and ask
what's new.

- 2008-04-14, you publish 100,000 more records with datestamps of
1981-01-01 through 1984-12-31.

?verb=ListRecords&metadatPrefix=abc&from=2008-04-12

Now my harvester will miss your 100,000 new records since they were added
"earlier" in time and not later.

In summary, be honest about your datestamps or people will miss your
updates.  Harvesters / service providers won't confuse datestamps with
publication dates.

I?m not sure I agree. Any robust harvester software should be able to
*initially* harvest regardless of datestamp.

Problems such as network connectivity, etc. should be addressed in the
harvesting software to allow as close to seamless harvesting as possible.
For example, software should have a timeout feature that provides for
network issues (e.g., waits 1 minute before trying again). If robust
software is not able to handle these problems, it?s most likely an issue on
the data provider side, in my experience.

Hi Kat

I am not saying that harvesting software shouldn't be robust or be able to
recover from errors (where possible). However, I still reckon that
performing some (pretty rudimentary) data analysis and adhering to a few
basic principles when exposing your data, can make harvesting easier. 

In my experience as a harvester (when dealing with large collections), I
would much rather set up an instruction to sequentially issue (for example)
50 date bounded requests (starting with the earliest date stamp from the
identify response). 50 x 4000 is much better than 1 x 200,000 IMHO :)

Cheers

Rob

Hi Rob,

But your harvester handles resumptionTokens, right? So, it's not 1 x 200,000
requests if those 200,000 are broken into rTs of 500 each, say. I'm
interested in how your harvesting system is set up that makes it easier to
harvest by multiple bounded date requests rather than one single request.

We use a homegrown solution (http://sourceforge.net/umoaitoolkit) which
we've tweaked as time goes on to handle server outages and such, but we
don't have trouble with most of our large harvests, e.g., HighWire has over
a million and as a rule takes about 8 hours to run from scratch.

Regards,
 -Kat

	creation date for data provider "from" and "until" searches

Hi Kat

I am not advocating a different harvesting methodology I am just approaching from a different perspective. In my 'OAI world' (and based on my experiences) not all targets are perfect and not all errors are recoverable. If all OAI targets were created equal and performed faultlessly then there would not be a strategy to discuss. 

My experience is that they aren't and that the devil (as with everything) is in the implementation. 

So as I see it the difference between 50 x 4000 and 1 x 200,000 is:

In the first scenario, you have an entirely complete OAI request after every 4000 records and any unrecoverable failure (of either the harvester or target) results in a re-harvest of 4000 records - worst case rollback 3999 records (even after 199,999 have been harvested) 

In the second scenario,  any unrecoverable failure results in a re-harvest of 200,000 records -  worst case rollback of 199,999 records. In addition the repository has to deal with the burden of persistence and resumption for a great deal longer which arguably increases both its workload and the chance of failure.

In our imperfect world and given that I am not a betting man I would always choose the first approach if it were available to me.

Does this make me a pessimist :) ?


Cheers

Rob

Well, I would never consider myself an optimist, actually.  ;)

But, while I do understand your approach, in my experience there have been
very, very few unrecoverable errors when harvesting large repositories. If
there is an error of this type, it's generally because the data repository
server has failed, and consequently has nothing to do with rTs, persistence
or anything of that ilk. And that will be a problem whether we pick the
first scenario or the second one.

I suppose it comes down to how you've built your software-- I had never
thought of the data-bounded approach, which is an interesting and
potentially less risky method. (Or more risky because certain datestamps may
be missed...to come back full circle.)

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI2LOD
Message-ID: <4818CFCB.80900@lanl.gov>

hi all,

I felt like drawing you attention to an OAI-PMH tool that has been 
created by the Linked Data community:

(*) The OAI2LOD server is described and available at:
http://www.mediaspaces.info/tools/oai2lod/

(*) A paper was presented at the recent WWW Conference Linked Data 
Workshop:
http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2008/papers/03-haslhofer-schandl-oai2lod-server.pdf

(*) And Tim Berners Lee took quite some interest in this development, as 
can be seen from:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2008Apr/0183.html

Thanks to Chris Bizer for the pointers.

cheers

Herbert
