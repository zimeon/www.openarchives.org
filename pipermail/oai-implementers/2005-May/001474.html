A somewhat late response to this thread...

I think that they key to avoiding sets being misused as a poor man's
search is education. We must keep repeating the mantra that this is not
what OAI-PMH was designed to do and if search is desired then SRU/SRW or
similar should be used. Shirley Hyatt and Jeff Young have demonstrated
OAI-PMH and SRU/SRW playing nicely together at OCLC
(<A HREF="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march05/hyatt/03hyatt.html">http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march05/hyatt/03hyatt.html</A>)

The problem of items moving out of sets is a real one, and one we need to
address within the protocol.

Having said this, there may be situations where Robert's suggestion makes
sense. However, just as with sets, I suspect deployment should be
judicious -- to meet real selective harvesting needs.  I note that one
additional requirement for implementation is that items MUST be identified
using a recognized global URI scheme. Unless that is the case then
harvesters should assume that ids within OAI-PMH responses are local, and
then multiple repositories with the same content would be confusing.

Cheers,
Simeon

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issues with sets, and I'm not sure which of these we are really trying to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; address.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) The tendency of people to misunderstand sets as a sort of poor man's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; search.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that by moving the set name into the URL it doesn't get rid of
</I>&gt;<i> this, but it does lessen the tendancy to think this way.  When it's a
</I>&gt;<i> parameter in the query, it's easy to cram any arbitrary value in there.
</I>&gt;<i> It's less intuitive to do this when the set name is part of the URL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Technical issues relating to how to signal that a record has been moved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out of a set, but has not been deleted from the repository.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This wasn't something I was thinking of when writing it up, but it does
</I>&gt;<i> fall out neatly from the proposal -- you simply set them deleted in the
</I>&gt;<i> set repository.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) How best to describe a set: there is a technical description such as how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many items are in the set and what the updated frequency is.  There is also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the conceptual description, such as the records in this set are all described
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by this subject heading, or they all belong to this &quot;collection,&quot; or they all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have this publishing status.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage here is that you have all of the best practices and schemas
</I>&gt;<i> for the Identify verb for the set descriptions. What exactly
</I>&gt;<i> to put in here is still in need of work, but I think it's a good start to
</I>&gt;<i> allow the full Identify information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) Issues such as whether its a good idea to have overlapping sets, flat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sets, hierarchical sets, and in which circumstances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whether it's a good idea? I'm not going to comment on that, besides the
</I>&gt;<i> point that there are heirarchical collections and sub-collections, so it's
</I>&gt;<i> natural to describe these in a hierarchical tree of sets.
</I>&gt;<i> The main advantage here is that everything falls out neatly -- if you want
</I>&gt;<i> a tree, then design your URLs to be a tree.  If you want overlapping, flat
</I>&gt;<i> or any other design, then it's up to the design of the URL paths, not the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol to try and fit all of the requirements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5) Variations in how different implementers have interpretted the OAI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;data model&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that the proposal addresses this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Briefly some of my misgivings:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does Rob's model place an excessive burden on data providers, or service
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; providers?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The burden on the data providers can be done in at least two different
</I>&gt;<i> ways -- either multiple instances of the script, or one server which
</I>&gt;<i> handles everything.  Multiple instances is easier than the status quo (no
</I>&gt;<i> sets, no extra URLs).  One server is as hard as the status quo, but
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the underlying architecture it may be no more difficult, or
</I>&gt;<i> it may be quite a bit harder (at which point, there's always multiple
</I>&gt;<i> instances of the server code)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For service providers, it should be easier, as they can simply follow the
</I>&gt;<i> links in the &lt;friends&gt; section, rather than having to construct parameters
</I>&gt;<i> from the listSets response.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does it fundamentally alter the underlying data model of OAI, for better or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worse?  Previously, I think that items belonged to one or more sets, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; records were disseminations of these items in a specific format.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rob's model alters this to something like records being disseminations of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; items within the context of those items being contained in a particular set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mmmmm. I have no real comment here.  There's nothing to prevent you from
</I>&gt;<i> having different representations of the same object disseminated in
</I>&gt;<i> different sets, but that's no different to today where some providers make
</I>&gt;<i> sets available per record schema.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that's a best practice issue which should be addressed, but is
</I>&gt;<i> mostly orthogonal to the proposal?
