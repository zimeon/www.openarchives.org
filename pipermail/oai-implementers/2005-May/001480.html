<PRE>
  Given the dependency of OAI on XML Schema, I hope this will be 
  of interest to many here. Lobbying for what the OAI community
  needs from Schema will be much welcome. 


  Cheers,

			CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

	   W3C Workshop on XML Schema 1.0 User Experiences


The W3C is organizing a Workshop on XML Schema 1.0 User Experiences to

interoperability problems around the specification and its test suite.

  When:  21-22 June 2005
  Where: Oracle Conference Center, Redwood Shores, CA, USA

The full Call for Participation is available at:

Workshop Overview
-----------------

  This workshop will gather concrete reports of user experience with
  XML Schema 1.0, and examine the full range of usability,
  implementation, and interoperability problems around the
  specification and its test suite. Topics of discussion include, but
  are not limited to, the use of XML Schema in vocabulary design, Web
  Services description and toolkits, XHTML, XML Query, and XML Schema
  editors.

  Expected participants include schema authors, authors or users of
  public or standard schemas, developers and vendors of schema-aware
  code generators, schema-aware middleware, schema validators, or
  other schema-related software, and the W3C XML Schema Working Group.

  Desired outcomes of the workshop include:
  * A plan of action for addressing existing interoperability issues
    connected with XML Schema 1.0.
  * A plan of action for addressing existing problems with XML Schema
    1.0 through errata and clarifications.

  Attendees are encouraged to bring (or provide in advance, in their
  user experience reports):
  * Use cases and proposed guidelines to address them using XML
    Schema.
  * Tests (or real schemas) with interoperability issues, whether the
    issues are due to a lack of clarity of the XML Schema
    specification or to discrepancies in the implementations.

We look forward to your participation and contributions to this
workshop.
