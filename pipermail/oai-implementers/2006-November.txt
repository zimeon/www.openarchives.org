There's a few options I think.

A Python solution that was developed for my university library is available at 
http://www.infrae.com/download/oaipmh

PKP offers a PHP solution at http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=harvester

I currently have the stock DSpace serving public OAI-PMH and use a modified 
PKP one for some specialised harvest offerings for national projects. The 
oaipmh stuff is what we will move towards (already in use on some of our other 
systems)

Hope I understood your question and aim well enough and apologies for not 
responding sooner (had too many deadlines to catch).

hi,
i was wondering whether some sort of oai data provider auto-discovery
should be part of the protocol? the way this is done for
http://unapi.info/ seems pretty reasonable to me: just provide the
base url of the data provider as href attribute of a link element and
signal oai identifiers within the pages.
does that sound reasonable? if so, should it be part of the protocol
or rather an implementation guideline?

I totally agree. As a thought experiment imagine if PubMedCentral [1]  
search results had:

   <link rel="alternate" type="application/oai-pmh+xml" href="http:// 
www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/oai/oai.cgi">

and had marked up search hits like:

   <span id="oai:pubmedcentral.gov:13900">Comparison of written  
reports of mammography, sonography and magnetic resonance mammography  
for preoperative evaluation of breast lesions, with special emphasis  
on magnetic resonance mammography</span>

This would enable in browser applications and citation manager like  
Zotero [2] to query and use rich types of metadata from the oai-pmh  
server. Having an established and predictable way to do this as part  
of the specification seems like the right way to encourage  
interoperability.

hi Robert,

(Good to hear from you on this list)

I have 2 comments to the above:

(1) As you probably know, the OAI has just launched a new, 2-year 
technical effort named ORE aimed at increasing cross-repository 
interoperability; see <http://www.openarchives.org/ore/>.  Within that 
context, I personally (and I speak for myself) have doubts that it is 
appropriate to release new Implementation Guidelines (let alone change 
the OAI-PMH) in the short term, i.e. before the new project has 
delivered insights regarding the specific problems that it will try and 
tackle and regarding the solutions to consider.

(2) A facet of the problem domain that unAPI covers has been explored in 
other contexts.  A generic formulation of that problem could be (if I 
dare) "How to obtain (in an interoperable manner) a manifest of all 
available Representations of a Resource" (to use W3C Web architecture 
language). The parties that I know have explored this problem area (see 
below) have all used different ways to frame the problem, different 
operating contexts to explore it, and different approaches to tackle it. 
  This problem, as well as all the existing ideas regarding ways to 
approach it will almost certainly be on the ORE discussion table.  And, 
obviously I hope that the ORE group can propose an informed and inspired 
resolution.

A few pointers to explorations of this problem domain in our community:

(*) unAPI: <http://unapi.info/>

(*) DLF-Aquifer Asset Actions Experiment: 
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1045/october2006-cole>

(*) the Pathways Obtain service hinted at in our recent D-Lib paper 
<http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october06/vandesompel/10vandesompel.html>

(*) The "obtain" service environment described in Jeroen Bekaert's Phd 
thesis <http://hdl.handle.net/1854/4833>.

But see also the recent 
<http://www.w3.org/QA/2006/10/missing_http_feature.html> as an 
illustration that this issue is not only on the minds of our community.

Greetings

herbert

well, i'm aiming at something much lower: namely, how to get the baseUrl of
an OAI PMH data provider? and it seems particularly embarassing, that i have
no standard way to advertise my own service to people (including robots)
surfing my own pages.

just one more pointer to the use of autodiscovery in related contexts:
http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#Autodiscovery
and like opensearch auto-discovery helps browser extensions, oai pmh should
help browser based applications like zotero.

I think this depends a lot on what you're considering as the entry point 
to the service.

For example, it's trivial to link to the identify page and use XSLT to 
turn it into a user interface, as demonstrated by OCLC's repositories, 
amongst others.  Tom Habing has demonstrated the usefulness of simply 
linking to the identify page in his google search discovery technique 
for repositories.  So you have an easy way to advertise your repository 
as a whole. (See also OpenSearch's OSD, SRU's Explain)

However, by your reference to unAPI, I suspect you want a deep link into 
the repository for a particular item (like Ed's example)?  At which 
point I think the unAPI analogue breaks down -- unAPI gets you this item 
that you're looking at on the screen right now, whereas OAI is more 
geared towards getting you all of the items in the repository that 
you're after (by set, by date, by id, etc).  So in this case, why not 
simply use unAPI or OpenURL?

What I wouldn't like to see is further division of the environment into 
16 different autodiscovery links for any item. Already there could very 
easily be:  OpenURL (the *standard* for this sort of thing! ...), unAPI 
(... however there is much to be said for 1 page specs),  OpenSearch, 
OAI, SRU, AssetAction, etc etc. Plus I'm sure that the microformat 
people will invent their own sliiiiightly different versions of all of 
the above, and so forth.  Semantics are only useful when they're shared.

ok. to make things clearer, i'll describe my case at hand. when visiting the
pages of one of our journals  (http://www.livingreviews.org/), zotero is not
able to pick up much of the metadata. this is because the currently
supported mechanisms to get data - embedded rdf or dc xml - won't work for
pages delivered in html 4.01. on the other hand, we do have an oai pmh
interface, thus a perfect mechanism to harvest metadata. the only thing
lacking is a standard way to tell zotero where to find this interface, and
which identifiers to use for querying it.
you have a point in saying that unAPI may be better suited anyway. and since
we also do have a unAPI interface, we're all set as soon as zotero supports
this.
i was just wondering, whether auto-discovery (of the baseurl only) wasn't
worth including into oai pmh. and i think auto-discovery links are still
rather unobtrusive, even if there's 20 of them in the  head element of a
page.

regards,
robert

as far as i can see, this might solve half of my problem. i guess, the
applicable use case would be http://iesr.ac.uk/use/use-cases/usecase6.html .
i would still need to tell zotero which oai identifiers to look up, though.
but this seems like an unnecessarily complicated solution for this
particular case: the application - zotero - is already on my site, reading a
page, and is really just one 'link' away from the oai interface.
the reason why i'd prefer oai pmh to unapi in this scenario is the oai_dc
metadata format which all repositories need to provide, whereas with unapi
there is no such common format.

robert

Herbert and I talked about this some time ago and had a preference for
adding to robots.txt to inform crawlers about baseURLs.  At the time, few
outside of the DL community were supporting OAI-PMH, but perhaps it is
time to revisit this.  Here is the proposal; the syntax could be tweaked
w/ robots.txt "Allow:", HTML <link> etc., but this should give the idea:

===

OAI-PMH baseURL discovery

Drawing from our experience with mod_oai, we see at least 3 possible
ways for robots to "automatically" discover OAI-PMH baseURLs:

1.  develop a separate file, oaimph.txt, similar in spirit to robots.txt

2.  add to the existing robots.txt file

3.  use HTML link or META tags for robots

We do not prefer #1 - a separate file for robots to check seems unlikely
to encourage widespread adoption.

We prefer #2 because it injects OAI-PMH into the regular web
mechanics where it belongs.  Robots already look for this file -
why not put OAI-PMH statements where they expect to find guidance?

#3 can be used in some cases, but it makes an assumption that every
repository we would like a robot to find has an HTML presence.  #2 and #3
can be used separately since they address separate use cases.

robots.txt
----------

The "problem" with robots.txt is that the syntax is very simple and is
focused on telling robots what they can't do and not on what they should
do.  So in addition to having a line such as:

OAIPMHbaseURL=http://cs1.ist.psu.edu/cgi-bin/oai.cgi

We would like to expand the syntax of the "Disalllow:" tag to include
alternatives:

Disallow: /citations/   http://cs1.ist.psu.edu/cgi-bin/oai.cgi

Where the 2nd line is the alternate access for how to get at the
information prohibited in the Disallow.  Depending on how robust
robots are with respect to extended syntax, we could repeat the line
in case the extended line is not understood:

Disallow: /citations/
Disallow: /citations/   http://cs1.ist.psu.edu/cgi-bin/oai.cgi

HTML Tags for Robots
--------------------

It would be useful to tie an existing HTML page back to the original
OAI-PMH repository from which it came, such as:

http://uk.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502028


having something like:

<META NAME="ROBOTS" OAIPMHbaseURL="http://www.arxiv.org/oai2">

It would also be useful to tie the HTML representation back to
the structured metadata from which it came:

<META NAME="ROBOTS"
OAIPMHrecord="http://www.arxiv.org/oai2?verb=GetRecord&metad
ataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai:arXiv.org:astro-ph/0502028">

<META NAME="ROBOTS"
OAIPMHrecord="http://www.arxiv.org/oai2?verb=GetRecord&metad
ataPrefix=oai_marc&identifier=oai:arXiv.org:astro-ph/0502028">

This is similar to inverse of a DC.Identifier field -- instead of mapping
from structured to un/semi-strucutred, it maps from un/semi-strucutred
to structured.

Yes, I understand that now and my apologies for my unwieldy response 
that put the issue in a broader perspective.

If I am not mistaken, I think a major immediate aim that you have is to 
make your journal article metadata Zotero-extractable from your HTML 
pages.  In this case you might want to check out the COinS work 
<http://ocoins.info/>, by some of the same people who did unAPI.  If I 
am not mistaken Zotero eats COinS. The COinS stuff also integrates 
nicely with browser plug-ins to point to OpenURL Resolvers.

cheers

To my mind this is an argument for adding (or at least recommending)  
an autodiscovery mechanism for oai-pmh so that it can be shared.  
While it might sound insane, applications like Zotero and PiggyBank  
have embraced the notion that extractable metadata will be found in  
many different flavors and via different mechanisms...and that this  
is reality.

I was one (of many) folks involved in crafting the unAPI one-page- 
spec, and I think that it and COinS/OpenURL are certainly of use  
here. But at the end of the day it would involve some development  
work to make an oai-pmh repository available via unAPI (or any other  
protocol). Adding a <LINK> element to some HTML template file on the  
other hand would be a quick win...and doesn't require existing oai- 
pmh implementors to buy in to unAPI.

Given the deployment of oai-pmh in web accessible institutional  
repositories it would be an easy way of making repository metadata  
available to a whole new class of applications.

Michael says, "...we see at least 3 possible ways for robots to 
"automatically" discover OAI-PMH baseURLs..."

I don't understand why you don't include baseURLs specified within 
<friends> elements of a OAI-PMH response as another "way." Granted, this 
might be more of a p2p approach, but it technically *could be* a way for 
a robot to discover baseURLs.

This is how we're accomplishing "peer federation" in our pf-dspace 
project, in which dspace instances tell their peers the baseURLs of 
dspaces they know about by publishing lists of <friends> via oai-pmh.

i do think unAPI is a good fit, in particular because it can also be used
for non-xml formats like json; but as Ed pointed out, adding a link element
to point to the oai pmh baseUrl would be a quick win.

well, if I remember correctly OpenURL Resolvers can do more than provide
links to full-text. so I don't think they are a non-issue, honestly.  but
I agree that in many cases the full-text _is_ an endpoint. not in all
cases, however.

Thanks for your input, Robert.  I think we got your point.  As I
mentioned, I trust this will be discussed in the early days of ORE.

sorry for this oversimplification. COinS certainly are useful; and since we
already publish them for search results in our reference databases, it
should be easy to add them for the articles, too.

Thanks for your input, Robert.  I think we got your point.  As I
