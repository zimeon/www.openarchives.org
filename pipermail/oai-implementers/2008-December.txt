Hello All,

Where would I best report minor errors in the OAI documentation?

At http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#Datestamp
there's a misspelled word "arugment".

Dear List,

I'm working on the oai 2.0 implementation for the Berkeley Electronic
Press (which is an archive, not a harvester).  I'd like to verify
something about the spec, if you have a moment to think about it.  If
we get a request for:

verb=ListRecords&from=2008-11-20&until=2008-11-20

We implicitly treat the "from" as the start of the day, and the "end"
as the end of the day. e.g.  2008-11-20 00:00:00 <= date <  2008-11-21
00:00:00.  Is this correct?

The relevant spec is at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#Datestamp

Similarly "metedata".

The "from" and "until" parameters are inclusive so I think your translation to 
return all things with date portion 2008-11-20 is correct.

Cheers,
Simeon.

Hi Bryce,

Your typo reports finally prompted my to spell check the spec after all these 
years (I've felt guilty that we didn't do it at the time but never quite got 
around to fixing things). Now revised to correct the errors you point out and
other.

It makes me a little nervous to change such a stable document so I also added 
a set of links to various revisions in the "Document History" section so that
anyone can check what was actually changed.

Cheers,
Simeon
