Subject: [OAI-implementers] how can i do this?
Message-ID: <20050111053243.45919.qmail@web10808.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,
I am new to OAI. I am a student. I came across OAI when i was working for my class project. 
 
www.citeseer.com has a repository of research papers.  They have OAI collection and their harvest url is : http://cs1.ist.psu.edu/cgi-bin/oai.cgi
 
generally, we can search for papers by searching for keywords. Its time consuming to open each paper, find out if it is of any use and close it, open another paper and so on.
 
I am trying to write an extension for firefox browser. I will provide a text box where the user can type keywords and i wanted to write an application which gets the records of related papers. the records retreived should have the following format:
 Authorname, Abstract, LoacationURL, Year published.
 
so that i will add all results to a list box. when the user selects an item in the list, the abstract will be displayed in frame. the user can delete the item from the listbox if he does not find it interesting.
 
I dont know how to get the records, from the harvest url. I dont want to use database because the extension should be cross platform and if i use some databse application then the user should install that software on his local machine. 
 
how can i get the records in xml format? 
Is there any ready code for what i'm trying to do? 
 
Please help me regarding this.
 
Thank you very much,
Madhan

=A1=A1  When integrating metadata by OAI in a project of our library, we =
apply
Web services to envelop OAI interface. Maybe the main advantage of =
SOAP/Web
services/UDDI vs. HTTP/CGI is that the former provides a very easy =
method to
realize OAI. The Repository just needs define some functions and =
doesn=A1=AFt
consider the details of bottom protocol. And the harvester can apply the
interface just like using win API.=20

=A1=A1We found some other libraries also apply this method to realize =
OAI, but
have different forms. It may bring some troubles when using in wide =
scope.
In fact, SOAP/WDSL/UDDI can provide a complete set of functions for the
registry/realize/cite of OAI. Some other interoperability protocols like
Z39.50 (ZING) began its Web services trip years ago. So I want to know
whether there is a plan for soap/Web services/UDDI form of OAI.=20

Some discussion on this:
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2004-December/thre=
ad.html

http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-February/0003=
05.html

I don't think the situation has changed.

As a technologist I'm in favour of a SOAP version of OAI, as I think if
it's done well then most of the OAI code can be thrown away in favour of
SOAP APIs.

All the best,
Tim.
