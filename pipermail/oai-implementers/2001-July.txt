Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI protocol version 1.1
Message-ID: <3B3F7E38.94E7F47E@cs.cornell.edu>

dear all,

(appologies for cross-posting)

As announced, we are releasing version 1.1 of the Metadata Harvesting
protocol of the OAI.  This version is compliant with the W3C XML Schema
Recommendation of May 2001 (see primer at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-0-20010502/).

* Version 1.1 of the Metadata Harvesting protocol of the OAI is now
available at http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm .

* Instruction for migrating from version 1.0 to version 1.1 are at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/1.1/migration.htm .

* Details about the OAI strategy to phase out version 1.0 are at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/1.1/migration-strategy.htm .

The migration should really be simple. We wish you the best of luck with
it.

cheers

Carl and Herbert

you have to install LTXML and PyLTXML (from the Language Technology
group at Edinburgh - http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/xml/index.html)

then you need the source files from the W3C's CVS repository
(http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/xmlschema/)

and to run the checker you issue something like "python applyschema.py
<xml_file>"

good luck

	A quick question:

	What's the best way to handle "pointies" (greater-than and
less-than) inside record elements? If an abstract happens to contain a
phrase like "we studied the mating behaviour of horses at < 5 degrees
Kelvin", this can obviously stop the XML being well-formed.
	Currently we are encoding *all* character entities (including
ampersand, degrees sign etc.) as HTML entities. Is this right?

	Sorry if this has been discussed already.

Per the XML 1.0 spec (2nd edition, Oct 6, 2000) as maintained by the W3C,
the only pre-defined entities in XML are:

&amp;
&lt;
&gt;
&apos;
&quot;

All other [named] entity references must be declared.  This takes care of
your "pointies" (&gt; and &lt;) but obviously the XML pre-defined set of
named entity references is not as extensive as the HTML 4.0 set of
pre-defined named entity references.  The XML set however is extensible for
a given XML application (see below).

XML does intrinsically recognize numeric character references of the form:

CharRef ::= '&#' [0=9] + ';' | '&#x' [0-9a-fA-F] + ';'

as a valid way to refer to specific characters in the ISO/IEC 10646
character set (i.e., Unicode).  Thus it will recognize &#62; and &#x003E; as
valid character references for the '>' character.  If starting from scratch
you may wish to use numeric character references of this form in preference
to named entity references.

If you need to use named entity references for legacy or for other reasons,
then to conform to XML you'll need to include named entity declarations in
your XML application.  This can be done various ways, e.g., in an internal
subset in each XML document or by associating an external DTD containing all
the necessary named entity declarations with your XML documents.  We've
found that most XML parsers will accept DTDs that contain only a listing of
named entity declarations (i.e., you don't have to include element
declarations describing document structure) -- HOWEVER, we've not attempted
to include named entities (other than the 5 pre-defined for all XML) in our
OAI applications.  We've always used numeric character references.  I assume
properly declared named entities can be used in OAI context, but I'll defer
to Hussein or someone else who may actually have done this.

The internal DTD subset strategy ought to work for any non-validating
parser.  However the XML spec is unclear on whether non-validating
parsers are expected to process externally-referenced DTD's.

Just a quick example to illustrate the internal DTD subset strategy;
suppose you need to use a copyright symbol, which in HTML is &copy;
and in ISO-8859-1 is 169.  You could do it like this:

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='ISO-8859-1'?>
<!DOCTYPE myEntities [
  <!ENTITY copy "&#169;">
]>
<GetRecord ... etc ...
  ...
  <metadata>
    <dc ...>
      ...
      <rights>&copy; 1982 Fred Sneed</rights>
    </dc>
  </metadata>
 ...
</GetRecord>

hi

a few short comments on this entity question and schema validation ...

- internal named entities seem to work just fine

- one of the reasons we opted not to recommend named entities is because
of the fact that many XML parsers dont process external DTDs ... and
since this meant we couldnt use ISOlat1, etc. we went with Unicode
instead ...

- XSV currently supports external entity references as follows:
--- the external entity file must exist or the program crashes
unceremoniously
--- if the entity itself does not resolve its only a warning, not an
error

bottom line: unless all users of your OAI interface have the full
complement of popular entity files they may run into problems ...

suggestion: convert all named entities to unicode when generating OAI
responses (thats what i do)

have you seen the work done by CIMI ? (http://www.cimi.org/wg/metadata/)

Hi Alison and Hussein,

At the Getty Research Institute, we are investigating OAI and we are more likely to use VRA than CIMI... we will be delighted if we could work collaboratively to develop a schema based on VRA... The Getty has a long expertise in building metadata. The VRA itself is a some kind of spinoff from the CDWA (known as the Getty vocabularies and other standard authorities like AAT, ULAN, etc.).

Hussein, Alison,

Thanks for connecting us.

CIMI has built a Ver 1.1 Repository and expect to have a harvesting 
service done by the end of the summer.  Currently we support DC only 
but as part of the harvesting service development we are considering 
supporting a variety of other richer museum/cultural formats.  The 
first is a version of the SPECTRUM schema for rich description of 
museum objects.  We have been working with mda to develop XML schemas 
for SPECTRUM and the first versions (O.9) are about to be progressed 
into a CIMI testbed starting immediately.  This work is managed by 
Alice Grant out of the UK.

I'd be happy to discuss our work with the OAI if it's of interest to you.

Best, John Perkins

Note that the current OAI spec permits only encoding="UTF-8" (see section
3.1.2.1 Content-Type). The same could of course be done with UTF-8
encoding however.

I strongly support this suggestion. We are, after all, trying to promote
interoperability and using Unicode (UTF-8) seems to be a positive step
in that direction.

Thanks for the reminder, I had forgotten and was using ISO-8859-1.

Hussein, can you add an encoding test to the Repository Explorer?  I
have a repository sending back responses encoded in ISO-8859-1 and
it's passing the RE tests.

===================


WGL4 Fonts
        For the last several years Microsoft has been promoting a
character set regarded as a PanEuropean character set consisting of
some 652 characters. That is, this character set is far more extensive
than what we used to know as Latin-1 or Windows ANSI or ANSEL
character set. This is called the Windows Glyph List 4 character set
and includes many special characters, diacritics, and precomposed  
diacritics with characters.  It also includes Greek and Cyrillic.
WGL4 is a proper subset of UNICODE, and each of the characters is
known by its UNICODE codepoint.
        Fonts which are restricted to the WGL4 character set are much
smaller that 'full UNICODE' fonts and are therefore much less
cumbersome and tend to  make loading and display faster.  The WGL4 is
the defacto standard for all recent or new Windows computers, and,
going forward at least, most or all computers can be expected to have
all of the WGL4 characters automatically or off-the-shelf without
having to do  any downloads or special font installations.
        Each of the current versions of Microsoft's Core Fonts for the
Web use the WGL4 character set.  Core Fonts include Andale Mono,
Trebuchet MS, Georgia, Verdana, Arial, Arial Black, Impact, Times New
Roman, and Courier New.  These are  professionally designed and
carefully drawn fonts.  You can go to
http://www.microsoft.com/truetype/fontpack/win.htm
to check to see if your version numbers of these fonts are the current    
ones, and to download and install an upgrade if necessary.  Try Times
New Roman and Courier New for starters; the current version number on
each of these is v. 2.82.
        Try one or more of these WGL4 fonts in the ALA to UNICODE
mapping tests, either the browser one from yesterday or the Access one
from earlier today.  Get a sense for how many of the codepoints are
covered by WGL4.
        Jim Agenbroad has recently taken a look at a character set
analysis produced by my old JLGCHR program a couple of years ago. This
analysis covered only romanized data, not vernacular.  He went through
the character counts (where a character is either unaccented or is a
character-with-diacritics) to determine which ones are included in the
WGL4 character set.  That is, he was looking at the bibliographic
character set as it actually occurs in the data.
        Initial conclusion:  99.12% of the bib data is restricted to
the WGL4 character set.  Put another way, less than 1% of the bib data
needs characters that are outside of the WGL4 character set, and           
therefore less than 1% of the data requires anything beyond the basic
fonts that are standard on current computers.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Sample DCQ RDF via OAI
Message-ID: <3B4C8808.2049DB64@uiuc.edu>

Hi all,

We have developed a set of XML Schemas that will allow validation (at least
using XSV) of RDF files containing multiple namespaces, such as Dublin Core
and Qualified Dublin Core.  Our set of XML schemas consist of a XML schema
for RDF, plus several XML schemas for the various namespaces (like DC and
DCQ) to be used as properties and types within the RDF.  These other schema
all rely on importing the RDF schema (which can result in redundant imports
which is allowed by the W3C XML Schema spec, though not by beta version of
MS XML parser).  Our XML Schema for RDF was written solely to facilitate OAI
compliance when multiple arbitrary namespaces need to be combined;
therefore, its content models are fairly loose.  In any case, XML Schema is
not really adequate to validate complete compliance to the RDF Model and
Syntax spec.

To demonstrate use of RDF and multiple namespaces we have a sample OAI 1.1
provider site.  It can be accessed at
http://bolder.grainger.uiuc.edu/oaisimple1.1/oai.asp?verb=Document  The site
contains 53 sample records in two sets.  The idli:dimti:dchc records (50)
are fairly simple, using only RDF, DC, and DCQ namespaces, whereas the
idli:acm records (3) are more complex, invoking several additional
namespaces plus more complex RDF structures.  The metadata prefix needed to
access the RDF metadata is 'uiuc_dcq_rdf'.  We've run the site and most of
the records through the Repository Explorer to verify compliance with OAI
1.1.

Note that some of the idli:acm examples make use of the MathML namespace to
preserve mathematical constructs within content like titles and abstracts. 
We avoided having to create an XML schema for MathML by allowing in our RDF
XML schema a content model of "<xsd:any namespace="##any"
processContents="lax"/>" for any RDF property element. The value 'lax' means
that if a schema is identified for the namespace, the parser will attempt to
validate using that schema, but it will not complain if a schema cannot be
found.

Regarding our use of RDF: We followed the preliminary DCMI guidelines for
"Expressing Qualified Dublin Core in RDF" (still being redrafted).   We used
the May 3rd draft of this document, but we think we're still generally
consistent with the redraft released earlier this week
(http://www.mathematik.uni-osnabrueck.de/projects/dcqual/qual21.3.1/).  We
need to recheck URLs used for various DC Namespaces, but it looks like
convergence on this document is being reached (fingers crossed).  Please
keep in mind that conventions for expressing DCQ in RDF (and conventions for
using RDF in general) are still soft (RDF Model and Syntax spec is being
updated as we write this).  We think the examples we put together are
reasonable, but certainly they're not definitive.  Use them as a model at
your own risk.  (Much better to start with the DCMI redraft guidelines
mentioned above.  Better yet to wait?)

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Metadata Language Confusion
Message-ID: <sb4db1e4.068@salud.unm.edu>

Hi,

I'm beginning a project to implement an OAI repository that will contain citations to Latin American medical journal articles we are collecting. We are receiving these citations in three languages: English, Spanish, and Portugeuse. One of the goals of the repository, in addition to being OAI compliant, is that users will be able to do article searching and discovery in any of these languages. However, I am totally confused about how to represent this multilingual metadata in the OAI protocol.

I have read some Dublin Core material that addresses this problem, but those solutions all  seem to be rdf solutions or older metatag solutions. I would like to implement this as a qualifier of some kind, but that probably isn't a legitimate solution. The final solution I have thought of is to implement three repositories, one for each language, but that doesn't seem too elegant.

I am new to this, so perhaps I am missing something obvious. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

hi

well, im not sure if each of your records is in all three languages or
in one of the three languages ...

anyway, heres some quick thoughts:

firstly, i believe when you speak of your language problems you are
primarily referring to the language of the metadata (as opposed to the
language of the digital objects which can be encoded by using the
DC.language tag) ... in this case, what you really need is a way to
specify the language of the metadata record and as far as i remember
thats the reason for the "about" section of the record - information
about the metadata ... you could possibly do something like:

<record>
  <header>
    <identifier>oai:dummy:12345</identifier>
    <datestamp>2000-01-01</datestamp>
  </header>
  <metadata>
    <dc>
      <title>Rekenaar-wiskunde vir kinders</title>
      <description>Hierdie woorde is net om te vys dat alles nie
in             Engels moet geskryf word</description>
      <creator>Hussein Suleman</creator>
    </dc>
  </metadata>
  <about>
    <dc>
      <language>af</language>
    </dc>    
  </about>

some points on this concoction:
- af = Afrikaans 
  (and dont pick on my Afrikaans - im badly out of practice :))
- i have left out the namespace/schema stuff since this is just
illustrative
- english tag names and non-english text looks strange - i am presuming
this is valid - does anyone know why this is not the case ?

this would handle some kind of tagging model for each record being in
exactly one language ... if the records are in all 3 languages, you
should choose one to be the normative version (presumably the one the
article was written in) and disseminate that in response to an oai_dc
request ...

now, in general, DC is only the basic requirement ... i strongly suggest
using a metadata format for exchanging citation information which is
multilingual-aware ... as an example from another community, check out
the experimental ETD-MS format (Electronic Thesis and Dissertation
Metadata Set) ... in our case we have the same problem with documents
being authored in multiple languages and we have created a new format
which is basically DC with some extensions, one of which being the fact
that any tag may have the "xml:lang" attribute and may have multiple
instances (thus supporting multiple translations for any or all fields
in the metadata set)

[schema at http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/OAI/etdms.xsd, description at
http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/current.html and if you view the
VTETD collection in http://purl.org/net/oai_explorer you can check out
some live examples]

hope these comments help ...

Message-ID: <sb4e4d6b.055@salud.unm.edu>

Hussein,

Thanks for your response. The metadata itself is in all three languages, sorry if I wasn't clearer. I had not considered the "about" section of the record, I had been very focused on the metadata section and trying to come up with a solution that worked in there. The protocol documentation for the "about" section says that it is user defined and I wasn't aware of it's use for the dc language tag. That probably will work, but I am not sure how I would handle the normative version for distribution you refer to. 

One of the goals of the repository is to enable discovery in any of the three languages, if I only disseminate one of the versions than I may as well not repose (is that the correct term?) the other two versions as far as searching in those languages is concerned. Secondly, the criteria for determining which version to disseminate might also be a problem. Your idea of using the version that corresponds to the language of the original document seems natural, but another criteria might just as easily be which language would provide the most coverage for the largest base of potential searchers. English being the predominate language of scientific discourse would probably mean disseminating the english version.

It also occurred to me that, assuming I markup the records in all three languages, I am essentially tripling the size of my metadata record for any article no matter what scheme I use. Other than the language of the metadata, the information in two of the records is essentially redundant. In a world of perfect machine translation the whole problem should probably be handled at the service provider level. Records would be disseminated in their original language and service providers would handle the translation of queries from any language into the language of the metadata record, as well as translating the returned records into the language of the searcher. I don't think I will be able to wait for that solution though.


Finally, I had seen the "xml:lang" syntax in some of the Dublin Core RDF stuff I read, but I couldn't figure out how to use it in the context of OAI. I will take a look at your stuff tomorrow as soon as I get into work.

  For another set that is probably more geared towards electronic citation data
  is AMF, current draft is at http://amf.openlib.org/doc/ebisu.html.
  It is also experimental. It is aimed to be interoperable with OpenURL
  as will as OAI.

  That is the same approach as in AMF and it seems the way to go.

Jonathan,

I think multilingual discovery can be handled at the service level within
the existing OAI framework. Let me tell you how we are handling the
multilingual issue in Arc (we recently finished the implementation and
tested  for  English and German OAI compliant collections).

There are two major approaches you can take for building a multilingual
service provider. In the first approach translation of metadata is
maintained in all the languages. This reduces the cross-language retrieval
to its monolingual equivalent. In the second approach, the query is
translated to all other languages. Both approaches have been investigated
by several researchers. The first approach requires maintaining of
translated versions of all harvested metadata. For every English metadata
record, we have a corresponding German metadata record and vice versa. High
quality translated metadata requires prohibitively expensive human
translation. For this reason, we have taken the second approach that
requires only query translation.


For query translation we are using a Web based translation service along
with user assisted translation (we keep track of user selections in a
dynamic translation table). For illustration, consider user has entered the
keyword "Mobile" in the English unified interface.  Starting with this
query, we generate a query that will work for harvested metadata in German.
For translating the user-entered string, in this case "Mobile", we support
two options: user assisted, and default.  In the user-assisted option, the
user either enters the German equivalent of the term "Mobile" or selects
from a list of equivalent terms in German that are available in the dynamic
translation table. The dynamic translation table keeps track of all the
past user-entered translations for English terms. To start with, the
dynamic translation table may be empty or initialized  to a set of most
frequently used terms in the given domain. With time, the dynamic
translation table grows and will contain collective knowledge of the users
in the given domain.  The default option is invoked when the user decides
not to assist in translation. In this option, the translated term is picked
from the dynamic translation if it exists. If the term is not in the
translation table, we use a Web based translation service, such as:
http://www.freetranslation.com/. Note that in this case the quality of
translation will not be as good as what can be obtained by using the
dynamic translation table.

The multilingual version of Arc is still in trial version and we have not
made the URL public. However, if you are interested I can email you the URL
for trying out the system. Also, if you need more details on our
implementation, let me know.

Jonathan:

Some of the solution depends on whether the articles are each indeed in all 
three languages or whether it is only the titles and descriptions that are 
in different languages, and the article in one of those?

If this is the case, it should be possible to use the language qualifier 
for each title and description, and not necessarily have to create separate 
metadata records to do so. In DC, each of the elements is repeatable, 
partially to take care of just such a situation.  And as someone has 
already pointed out, much of the data is unaffected by the language issue.

If it were me, I would keep all the title and descriptive information on 
one article in one metadata record, and use the language qualifier (or 
not--it really isn't essential, if your goal is primarily indexing and 
discovery) to differentiate. Multiple titles and descriptions, so long as 
they're dealing with the **same article** should not be a problem.

Sorry for the cross posting.  I have have two specific questions, one for
the OAI General and one for the OAI Implementors.

We are creating a Digital Library of Science Education data, however we are
following a different approach than many digital libraries.  We are
targeting amateur astronomers and grade schools and places that will have a
small number (10 to 40) of data items.  They will run an out of the box data
provider package.  We will use OAI to harvest their metadata and provide a
web page to search all these smaller sites.  This was intended to have a
Napster-like architecture.

The problem is that being smaller, more informal sites they probably will
not be 24x7 systems.  In fact, we expect them to fail unexepectedly and go
offline frequently for potentially long periods.

The question for the OAI general is, should less reliable sites like the
ones we are targeting still register with the OAI data provider list?  Or is
there some implied quality of service with respect to uptime?  We need a
mechanism for giving each data provider a unique ID and the OAI Repository
Identifier would be perfect, but requires joining the list.

The question for the OAI Implementors is, we are creating a set of tools
specifically to deal with the unreliability of the sites.  We are using
using Jini to setup a dynamic registration and notification system.  This
way our service provider will get a list of all data providers THAT ARE
CURRENTLY UP.  Also, the servive providers will be notified if a data
provider comes up or goes down.  It will also be notified that a data
provider has changed its metadata and a harvest request should be sent.  Is
this toolkit something that would be of interest to other people/projects?

(http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april01/maly/04maly.html), the approach of
kepler is like:

1. We maintain a centralized registration server (LDAP).
2. Whenever user installs the unstable data provider( we call it
archivelet), the user will register a unique name in LDAP.
3. Whenever user starts/stops, archivelet will notify the LDAP server.
4. The service provider will periodically query the LDAP server, get all
the active archivelet list, and do the metadata harvesting, besides,
service provider will also cache full-text document.
5. The end-user could search service provider, get the cached full-text
document, or get the original document from archivelet if it's active.
6. The service provider is also a data provider too, and could register
it in OAI website (but archivelet won't). it could expose the
harvested metadata. However, it will assign new OAI identifier to
harvested data, thus it won't arise any naming conflict in OAI naming
space.

We are also interested in the "notify/subscribe" model as you mentioned,
basically OAI protocol is "pull" model based, your solution is like kind
of mixture of "push" and "pull" model, and there are probabaly another
pure "push" model- data provider sends its update to service provider
directly. It willl be very interesting to study the trade-off of these
approaches and their influences to OAI protocol. 



regards,
liu

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Metadata Language Confusion
Message-ID: <0107169953.AA995311571@router-8.camnet.com>


This is in response to a thread from last Friday regarding
multilingual metadata.

You may want to look into the approach we are taking in the Open
Language Archives Community (www.language-archives.org) where
multilingualism is built into the metadata set.  We are a subset of
OAI data providers who are supporting an OLAC metadata set in addition
to the required DC metadata set.  In the OLAC metadata set we are
following the approach Diane Hillman suggested in her response to this
thread. Since each metadata element is repeatable, we use an optional
lang attribute on each element to encode the language of the element
content (with a default of "en"). We also have that attribute on the
container element for the entire metadata element, but in this case it
takes a space delimited list of language codes, namely, all languages
in which the record is designed to be presented.  Service providers
may then use that information to customize the display for users.
(N.B., The container level list is not just the union of all language
tags within the elements, since a record in English, for instance,
could have a foreign language title, which may or may not also be
translated into English; such a record would specify only English at
the record level, since the whole record is not available in the
original language of the title.)

The lang attribute is explained in section 2 of our OLAC Metadata Set
document:

sorry to jump in late in this thread...  one possible soution that I have
not seen listed (if I'm understanding the problem correctly) is to have
sets along metadata language type, and allow the harvester determine which
language it would like.

since it appears that each record manifests itself in 3 separate records,
that might be easier than trying to keep them all bundled together.

or... (off the top of my head) even if the records are stored all rolled
together...  you might still support set-based language dissemination, and
discard the unrequested languages in your responses.  if the harvester
doesn't want language X, it might appreciate the bandwidth savings...

Message-ID: <sb55acc2.001@salud.unm.edu>

Hi,

I want to thank everyone for their suggestions about how to handle the multi-language metadata records. I  have been researching all of the material you have sent me with dogged enthusiasm :)

I tend to agree with Diane Hillman that it would be better to keep all of the metadata for one article in  one metadata record. Having separate metadata records implies to me that each metadata record is about a  separate article. And this is not the case. I will probably go with using the language qualifier for  multi-language elements. Some elements do not need to be translated (i.e. dates, authors,  etc.), so it's at least not as storage and bandwidth consuming as having a separate metadata record for each  language for each article.

In the long run, this does need to be handled at the service provider level. As others have pointed out the  storage, bandwidth and human translation costs with maintaining multi-language repositories is not practical. My problem is only a very small subset of the more general problem. I will be very interested in seeing how the multilingual version of ARC progresses.

Finally, the OLAC metadata set is interesting. It handles the problem I have although it is not  primarily designed for that purpose. However, another of it's design goals is how to handle multimedia material  and that is a problem I need to solve for some other repositories we intend to construct. I am starting to  do a lot of streaming media production and will probably use something like the OLAC construction to handle  that stuff. I am curious how this fits in with a thread here a few weeks ago that mentioned VRA and CIMI for the cataloging of multimedia data.

Thanks again for your help. If I can be of any assistance let me know.

 Hi there,

 What if I decided to have a format that would return full data rather than
metadata? We have a database of scientific articles which are stored as XML
(mean size 60KB) and rendered as HTML on our site. But what if I decided
that one of the "metadata formats" returned by our OAI interface was the
full XML of an article?

 Would a 60KB+ Record be likely to cause harvesters to choke? What other
implications (implementation or otherwise) would doing this have? Would
anyone use it? (Bear in mind these articles are open access, but still
copyrighted by the authors so you couldn't harvest them and use them
commercially).  Is this a sane thing to consider?

	Thanks,

data, metadata -- who can tell the difference?  ;-)

seriously, I don't think this is technically a problem.  in addition to
having a separate "format", you might also consider:

1.  partitioning using sets -- "metadata only" and "md + d" for example.

2.  having two OAI interfaces -- one for metadata only, and the other for
full data (the URI in the former could actually be a GetRecord verb into
the latter).  this approach is probably even better considering the IP
"restrictions" you have.

or some hybrid of these 3 approaches.

>

set your resumptionToken to be low (couple of records).  since
resumptionTokens are not required, harvesters ought to be able to handle
big responses.  and if they can't handle 60kb, that's not entirely your
problem.  on the other hand, a 6MB+ response might be rude.

I can imagine many SPs would want to do this.  I also expect many SPs to
do this even with non-XML data (i.e., PDFs) by getting the metadata
records and then immediately extracting the content from them.  For
example, the ResearchIndex and Southampton folks that focus on extracting
citations from the actual content might do this.

Michael

Ben,

I could not agree more with Mike Nelson's response to you.
The Cornell Digital Library Research Group (Southampton
partners) would also be interested in extracting references
and citation data straight from the text of the papers.

Southampton does arXiv and TeX and some PDF; Cornell does
HTML and XML and some PDF.

Ben,

I too agree with Michael and Donna and don't see a problem with exposing
a `metadata' format that is full-data. I see no technical issues and
think I'm perhaps (unusually) less conservative that Michael about
acceptable response size -- a few MB sounds okay to me.

In view of recent discussions on oai-general I think that careful
appropriate use / copyright statements and where they go might be
more of an issue. Perhaps we should talk more about `standard' ways
to use the <about> container.

Cheers,
Simeon.

But, obviously, if a data provider has full-content in a well-structured
format, he may as well consider exposing references in a preparsed
manner as yet another separate "information packet": doing so would lead
to 3 "metadata-formats" related to the same content: metadata, data,
references. As long as the xsd files that define those formats come with
some human readable information that explains what the content of
records rendered according to those formats is, this makes perfect
sense.  

If a data provider does not have the full-content in such a
well-structured format (or doesn't want to go through the hassle of
exposing the references separately), another party can indeed extract
references, as Donna points out.  Moreover, the latter party is then in
a position to expose those extracted references (amongst other to the
original data provider).  If it does so by maintaining the connection
with the original content from which the references were extracted (for
instance, by using the original oai-identifier as identifier for
harvesting the references) the door is open for some neat things to
happen.

Actually these ideas fit in well with the concept of using the OAI
protocol to establish an interoperable grid for a highly distributed
electronic scholarly communication system, which is a topic that I have
been speculating about at various conferences for some time now (see for
instance
http://www.library.tudelft.nl/iatul/Programme/Conference_programme/v_d__Sompel/v.d._sompel.html). 
Unfortunately I haven't found the time to write these embryonic ideas
down.

Hi -

	This thread is interesting to me because I have been thinking
about how to marry OAI and the Metadata Encoding Transmission Standard
(METS) (found at http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets).
	METS is an XML encoding that provides for various types of
metadata (structural, descriptive, provenance) and multiple encodings
inside each category (for example, a METS object could have both a MARC
and a DC descriptive metadata component). 
	What I like about METS is that documents can be in multiple
pieces, and the structural metadata can tell you how to put them together.
Also having data on how a document was digitalized and when is important
for assembling digital libraries.
	I was leaning toward using OAI only to return descriptive metadata
that pointed to a page that gave the user the option of downloading the
METS representation of the document, but I see that that question is
pretty complex.

Hmmm... the protocol is named the 'The Open Archives Initiative Protocol
for Metadata Harvesting".  Using it to harvest "Data" seems reasonably
non-intuitive to me, given this name.

I have no problem with the notion that one person's metadata is another
person's data.  It is a pretty extreme view to say that data in the form
of the full content of an article is metadata - which is what you appear
to be saying above?

I don't disagree that the protocol *could* be used to harvest data - I
just wonder if it *should* be used in that way.  Particularly at this
stage in the life of the protocol?

Can someone clarify the differences/advantages of harvesting data directly
using OAI vs. harvesting metadata using OAI followed by harvesting data
using HTTP based on the URL in the metadata?

I think it is important to emphasize here that so far I felt we had a
brainstorming session going on about the possibility of using the protocol
to harvest other types of content than only discovery metadata:  

* There was a posting about an idea to expose full-content.  This is an
idea that has actually come up several times before, and has even been
suggested by one or two publishers.  Their idea was that they wouldn't
object at all to expose an ASCII version of a full journal article using
the protocol, to allow service providers to index full-content for better 
discovery of their full-fledged full content.  

* There was a posting by me in which I shared the fact that in a few
presentations at conferences I have been "speculating" about the usage of
the OAI protocol for the harvesting of metadata of which the core purpose
is not discovery.  Actually, at the March Geneva meeting on peer-review we
had a workshop concentrating on the question whether and how certification
metadata could be harvested using the protocol.  At IATUL in Delft, Mr.
Steenbakker from the Royal Library in the Netherlands -- one of the few
world experts in digital deposit systems and digital preservation --  came
to see me after the session in which we both had a presentation.  For the
Dutch deposit system for digital materials, he is working within the
context of the Open Archival Information Systems specifications (as many
Europen national libraries do).  Mr. Steenbakker was inspired by the
presentation on the OAI protocol, and felt the protocol could potentially
play a significant role for syncing preservation-related metadata between
the several components of an OAIS environment.          


So, this is a long expose, basically to say that one can not keep people
from thinking and specualting about usages of the protocol beyond what
its orginal target area was when the OAI technical group created it.
Also, I don't see how other usages could be "illegalized", as long as they
remain compliant with the existing technical specifications.  

Having said all of that, I do agree with Andy's implicit suggestion that
the focus of our attention should remain in the discovery-area.  It is
there that we are looking for proof of concepts regarding the 
applicability of the protocol.  But, again, we can't keep peeople from
thinking and exploring beyond that.  

> Can someone clarify the differences/advantages of harvesting data directly

I think that the elegance of such an approach becomes evident only when
thinking of container-like content structures (for instance Michael
Nelson's buckets) in which a single "key" can be used to access many
different types of data: different types of metadata, references,
full-text, ...

Which brings me back to yesterday's METS posting.  From a quick reading I
haven't been able to figure out whether a unique key for a complete METS
package exists, i.e. I haven't been able to figure out what the glue is
that keeps descriptive meta, admin meta, file groups and strcutural map
together.  If there is such a key, then probably the OAI protocol could be
used to get to individual sections of a METS package.

	This was my concern,  - I can't see why returning full data would be
bad, in fact it makes a lot of sense from what Michael and Donna have said,
but it's obviously not quite the intention of the original protocol. Maybe
all that means is that the OAI should redefine itself as promoting exchange
of metadata *and* data ... But I wanted to discuss the implications before
deciding unilaterally that I would start doing weird things with the
protocol.

  One reason might be that the data is available in multiple formats.
  In our case, the URL used as an identifier is a link to an HTML article
which is rendered from XML. This version looks a lot better to humans and
the URL is, we think, the appropriate identifier for the article, but
obviously the HTML wouldn't be so suitable for processing as the XML
version. We also have PDFs. 
	Now we could provide multiple identifier URLs in the oai_dc record
to allow harvesting that way, I suppose - or is this a valid thing to do? It
seems to be allowed by the OAI Dublin Core schema:

	<element name="identifier"  minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"
type="string"/>

 but I seem to remember getting the impression from somewhere that you
should only have one identifier. Could someone clarify this?

I have a full text search and retrieval background, so my comments should be
heard in that context. I think it would be a good idea to include full text
for indexing purposes, thee more text the better the precision and recall
when performing a full text search. Of course this should be balanced
against network bandwidth at the source. I think it should made clear that
this text should be used for indexing only and not for display.

I think you should only have one identifier for a document. Document format
and identifier are very separate things. Multiple identifiers for a document
is going to cause confusion and separate identifiers for different formats
for a document are going to cause ever more confusion.

doing weird things with the protocol is encouraged ;-)

I see no problem in having the ability to return XML data through OAI.  It
won't work so well with, say, PDF data (or HDF, or MPEG, or ...), but if
it makes sense in your context, do it.  actually, we're all looking to you
to do it and tell us what the issues are!

I can't think of a *strong* reason why the data would have to come through
OAI...  unless you can imagine scenarios where the "metadata" and
"data" change independently and at different rates  (sensor data maybe?)

I can recall no restrictions to this...  it certainly makes things easier
for the SP if you have a single "wrapper" URI that encompasses all
formats, but that's not required.

wrappers, containers...  I'll take this opportunity to make a self-serving
plug for "buckets" ;-)

they may or may not do what you want...

I think you should not hesitate to experiment with full data export in
the way you suggest -- so long as you understand that it is an experiment.
It seems from reactions on this list that people will experiment with
harvesting your XML full-content.

The metadata focus of OAI must remain for the moment, not for any pressing
technical reasons but simply because it is politically much easier to get a
large group of archives to export of metadata than full-content.  Without
widespread support, OAI will go nowhere. I'm sure that there will, at some
stage, be an OAI-approved way to allow harvesting of full content but I
doubt that this will be compulsory (as oai_dc metadata is).

>   One reason might be that the data is available in multiple formats.

Yes, the whole issue of content-models (multiple formats, multiple parts,
etc) is avoided when we consider only metadata.

It is my understanding that having multiple identifier elements is
fine. The trouble is that there is no well defined way to say what
they mean. Note that by being an `OAI compliant archive', a data-provider
says that automated harvesting of metadata is permitted. It is not
implied that automated harvesting of full-content from URLs
specified in the identifier elements is permitted. It helps
if this is spelled out in the Identify response, e.g. in the e-prints
description section for arXiv:

    <metadataPolicy>
     <text>Metadata harvesting permitted through OAI interface</text>
     <URL>http://arXiv.org/help/oa/metadataPolicy</URL>
    </metadataPolicy>
    <dataPolicy>
     <text>Full-content harvesting not permitted (except by special
arrangement)</text>
     <URL>http://arXiv.org/help/oa/dataPolicy</URL>
    </dataPolicy>


Cheers,
Simeon.

It might be useful to point out here that Dublin Core identifiers are 
repeatable, and are not necessarily URLs. Other kinds of identifiers, like 
ISBN or ISSN numbers, for instance, are valid identifiers.  Confusion may 
well ensure thereby, but limiting to one identifier in this world is not 
realistic.  But it just goes to show that there's still no substitute for 
"knowing your data" ... ;-)

hi

always eager to add my 2-cents worth, here goes :)

metadata vs data:
who cares ? if anyone was at JCDL, you might recall Bill Arms saying
that we have as a community not yet proven the worth of metadata ... in
a similar vein, there are some researchers who tend to think of metadata
as merely a representational model or transformation of data ... i think
the bottom-line is that we want OAI to be used to convey useful
representations of the objects and do so in an efficient manner ...
right now, generally, the most useful data is title, author, etc. and it
is most efficient to transmit only the most discriminating of these
fields ... but in different contexts, usefulness and efficiency may mean
different things - hence the justifiable position to transmit full
content in XML-encoding form ... i fully support extending the
boundaries of the common definition metadata to experiment with meeting
the needs of specialized communities ...

as another suggestion, i have in the past advocated forming community
metadata sets with semantically well-defined links - not just simple DC
identifier URLs ... i think this would be another approach that may be
sort of a middle road

do remember that if your archive is registered publicly you should try
to be "nice" to people using your data - dont burden them with quantity
- its all well and fine to send 10000 large records in XML, but have you
tried parsing an XML document of that size ?

what are the semantics of OAI:
OAI-MHP is a protocol for transferring metadata (as loosely defined as
above) ... it is meant to be experimental and if we can do interesting
things with it, that will further justify its existence, promote its use
and contribute to the constant evaluation effort ... that said, i should
add that while most people are thinking about extensions, i have spent
the last 2 months actively building OAI-based Digital Library components
... my research focuses (among other things) around testing the
hypothesis that componentized digital libraries can be best served by a
common baseline model like OAI, and that with minimal changes we can
create "intraoperable" systems using "semantic overlays" for OAI (bear
with me for taking the liberty of creating a vocabulary to explain what
im doing) ... i am also testing the viability of the OAI protocol to
meet the needs of such an approach, and trying to determine what other
protocols would be needed to complete the picture of what i have begun
to call the "Open DL Design" within the framework of OAI principles
(Herbert, sorry about using Open one more time :))
i cannot point to any reports yet but within the next few months i will
probably try to get some of this published as well as making available
drop-in OAI-in/OAI-out modules that act as search engines, browse
engines, filters, converters, etc. ...

dc.identifier:
about the identifiers, please note that as Simeon pointed out, the DC
identifier field does not have specific semantics ... i think issues are
being confounded here ... the OAI identifier is the one in the header
and that is very particular - as far as i remember, the DC identifier
isnt even required !

well, thats it for now ... if my perspectives are too radical, please
just ignore them ... i have scant respect for the establishment - id
much rather push the boundaries since these are after all our home-grown
boundaries and if we dont push we will never know if we got them right
in the first place :)

Message-ID: <200107262052.QAA25146@orca.cisti.nrc.ca>

Hi,

I have a question, which will perhaps reveal my nascent knowledge and
in this area:

OK. Let's look at an example <usage> metadata (from the 1.1 spec):

Example 1:
<usage>
    Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the OAI
    identifier remains attached to it.
</usage> 

Yes, I can understand the content of this. But when my harvester goes
out and gets 10 million OAI metadata records, I am not going to go
through all of them by hand to figure out what their usage
is. However, if I want to be able to legally present my harvested
metadata, I DO want to be able to differentiate different usages
(public domain, resticted to licensed users, etc...). But the present
OAI does not seem to let me (easily automatically) do this (unless
this can be buried in a DC qualifier...). 

What would be useful would be a numerical attribute for usage, which
would act a a look-up for a list of values maintained by someone. For
example: 

Example 2:
<usage code="1">
    Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the OAI
    identifier remains attached to it.
</usage> 

This code value would be absolute, i.e. I could write applications
which could use the code value to drive it. Also, although I can read
the above usage content (example 1), if it were written in Russian or
Maori i would not be able to understand it. 

The table could look like this: 

Code   Meaning
0      Public domain
1      Metadata may be used without restrictions as long as the OAI identifier remains attached to it.
2      Available only to Cornell staff and students
3      Available only to licensed users of Elsevier journals
4      Available only to licensed users of the Elsevier journal "Computers & Geosciences"


Now this "solution" is rife with many problems: who maintains the
list; the codes will not be mutually exclusive, but this may not be
obvious; and it is starting to look a little like SFX. 

I may be missing something important here, so please illuminate me...

thanks,

	glen

I would agree that a free text field about rights to metadata is not useful.
I expect that a few levels could probably be made to work, although I'd stay
away from rights to the object pointed at.  That doesn't seem like where OAI
should be concentrating.

On the other hand, why are you publishing the metadata if you don't want it
used?  The best way to control rights will be by who you let into your
server and if it's a public server it would seem there is an expectation
that it may be consolidated by others into larger catalogs.

If this is indeed the case, then why have a usage tag at all, if
everyone is assuming that all the metadata is public? It becomes
rather meaningless. I personally do not think this is the case,
otherwise we would be limiting the protovol and by extension, the
metadata publishing and consuming communities.

Hi,

It might be interesting to see how web crawler/robot works, search engines
like google traverse the Web automatically, and there is not something
like "right" level which restricts what crawler can do or not.

But there is a Robots Exclusion Protocol,
http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html , by this protocol, "A Web site
administrator can indicate which parts of the site should not be vistsed
by a robot, by providing a specially formatted file on their site, in 
http://.../robots.txt. Note that these methods reply on cooperation from
the Robot, and are by no means guaranteed to work for every Robots."  

If we assume it's difficult to specify appropriate "right" level in oai,
probably we just let data providers have the right to "disallow/allow"
specific service provider.

regards,
Liu

Hang on, isn't the "usage" tag defined in the e-prints about schema
and not in OAI proper?  And so this discussion only pertains to
archives using that schema, right?

I hope so.

  As an example, the RePEc community would be unhappy to have the data 
  sold or included in a product that is sold.

  In that case, you are out there with Liu's suggestion that you should
  enter into bilateral aggreement. That strikes me as a bit bureaucratic
  but it may be necessary to avoid abuse. 

  I was the first to propose a legal framework for the exchange of 
  metadata at the Santa Fe meeting. I was also the first to experience
  serious abuse of my community's metadata. Despite that, I have somewhat
  changed my mind about the legal issue in the OAI context. I believe
  that it is too early to judge a legal framework right now. It is best
  to visit the issue a few years' down the line, when we have more 
  experience with the kind of setup that we are creating. Until then,
  we can deal with problems if and when they occur. IMHO that is better
  than setting up a structure that prevents problems but adds to the cost
  of protocol uptake.

All:

As you know OAI requires that Unicodes be used when needed.  So I have been
looking in the web for a comprehensive mapping of character entities to
Unicodes, and of the characters themselves to Unicode.  Does any one have
any idea where I could find this?

Thanks,
Jose

Though not quite on the same subject, I spent some time today looking into
bad UTF-8/XML exported by OAI data providers. I found the following
tables useful in finding out where the bad characters came from:

Windows 8-bit (codepage 1252) -> Unicode
  ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/WINDOWS/CP1252.TXT
Mac Roman -> Unicode
  ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/MAC/ROMAN.TXT
Local advice from Tanmoy Bhattacharya:
  0x0B (illegal in XML) is TeX for \ff, as in effect
  0x7B ( { ) is TeX for \endash, as in Leonard--Jones

Cheers,
Simeon.

The 'about' container within an OAI record can be formatted according to
whatever schema you like.  In the RDN implementation of OAI [1] we use DC
metadata in the about section.  So we can (and do) put a human-readable
rights statement about our records into the dc:rights element in the
'about' container.

It seems to me that there are three areas for consideration:

A) providing a human-readable rights stamenent about an OAI record

B) providing a machine-readable rights statement about an OAI record

C) enforcing compliance with either form of statement

A) can be achieved thru the use of dc:rights as described above (or
equivalent). In practice, this isn't actually very useful (because we want
machines to be able to deal with this kind of stuff for us and, in any
case, people aren't in the habit of looking for such a statement or
reading it!!).

B) can be achieved by delivering a richer machine-readable rights
statement.  I guess this could be done by putting an ODRL [2] statement in
the 'about' container - though I haven't looked into this in any detail.
Doing B isn't perfect, but it means that cooperating software should be
able to 'do the right thing' - it works at the same kind of level as
robots.txt on the Web.

I don't know how to do C) other than at the human-to-human level (possibly
with lawyers in the loop)!!
