Subject: [OAI-implementers] harvester tools
Message-ID: <D794C1D2-DA78-11D8-B0DE-0003934CA344@umich.edu>

Hello all,

We are investigating switching to a different harvester tool and 
thought that a good first step would be to poll this list about their 
use of harvesters.

If you harvest OAI records:

1. What harvester tool do you use? Version number?

2. Are you pleased with the tool? What do you like and not like about 
it?

Please send responses directly to me and I'll summarize for the list. 
(Anonymously if preferred.)

Thanks,
- Kat

The only people who need to read this are harvesters of records from LC
(lcoa1) in the MODS format -- which may be the empty set.

We intend to switch our MODS records from version 2 to version 3 of the
MODS schema (with new datestamps).  Will anyone be inconvenienced by 
replacement (rather than having both versions in parallel)?  The records
(as now) will be created dynamically by transformation from MARC, using
the transformation mounted by LC at
  http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/MARC21slim2MODS3.xsl

  We can consider other transition strategies if this will cause problems.

Greetings to all.

We are just getting our feet wet at USC with OAI. I was hoping to get some feedback.

What do you all do with the data that your harvester is collecting? I see two main options; Use the xml, keeping it in xml and using the xml as your data source (ie XML Indexing Engines) or massaging the data into some kind of relational database and using that as your data source.

Would anyone that cares to please share exactly what they do?

Thanks for any feedback provided.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI compliant data provider for Plone or Zope?
Message-ID: <16642.57314.578450.225454@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

Hi everybody,

we are building a kind of a PloneFarm for a big Brazilian Science
Foundation (Fapesp). The idea is that we have projects, like in
SourceForge (actually we are also running a Gforge server, integrated
with the Plone service), and that each projects receives a full Plone
site to develop its home page. If anyone is interested to have a look,
please visit these URLs:

  Home page of the web service, under beta-testing right now
  http://incubadora.ansp.br

  Project Plonetarium (software implementing the Plone interface)
  http://plonetarium.incubadora.ansp.br
  
  An international community dedicated to discuss Museums
  http://forumpermanente.incubadora.ansp.br
  
  A group dedicated to translate a Python book published under GNU FDL
  http://pensarCCpy.incubadora.ansp.br
  
  A germ of a wine encyclopedia (the beverage) built with a wiki,
  trying to emulate wikipedia's functionality 
  http://eBaco.incubadora.ansp.br
  
I am sorry to say, but all the documentation, as well as the projects
themselves we have so far, is in Portuguese :-(

Anyway, this being a Science Foundation, where the service is to be
used by the research projects being supported, the idea of having a
built-in OAI compliant data provider came up a couple of days
ago. Each project would upload their publications on their own page
and fill out the corresponding OAI meta-data for each
publication. Then the server could either just make available all the
meta-data of all projects in an OAI compliant way or it could also
provide a unified vision of the whole digital library, including
comprehensive searches, comprehensive browsing etc.

Well, my question is this: does anyone know of some existing software
for the Zope and/or Plone platforms which could either implement or at
least facilitate our implementation of these ideas?

Is there an OAI compliant data provider (like eprints or Dspace or
CDSware) implemented on top of Zope or Plone?

I would appreciate any information you might have to help us.

I just want to add that all the software involved in the project is
free software.

Cheers,

Imre Simon

I'm not sure if this will be of use to you, because it is not an OAI 
data provider per se, but I am currently working on an OAI harvester in 
Zope/Silva for a customer of ours, the Erasmus University of Rotterdam, 
(Silva is an open source content management system, developed by Infrae, 
for which I work.) The harvester itself can collect all (or only 
selected) data from any number of OAI servers, and is independent of 
Silva. A Silva layer is used to present the harvested data in a 
user-friendly way, but I think it shouldn't be that hard to write your 
own presentation layer in vanilla Zope or something like Plone. This 
would help you to get existing OAI-data into your Zope-site, but would 
not be of use to you if you wanted to have a real OAI-Data provider 
written in Zope. Building that would not be that hard either, but I 
don't think it's on our short term to-do list. (It could be put there of 
course ;) The OAI-Harvester code will be released as open source, once 
it is in a stable and usable state, at the latest before September. If 
you (or anyone else) is interested in learning more, or having a look at 
the code while it is in a somewhat less stable state, contact me.
