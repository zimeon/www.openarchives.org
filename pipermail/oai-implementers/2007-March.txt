Subject: [OAI-implementers] Granularity in Identity and Responses - must
	they match?
Message-ID: <10EEADDAD601FA4D83DF79F3281B8CF6224612@ISSVEXBE1.staff.aber.ac.uk>

Hi,

A quick question. Apologies in advance if it is covered in the specs or
the guidelines, but I couldn't find anything about it.

My question:

If the Identify response gives:

<granularity>YYYY-MM-DD</granularity> 

then do all other responses (responseDate and record header datestamp)
have to be to this granularity, or can they be expressed with a higher
granularity?

Thanks,


Stuart

Hello, 

As the best of my knowledge the Identify/granularity means
the highest granularity that can be used either
1) in the from and until arguments of ListRecords or
ListIdentifiers
2) in the datestamps of the records.
Smaller granularity can be used of course.

There is no any connection between 
1) the granularity of the response date given by the server
in all OAI response headers and
2) the datestamps used in the records. 

Best,
Tamas

Dear all,

Thanks for your replies.

So, to clarify:

1) If in the Identify response <granularity>YYYY-MM-DD</granularity> is
given, the following is invalid:

<ListRecords>
 <record>
  <header>
    <identifier>oai:cadair.aber.ac.uk:2160/24</identifier> 
    <datestamp>2006-07-10T15:21:22Z</datestamp> 
    <setSpec>hdl_2160_22</setSpec> 
 </header>
 ...

Instead datestamp should be 2006-07-10.

2) However, at the top of the response,
<responseDate>2007-03-14T14:41:11Z</responseDate> is expected (rather
than 2007-03-14).

3) The granularity of datestamps in the metadata is not linked to the
granularity of the provider.

Thanks,


Stuart

Dear all,

today in my institution we had a long discussion about the 
implementation of an OAI interface and the possible dangers of OAI: how 
to prevent denial-of-service-like numbers of harvester requests?

What experiences do you have with such things as OAI doesn't have any 
precaution to prevent something like this? Did you ever experience 
problems for your servers or are there any measures we could implement 
and which we have overlooked?

Best, Torsten

If someone follows the protocol you can throttle OAI requests using 503 
responses (see: 
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-repository.htm#FlowControl). 
We use this at arXiv but hope to get rid of it soon as we change our 
infrastructure to allow us to support OAI more efficiently. Answering OAI 
requests should be quite cheap.

If someone doesn't follow the protocol then you are, as always, left 
monitoring the logs and adding a rule to your firewall in extreme cases. I 
don't think there will ever be any way around that.

Cheers,
Simeon

On our server for Virtual Collections (not yet publicly announced, but 
waiting only for a content switch setup), we have some code to delay 
responses by a few seconds if traffic gets too heavy. No more than a 
specified number of requests will be answered in a given time period; 
the others will be queued up.

This is intended mostly to prevent impact on other services which 
involve more direct human interaction, but also has an eye toward 
denial-of-service attacks. If legitimate traffic gets too heavy for 
short periods, that's a friendlier response than 503.

If your using Apache 2.x you should make mod_cband your friend. You  
can throttle your harvesters with it.
