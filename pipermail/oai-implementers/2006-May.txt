I'm not sure I understand your question properly. However, I think it 
would be reasonable to assume that any repository that exposes only day 
granularity datestamps is not updated more frequently than daily. I'd poll 
at most once a day (for which you specify a 'from' parameter equal to the 
previous day -- one increment of overlap is necessary to ensure nothing is 
missed).

(As an aside, it is amazing to see how many RSS clients poll arXiv.org 
very frequently when we do include the standard headers saying that we 
update daily and give a time. One might have hoped that these headers 
would increase efficiency but that does not seem to be playing out in 
practice.)

Is there a currently-supported turnkey OAI harvesting package that folks
can recommend?  I want to harvest a number of repositories and aggregate
them into a single search interface.  I'd also like to do as little
wheel-reinventing as possible.

Hi Ed,

We are about to release a completely redeveloped version of the PKP 
Metadata Harvester (http://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-harvester/). Features will 
include:

-Ability to harvest OAI metadata in a variety of schemas (will come with 
uDC, MODS, and MARCXML).

-Flexible search interface that allows simple searching and advanced 
searching using crosswalked fields from all harvested archives. Advanced 
searching of archives that share the same schema will be possible using 
fields as defined in the schema. When creating crosswalks for searching, 
admins can define elements are text, date, or HTML multiple select 
interface widgets.

-Ability to perform granular harvesting using setSpec and timestamps.

-Ability to perform post-harvest and pre-indexing 
filtering/normalization on metadata.

-Ability to theme user interface and add plugins for extending 
functionality.

-Searching is highly scalable (creates an inverted index for searching).

We're just finishing up some last minute internal testing and 
documentation (technical document and administrator's guide). I'll post 
to this list when it is available, which should be by the end of this 
month. The Harvester is a PHP application with a MySQL backend, and we 
are working on adding postgres support.

Hi Edwin

Knowledge Integration Ltd (www.k-int.com) maintain a complete open source
(GPL) solution to your requirement.

It is a portal solution which aggregates OAI data sources and presents them
for searching under a single search point (It also allows inclusion of
distributed resources (e.g. srw, sru z39.50). Harvests are re-executed
incrementally at a user defined intervals.

It is used in a variety of projects in the UK including the UK wide peoples
network discover service (www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/discover). This
aggregates numerous cultural OAI feeds for the UK Museums, libraries and
archives and presents them alongside live searchable targets in a single
search interface.

Drop me a line off list if you would like more info.

Hope this helps

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Bad Argument 'resumptionToken'
Message-ID: <2f2b62f2f2ad9d.2f2ad9d2f2b62f@ryerson.ca>

Hello everybody:

I am trying to harvest some data from the Pubmed Central.  I make the
following request:

http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/oai/oai.cgi?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

I receive the following resumption token:

<resumptionToken>oai%3Apubmedcentral.gov%3A14546!!!oai_dc!</resumptionToken>

When I try and use the token as follows:

http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/oai/oai.cgi?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&resumptionToken=oai%3Apubmedcentral.gov%3A14546!!!oai_dc!

I recieve the following:
  <error code="badArgument">Bad Argument: 'resumptionToken'.</error>.

Any help would be appreciated.

Tim

Do not repeat any of the parameters except for the verb and 
resumptionToken.  Get rid of the metadataPrefix, something like this:

http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/oai/oai.cgi?verb=ListRecords&resumptionToken=oai%3Apubmedcentral.gov%3A14546!!!oai_dc!

Thank you Tom and everybody - At work we are trying to write a program
to harvest some of this data.  I'll ask again if I have any more problems.

Cheers!

Subject: [OAI-implementers] JAVA UIUC Harvesting Tool
Message-ID: <44731A13.50709@ifremer.fr>

Hello,

I am developing a specialised OAI Harvester. I then try to install and 
configure the JAVA UIUC Harvesting Tool Version 2.0 B5 available on the 
sourceforge.net WEB site.

During my tests, I found a few bugs in this release. Since the 
University of Illinois does not seem to support this product any more, I 
would like to know if some of you are using this tool. If yes, could you 
please tell me your experience with this tool?

Thanks for your help,

Kind regards,
Fred

Hi Reme,

No HTTPS URLs are validated/registered via the OAI site. The way the 
OAI-PMH protocol is currently written, HTTP is mandated.

There was a rather inconclusive discussion of whether OAI-PMH should allow 
HTTPS last year:

http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2005-February/001416.html

The consensus I saw was that harvesters should not be forced to implement 
HTTPS, which implies repositories should always support HTTP. Hence I 
still validate only HTTP baseURLs. Of course, I have no control over the 
use of parallel HTTPS versions.

I forward this to the oai-implementers list to see if there are more 
opinions.

Cheers,
Simeon

The LOC Z39.50 site [1] lists an OAI/Z39.50 gateway, and links to [2]
(dated March 2003).  However, this latter site doesn't seem to exist
any more.  Can anyone tell me if there is an OAI gateway to Z39.50, or
better still, an aggregation service over libraries [3] that exposes
oai_dc records?  I'm aware of WorldCat, but it looks like there's only
a one-directional flow of information from OAI to WorldCat.  Thanks
