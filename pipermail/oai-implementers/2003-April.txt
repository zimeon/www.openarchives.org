Hi Thomas,

It is not a problem of your document; if I remember right, this happens
because of conflicting classes feeling responsible to do the parsing.
(I think from xalan or saxon).
Xerces worked for me again after I had installed the newest java by sun
and by removing any unneccessary classes from CLASSPATH. (maybe there are
some old ones in jre/lib/ext?

You can also download xsv directly and install locally. It works very
well.

Greetings, Heinrich

Hi everyone,
=20
just this week someone from my firm tested my OAI implementation and he
sent me a report with the results.
What he did was give my program some terrible input with things like
set=3Dnon_existing_made_up_set or from=3Dvery_illegal_date
The protocol isn't being very specific about the arguments that are
returned in the header (in the request node I mean).
What I did was just return the the arguments that mattered (for each
verb) the way they came in, resulting in invalid output in these cases.
=20
Should I check for each of these if they contain any illegal stuff? If
so and I would skip any illegal ones, the output wouldn't match with the
input anymore.
You could for example get error code=3D"noRecordsMatch" due to an =
illegal
date, but in the output you wouldn't see that date anymore.
=20
I think the solution to this kind of problem would be a check before
sending the request to the repository. But than again, you just might
still be left with illegal input.. so omitting those things in the
output looks like the only right solution.
=20
Any thoughts on these matters?

See section 3.2 in the protocol spec, bullet point 3.

You must include the arguments of the request as attributes of the
<request> element of the response if the request did not generate an
error.

You must NOT include the arguments of the request as attributes of the
<request> element of the response if the request generated a badVerb or
badArgument error.

(The spec does not appear to be specific on the case when there is an 
error or exception which is not badArgument/badVerb. However, that doesn't
matter for the present discussion because in that case the arguments will
be schema-valid.)

The harvester SHOULD only send sensible parameters but the repository must
be able to sensibly handle bad requests.

Hi,
i'm starting with OAI-PMH. I studied a lot the docs existing in the OAI's

hi Luis

if you already have a collection of metadata and/or data using digital 
library software such as EPrints, DSpace or Greenstone for 
management/access, then you must look at the documentation for that 
software for how to activate the OAI interface.

if you already have a collection of metadata and/or data, but the 
software to manage/access the collection is largely home-grown (e.g., a 
bunch of Web scripts/applications) or does not already support the 
OAI-PMH, then you or a developer of the software needs to write code to 
implement the OAI-PMH specification for your collection - the spec is on 
the OAI website and isn't too complicated to get up and running if you 
know a bit about Web applications.

if you have the metadata and/or data but aren't using any software to 
manage it, then may i recommend looking at EPrints (www.eprints.org) and 
Greenstone (www.nzdl.org) as possible candidates. there are lots of 
other packages, but if you want a widely-used standalone package with 
OAI support, these may be a good starting point. alternatively, look at 
the OAI website and you will find little tools to make 
"mini-repositories", e.g., the "OAI Static Repository" for repositories 
that don't change over time and the "XML File-based Repository" for 
repositories where each metadata object is a single (usually XML) file.

lastly, if you have neither the data nor the software already, i suggest 
that you determine the requirements for your repository, and then adopt 
an existing package (e.g., EPrints, Greenstone, DSpace, CDSWare, 
GaneshaDL, ...) to manage your digital library.

...

now if you need help on how to write code for an OAI interface, i would 
suggest looking at the tutorials that are available on OAI-PMH. if you 
go through the OAI's website, there is an older article by Simeon Warner 
linked from the "Documents/OAI-related papers" page. (if someone has 
newer material, please post links). i also have slides from last year's 
JCDL tutorial on practical implementation of the protocol - these can be 
found at:
   http://www.dlib.vt.edu/projects/OAI/index.html#reports

hope this info helps.

ttfn,
----hussein

ps should we have something like this - maybe a flowchart - in the FAQ?

Set up a Wiki and it would be relatively easy to create as questions 
crop up, e.g.:

Q1. Are you adding OAI-PMH support to an existing repository system, or 
creating a repository from scratch?

Yes [Link to next q.]

No [Link to next q.]

...

As an aside, I found Simeon's tutorial very useful - perhaps he could 
re-visit it for OAI 2?

All the best,
Tim.

We have a wiki site dedicated to eprints/OAI questions. It is almost
empty right now but it is planned to be a companion site to an
institutional eprints server we are installing (and which also is
almost empty right now). This wiki is going to run in Portuguese
mainly but if you think it might be helpful to develop the FAQ alluded
to, please feel free to use it at will. Even if it is just for an
experiment or as a temporary test site.

The eprints server is here:

  http://eprints.ime.usp.br/

The companion wiki is here:

  http://www.arca.ime.usp.br/coruja/wiki/

If you think this is a good idea, please let me know. We will make the
necessary changes to the Home Page so as to announce the FAQ in
construction (in English).

Suggestions are welcome.

Hi all,
   These questions may be very basic but I am a
beginner. So please bear with me.
   I am following oai_dc XML Schema for displaying
metadata of any Record in GetRecord or ListRecords
response. There is 'identifier' element both in header
and metadata of Record. So what is the difference
between identifier element in header and identifier
element in metadata ? Also, what are the elements -
Type, Format in metadata ?
Thanks,
Venu.

Identifier in the metadata is a Dublin Core identifier, identifier in 
the header is a unique identifier within your repository.

Dublin Core is a list of unordered, repeatable string values (although 
you should use proper URIs, ISO dates etc. where applicable).

See the Dublin Core docs for what Type, Format, etc. are:
http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dces/
(Dublincore.org seems to be down atm so I can't check that's the 
description doc ...)

e.g.
Header.identifier = "oai:myrepos:uniqueid10"

DC.identifier = "http://www.myrepos.com/item/10"
DC.identifier = "oai:myrepos:unique10" (i.e. you could also include the 
OAI identifier in the metadata)
DC.identifier = "New Order Journal, V202 30-40"
DC.type = "Text"
DC.format = "text/html"
DC.date = "2002-04"
and so on ...

All the best,
Tim.

The identifier in the metadata is the identifier of the resource being
described - it is often a URL for the resource.  The identifier in the OAI
header is the identifier of the OAI 'item' (essentially the identifier of
the metadata record(s) about the resource).

Note: the correct URL is

  http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/

dc:type indicates the 'genre' of the resource (text, image, ...).

dc:format indicates the something about the 'digital manifestation' of the
resource (e.g. the way it is encoded).

I would recommend that dc:format should be a MIME type (for digital
resources) and that you consider selecting the value of dc:type from the
DCMIType vocabulary at

  http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/

Repeat dc:type to indicate other (more specific) genres if necessary.

I tend to to disagree with this.  The OAI identifier is *not* an
identifier of the resource being described - it is an identifier of the
OAI item - therefore it shouldn't be repeated in the DC description.

Finally, if you are describing eprints, then you might want to take a look
at

  http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/docs/simpledc-guidelines/

for some DC usage guidelines.

At the risk of being pedantic :-)

This is referring to the oai-identifier scheme, rather than the more general
OAI identifier (unique within a repository and a URI).

"An item is conceptually a container that stores or dynamically generates
metadata about a single resource in multiple formats", so it follows that
the identifier for the OAI item uniquely identifies the resource, which
fulfills the DC definition:
"An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given [OAI] context."

What is not defined is how to resolve an oai-identifier to the resource, but
DC doesn't require that.

All the best,
Tim.

Well, I still tend to disagree :-).  I assume that you are refering to

  http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#Item

and below...  I quote:

 Note that the identifier described here [the item identifier] is not that
 of a resource .  The nature of a resource identifier is outside the scope
 of the OAI-PMH.  To facilitate access to the resource associated with
 harvested metadata, repositories should use an element in metadata
 records to establish a linkage between the record (and the identifier of
 its item) and the identifier (URL, URN, DOI, etc.) of the associated
 resource. The mandatory Dublin Core format provides the identifier
 element that should be used for this purpose.

The item identifier is not the same as the resource identifier - because
the item is not the same as the resource.

One of the ways we think about the two different identifiers is this:


The DC identifier is an identifier for the RESOURCE.  In fact, our rule
of thumb is that any information within the metadata tag is about the
RESOURCE.

The OAI identifier is an identifier for METADATA for the resource.  And
again, information in the header tag is about METADATA for the RESOURCE.
We tend to think of the about tag as being about the METADATA as well.

hi Venu

i am not sure about your first question - are you looking for usage 
statistics for oai-harvested data ? if so, every now and then service 
providers publish whatever they do know on this list or oai-general 
(sometimes as pointers to publications). there is no global tracking for 
usage of harvested data.

the trivial answer is that for most service providers, 100% of accesses 
is to oai-harvested "metadata" since they get their data strictly from 
data providers. i dont know if anybody tracks "resource" usage however.

for the second question, there are two ways to harvest: either by using 
listrecords or by using listidentifiers and getrecords (there are 
probably numerous articles/papers that discuss these). it can be argued 
that the former is all we need, but listidentifiers has been used by 
some harvesters for periodic consistency checks - to confirm existence 
of records without retrieving them.

... if you provide more information on your requests, you will probably 
get more directed responses ...

ttfn,
----hussein

One of the advantages of OAI-PMH from the point of view of some data
providers is that they don't need to know exactly HOW their metadata is
being used.  However, I do check a few particular sites.

OAIster
  http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/o/oaister/ 
and the UIUC Cultural Heritage Repository
  http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/oai/search

harvest the metadata records for digitized historical materials that the
Library of Congress (LC) makes available.  

A Sheet Music Consortium hosted at UCLA
  http://digital.library.ucla.edu/sheetmusic/
harvests LC's set of records for digitized sheet music.

These service providers all harvest and index the records and link
to the resource as mounted at LC.

The OAI protocol does not itself support the harvesting of the underlying
resources, and whether or not it is permitted will depend on the
repository.  LC has one arrangement with another institution that involves
harvesting the records and then use of the records to facilitate
harvesting of resources outside the protocol.

On possible uses for the ListIdentifiers request:  

1.  It can be used to count records, which can be useful in 
scheduling harvesting of the records themselves.

2.  I proves useful for LC as a data-provider for verifying batch
additions or set membership.

3.  I had always assumed that very selective harvesters might harvest a
set of records, filter the set in some way, and retain a list of
identifiers for the items in the subset.  This list could be used to
control re-harvesting.  Whether any current harvesters are doing this I
don't know.

    I hope that helps.

Message-ID: <20030414155021.37958.qmail@web40502.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,
   The OAI says that 'resource' is the object or stuff
that metadata is about. So, can resources include
multiple types ? For example, in our case, I
identified research projects as resources. But later I
found that harvestors would like to search our archive
based on certain other things like Author, his Papers
etc. This would mean I should consider Authors, Paper
titles also as resources along with research projects.
So, when a harvestor asks for ListIdentifiers, can I
display all of these (Research Projects, Authors,
Paper Titles) ? Or should I use different
metadataPrefix for different resources ?
Thanks,
Venu.

I'd say the answer is no, you don't want to do that. OAI isn't a search
protocol, it's a simple harvesting protocol. If you really do need to search
your database by these fields you will need to use a different protocol such
a Z39.50 or SRU/SRW and use it to index those fields from your research
project records. Also keep in mind that the main reason people make your
metadata records available via OAI is so others (aka service providers) can
make them useful and searchable in this way.

Basically, it sounds like you want more functionality than OAI alone
provides. Check out EPrints or DSpace if you need a more complete archiving
solution.

I agree with Jeff and feel that overloading the selective harvesting
mechanisms (sets, metadata formats) with search functionality is not the
best way to approach these issues. You should either use a protocol that
supports remote search, or provide that functionality at the service layer
(think of the OAI repository as one layer down).

Cheers,
Simeon.

Thank you. As you said, Could you inform me how I can
provide this at the service layer ? I have already
implemented the OAI considering these research
projects as Resources. But it would be of good use to
my organization if I can extend it to considering
certain other things as Resources. My initial idea was
to use the same oai_dc metadataformat as schema for
all these resources except that I will use only some
of those elements in metadata of these different
resources. For example, I need creator element of
oai_dc for project but I dont need that element for
Author etc. This way I would omit certain elements for
these resources. Please suggest me if this is
practical.
Thanks,
Venu.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI Resource
Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE98342DB7@OA3-SERVER.oa.oclc.org>

I don't see how titles deserve to be separate resources, but I can
sympathize with your desire to store authors as resources. For example, I
have an old copy of the LC Name Authority File available that is accessible
via OAI GetRecord verbs (e.g.
http://alcme.oclc.org/laf/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=m
arcxml&identifier=oai:laf.oclc.org/LCCN/n78-95332). So, you can retrieve any
record in the file by substituting the LCCN for that person at the end of
the URL.

The biggest problem with this from OAI's point of view is that you can't
honestly represent these records in Dublin Core (e.g.
http://alcme.oclc.org/laf/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=o
ai_dc&identifier=oai:laf.oclc.org/LCCN/n78-95332). Is "William Shakespeare"
the dc.creator? The dc.title? Dublin Core is a bibliographic metadata
format, and people just aren't bibliographic items. On the other hand, I
don't claim that this repository is OAI compliant. It's just a convenient
way to make the MARC21 XML data available to both browsers and automated
processes.

If you're really intent on creating records for people, you might consider
doing something similar. Then, in your research records, you can create
links from the dc.creator/dc.contributor/dc.publisher, etc, to these records
via the available URL.

This brings up another problem, though. There is no place in the Dublin Core
schema to put these URLs. For example,

<dc:creator>Shakespeare, William,--1564-1616</dc:creator>

To get around this, the ETDMS format, for example, extends the Dublin Core
schema to include a resource attribute.

<etdms:creator resource="http://...">Shakespeare, William...</etdms:creator>

If you store your research project records this way, you can always dumb
them down to Dublin Core by omitting the URL.

If you do decide to store records for people, I'd suggest that there's no
good reason to mix them in with your research paper records. Also keep in
mind that various groups are dealing with schemes that will associate people
with URIs, so in the long term, you may want to pick a solution that will
allow you to utilize these services when they become available.

Venu,

I guess I misunderstood about making "titles" a separate resource. After
re-reading your note, I see that you're referring to storing information
about research papers in addition to research projects. This would be a
perfectly reasonable thing to do. You could differentiate the two by putting
them in separate sets. Pick and choose Dublin Core elements according to the
qualities for each type. If Dublin Core cramps your needs, you can always
support a richer alternative format such as MARC in addition to DC. I think
my earlier comments regarding people still apply, though.

Jeff,
Thank you for your responses. 
Currently, the set hierarchy in our repository
consists of different research SUBJECTS. So, Is it
possible, I mean practical with respect to OAI, for me
to include Paper titles, Authors also as OAI Sets (set
hierarchy) along with research subjects ?
Thanks,
Venu.

Venu,

I agree with the earlier respondents.  OAI-PMH is a mechanism for
exchanging (but not searching) metadata.  If your local application needs
to hold and support searching for information about people, that is likely
to be outside OAI-PMH entirely.  However, if you are also looking to
exchange metadata about people among applications/services, you may be
able to use OAI-PMH.

Useful metadata about people (whether you call them authors, agents,
parties, or whatever) is going to be different from useful metadata about
document-like information resources.  Even though the DCMI now says that,
'Here an information resource is defined to be "anything that has
identity".' the original elements (used for the OAI mandatory set) were
definitely developed for "document-like" objects.  Squeezing information
about people into an unqualified Dublin Core record is unlikely to be
useful.

As Jeff points out, since OAI-PMH allows you to use other metadata
formats, you can use it to exchange records that describe people if the
parties involved in the exchange can agree on a format.  The mandatory DC
record can be minimal, its only useful purpose being as a conduit to a
"full" record in a more appropriate schema.

Apart from MARC Name Authority Records in the marc21 "slim" schema, I am
not familiar with an XML Schema in common use for describing people.  I
just found 
  http://www.numerata.com/vcardschema.htm
but vCard may not have the elements that are of interest in your
application.

There are at least two more activities that I can think of that are
looking into records for people.  However, neither has reached the stage
of having a schema, as far as I know.

1.  DCMI Agents Working Group
 http://www.dublincore.org/groups/agents/
"Agents" include Creator/Contributor (and possibly Publisher) from the
primary DC Element Set.  

2.  InterParty 
 http://www.interparty.org/
The InterParty project is funded under the European Commission's
Information Society Technologies Programme (IST), to design and specify a
network to support interoperability of party identification (for both
natural and corporate names) across different domains. InterParty builds
on the work of the <indecs> project, one of whose deliverables was a
specification for a Directory of Parties
[http://www.indecs.org/pdf/DirectoryofParties.pdf]. InterParty is not
proposed as a replacement for existing schemes for the identification of
participants in the intellectual property domain (e.g. national library
name authority files or systems oriented towards the needs of rights
licensing) but as a means of effecting their interoperation.
 http://www.interparty.org/

If you really are looking to exchange records about people, perhaps others
on the mailing list know of projects involving appropriate schemas or
element sets.

Venu,

Yes and no.

Yes in the sense that you could create sets hierarchies that look like this:
Subject:History:European:Middle+Ages
Name:Shakespeare,+William,--1564-1616
Title:A+is+for+Apple

No in the sense that no one will ever use your sets if you do this. Take the
"Name" hierarchy, for example. Even if someone did want to harvest only
those records written by William Shakespeare, they would still have to match
the set string exactly (i.e. "Name:Shakespeare,+William,--1564-1616") or no
records will result. If your setSpec has two dashes separating the name from
the date, one dash in the request won't cut it. The user doesn't know the
birth and death date? Sorry. The same goes for the "Title" hierarchy.

Your target audience might get some value from the "Subject" hierarchy, but
only if it's not too complicated. In general, I wouldn't create OAI sets
unless the folks harvesting it demanded them. Why make it hard on yourself
if nobody cares?

Other than a simple set of subjects, I only see two other sets that OAI
clients are likely to care about: Type:Projects and Type:Papers (or
something similar).

If you want your users to be able to do useful searches by title, subject,
or author, though, don't expect OAI sets to satisfy them. Find some other
way to give them this capability such as Z39.50 or SRU/SRW or EPrints or
DSpace.

Hi all,

Hopefully, we've sorted out all the OAI-PMH issues with DSpace for the next release of the system.  The Unicode problems should be fixed, and we now support resumption tokens.

We've put up a beta version, and would really appreciate it if one or more people could have a go at harvesting it to make sure any problems are ironed out.  The data is not 'real' data so you probably won't want it to show in your end user's searches!

Hi.

I am in the beginning stages of architecting an implementation of OAI 
that will provide user-specific access to our archives and was wondering 
if anyone knew of any other projects that have tackled this issue.

As far as background information, we are an archive with about 400 
journal titles and millions of records.  Users will only be able to 
harvest metadata for those journals that they have subscribed to - that 
should be a problem I can handle.  Things get tricky when we start to 
look at what is available WITHIN the journal.  Some users will have 
access to the entire journal from start to finish, other users will only 
have access to records up until a certain year (usually 5 years before 
the present year).  This isn't so hard to manage either, until you start 
to think about a user asking for new or changed content.  What is "new" 
or changed will be different for each harvester, depending on their 
access rights.

One possible solution to this problem is to simply give them the 
metadata and flag it as being unavailable in some way, but this is not 
an ideal solution.  An ideal solution is to restrict access to the 
metadata until such time as they are permitted to harvest it.

Well, I don't expect anyone else to have encountered this specific 
problem, but if anyone has experimented with limiting access to an 
archive for specific users or user-groups, I would love to know about it.

Thanks!

  In the OAI model, users do not havest. Service providers 
  harvest. Users use service providers. Service providers
  (or intermediate collections such as RePEc) will need to
  have whole set of metadata, irrespective of end users,
  because if they have no subscription, they have no data
  to start to provide a service with. Service providers
  will have to warn users that content access may depend on
  them having a subscription. BTW, RePEc already includes
  JSTOR links. Richer metadata from JSTOR would be much 
  welcome. In particular, we would be interested in 
  full-text links for various types of full text, and
  in classification data, and precise citation data, as
  precise as you have captured it.

Hi,

If I understand your problem as follows (e.g.):

An article in Journal "XML Matters" appears in 2003. User "John" has
complete access to the journal and harvests the article in 2003. User
"Daisy" has access only after one year, so in 2003 is harvesting articles
from 2002. But when Daisy asks for new articles in 2004 she won't get the
article from 2003 because she is using the datestamp ">=2004".

I think the solution to this is to change the datestamp in the user's OAI
request to be datestamp-(user's period before access), e.g.
In 2003 Daisy requests all records >=2003 - (1 year delay) = return all
records >=2002

Before any records are returned to the user you will need to check their
rights to that record (in a journal they are subscribed to, date of the
article appropriate to their subscription).

I've written this as I've worked it out, so please excuse any mistakes!

All the best,
Tim.

To handle access rights for the content stuff is probably beyond the scope
of metadata harvesting (see also below)

I do not think this is an optimal solution.
Nobody will know that there is some important information out there, but
one is just unable to access the content.
Nobody will ask you then how this information might become accessible.
You should share the metadata, but possibly restrict access to content.

You can easily restrict access to your Data-Provider on HTTP level, by
using e.g. IP restriction-based access. You can also restrict the use by a
password (.htaccess for Apache..).  The URL is then e.g.
http://user:password@www.myarchive.org/oai?verb=.... in order to access
the Data-Provider.

One possible solution is to create virtual repository for each user (the
institutional subscriber), such as http://an.org/{userid}/oai, since
automatic URL mapping can be used, this task may not be very hard. For
each user you may have a profile which maintains access right.

Michael 

There are two sides to this problem. The first side is access control:

- You can use IP based restrictions, and map those IP addresses to a set of
rights. This has the drawback that the harvesters could not be switched from
one machine to another without an intervention on your part.

- You can use standard user name/password (using .htaccess) and map those
user names to a set of rights. This is a little more flexible but a little
more insecure.

- You could use user name/password over an SSL connection, again mapping
those user names to a set of rights.

The second side is below:

Personally I would not expose metadata to which the users have no right to
unless they can easily get those rights, ie buy the article. I have been
very frustrated in the past when using systems, only to be told that I could
not have the article and there was not way for me to buy it.

But if there is a simple way for users to buy an article on your system, you
might want to consider making all the metadata available to give users a
choice in search service for searching the material. This would be of
interest to me as I run the myOAI search service (http://www.myoai.com/).

In the past I built a system called ScienceServer which had a subscription
component which did just that. Each user/institution was assigned a set of
subscriptions and all they saw were what they paid to access. This allowed a
consortium to maintain a single collection, serving individual members of
that consortium a virtual collection of the journals they had subscribed to.

This is complex but quite doable, and if you are looking for a consultant to
help you with this, I would be more than happy to do so.

Hi all,

Thanks to all for your input - it is very nice to get worthwhile 
feedback so quickly!  I realize that access restriction is beyond the 
scope of the OAI standard, but it is unforntunately a messy part of life 
over here. 
I'm not so interested in the how of access restriction, ip recognition, 
controlling rights, etc. - these things I can handle.  The interesting 
part to me is managing this huge metadata repository in such a way as to 
provide the metadata I want a user to see given the constraints of the 
OAI standard.

I will try to address some of the questions you all have raised:

1)  Mr. Krichel made some comments about service providers and 
subscriptions to JSTOR.  JSTOR actually has more user groups than just 
service providers.
We also deal directly with Libraries (who may want the metadata to 
create their own search engines), Publishers (who will want the metadata 
for an entire run of a journal and have no
access restrictions at all), and other business partners who want access 
to our metadata.

Having such diverse groups with varying technical skills raises a number 
of issues - among them is how can we get the user the metadata that only 
they want/need and what are the implications in regards to OAI selective 
harvesting rules.

2)  As far as sharing ALL our metadata - this would greatly simplify my 
life in regards to this issue, but it is a business decision that is out 
of my hands.  I would still restrict by Journal, so users would only get 
metadata for those journals they subscribe to, but I would let them see 
ALL content for that journal including content that is not yet available 
on the public site (usually due to agreements with publishers).  These 
records could be flagged as "not yet publically available" and 
consequently screened out by the end user. 

There are two major problems I see with this approach:

a)  Metadata has some inherent value to it.  What's stopping someone 
from providing links to other content providers using our metadata to 
point to other providers?  Perhaps this question could be worked out in 
a legal metadata sharing contract.    I said before this is a business 
decision that is out of my hands for now...
b)  Users may not want to screen out large chunks of content that they 
can't yet see.  I'm already worried about the technical barriers that 
using OAI may provide for some of our less technically inclined 
partners, this might further complicate the process for them.

Yeah, yeah...information wants to be free...I know that song and dance.  
It certainly would make life easier, but I'm not sure it makes good policy.,

3)   Do I have this right that the "creation date" for a given object is 
subjective?  That is, does the creation date refer to the date that this 
object became available to repository for that particular user?  I'm 
guessing yes. 

If this is the case, we can potenially do some behind-the-sceens 
spoofing of the creation date to reflect the time that this record 
became available to the user.  We would aslo have to spoof the modified 
date in the same way, so that no record had a modified date older than 
the creation date.    This would be a fairly complex process and would 
require us to maintain information about what a user was able to see at 
a given point in time.  It would also require us to gather data about 
the record such as the published date (this is how we restrict access) 
and the date the record was publically released.  A difficult problem, 
but not impossible.

4)  The virtual repository idea is interesting, but would likely be 
unmangeable if we start getting large amounts of users when are dealing 
with millions of records.

Thanks to you all - I really appreciate your help!

hi

some late comments:

firstly, i think we should address a philosophical/theoretical issue 
that is hinted at by this problem. OAI-PMH is based on the premise that 
interoperability can best be promoted by shifting the "implementation 
burden" from the data providers to the service providers - making those 
who have a greater desire for interoperability pay the costs in terms of 
complexity. JSTOR appears to offer precisely the inverse scenario to the 
classical data/service provider split. if i am reading the thread 
correctly, JSTOR is the driving force behind this interoperability 
effort and, by my understanding, should therefore centrally handle the 
complexity and offer subscribing libraries the simplest possible 
interface (OAI-PMH?).

that said, in the ideal case, a subscribing institution should get a 
cohesive view of their subcollection, independently of other subscribers.

how could this work in practice?
- do you need virtual data providers? i am not sure this is necessary - 
you should be able to use IP- or some other authentication and determine 
what data to make visible transparently
- do you need to store additional data for each harvester? i hope not, 
as this will break some of the basic idempotence properties of OAI-PMH. 
if each record in your archive has "published" and "modified" dates, you 
could screen for accessible subsets on the basis of matching the 
published dates to subscription rules (on a per access basis of course), 
while allowing date-based harvesting on the basis of modification dates 
(with the provision that modification = max (modification, 
subscription)) ... i hope this makes sense :)
- unsubscriptions are going to be tricky! if you expose metadata 
differently for different users, "deletions" may become a nightmare, so 
if possible i would suggest looking into not using the PMH's deletions 
feature.

in any event, i think it is doable with an appropriately structured 
database, with a not-too-complex set of subscription rules and without 
additional storage or per-harvester data.

ttfn,
----hussein

You aren't returning any records for your set:

Only a resumptionToken. The clue is in "(header+,resumptionToken?)", which
is regular expression speak for match header 1 or more times, match
resumption token 0 or 1 times.

You should be returning a noRecordsMatch error if there are no records that
match the OAI query.

To sum-up: Every OAI response should either be an error, a complete list, or
a partial list (records+resumption token).

All the best,

I noticed that, but I really don´t know what could be wrong.

My guess is that even though we implemented a table with the sets, and each
record has a set, they are not implemented correctly...

It is legal to have a set which contains no items. It is just 
that (as Tim pointed out) the response in this case must be
a noRecordsMatch error.

Hi everybody,

I just implemented the output of my oai server by transforming our own
xml format to for example dublin core (each supported output format
having it's own .xsl stylesheet), however, in the transformed xml MSXML
has replicated the dublin core namespace for each dc element:
<dc:title
xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Walangara</dc:title> 
Where it was:
<dc:title>Walangara</dc:title> 

My question is, is this a problem?
Hussein's repository explorer does NOT complain about this, so that made
me feel a little confident.

Cheers,
Jozef Kruger (Adlib Information Systems B.V. the Netherlands)

Jozef,

I've encountered the same problem. If I remember the incantation properly,
you need to re-specify the dc namespace in the template as you are doing the
transform. For example:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> 
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
version="1.0"
                xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
                xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
                exclude-result-prefixes="rdf">
  <xsl:output method="xml"
              indent="yes"
              omit-xml-declaration="yes"
              encoding="utf-8" />

<xsl:template match="/">
  start creating your OAI wrapper here
  <xsl:apply-templates match="rdf:RDF"/>
  close your OAI wrapper here
</xsl:template>

<xsl:template match="rdf:RDF" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
  <oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/"
    xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd" >
    <xsl:apply-templates select="dc:*"/>
  </oai_dc:dc>
</xsl:template>

<xsl:template match="dc:*" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
etc.
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

I think that was the trick, but my memory may be faulty.

Jeff

hi

(disclaimer: i use xsltproc and not MSXML so this 'may' not work)

after looking at Jeff's comments, i wonder if maybe you did not declare 
both the "oai_dc" (from OAI) and "dc" (from DC) namespaces. for example, 
when i write stylesheets to transform into dc, i usually start with:

<xsl:stylesheet version='1.0'
  xmlns:xsl='http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform'
  xmlns:oaidc='http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/'
  xmlns:dc='http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/'
  xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
  xmlns:source="whatever"
 >

then the actual transform starts as follows:

<xsl:template match="source:root">
    <oaidc:dc 
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ 
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd">
       <dc:title><xsl:value-of select="source:title"/></dc:title>
    ...

hope this is useful. if you want to see some similar stylesheets, there 
are a few like this included as examples in the XMLFile package (linked 
off the OAI tools page).

ttfn,
----hussein

Thanks for your tip too, it doesn't work in MSXML, it prints all
namespaces that are "active", so adding the oai_dc namespace to the top
only made things worse (that namespace was also added to each element).
Just to let you know :)

cheers,

Hi Jozef,

Technically from an XML standpoint it is not a problem, but it is a terrible 
waste of bytes.

I think I've run into this problem with MSXML previously also.  If I 
remember correctly I solved it by using different ways to create the output 
elements.  In XSLT you can create output elements either by inserting the 
element literally into the XSLT, such as the oai_dc:dc element below:

<xsl:template match="/">
   <oai_dc:dc>
     <xsl:apply-templates/>
   </oai_dc:dc>
</xsl:template>

Or, by using the the xsl:element tag, as shown:

<xsl:template match="/">
   <xsl:element name="oai_dc:dc">
     <xsl:apply-templates/>
   </xsl:element>
</xsl:template>

If I remember correctly, by mixing and matching which technique I used to 
generate the output elements, I was able to eliminate the extraneous 
namespace declarations.

Try using the literal technique <oai_dc:dc> for the root element, but the 
<xsl:element name="dc:creator"> technique for the child elements.

If after some experimentation this doesn't seem to work either, I could go 
and maybe find some of my old stylesheets to see exactly what I did.

Regards,
	Tom

Since I'm not a list member, a colleague copied me the email below
discussing metadata for people... I recently completed a review of
metadata schemas for describing people, for the UK PORTAL project, which
is available from:

http://www.fair-portal.hull.ac.uk/deliverables.html

It includes vCard (as mentioned by Caroline below) amongst others.
