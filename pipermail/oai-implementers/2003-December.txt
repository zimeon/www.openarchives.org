Subject: [OAI-implementers] "info" URI update
Message-ID: <3FD34B16.F1253B8F@lanl.gov>

Hi All:

Following our announcement of the "info" URI scheme a couple months back
[1] we would like to notify the list of a revision to the I-D which has
now been posted on the I-D repository [2]. The revision targets three key
areas which further simplify the "info" URI scheme as a facilitator for
referencing information assets:

      a) "info" now excludes any dereference capability
         Consequence: no resolution systems are to be associated with "info"
URIs

      b) "info" now includes support for full hierarchy
         Consequence: the identifier component of an "info" URI may include "/"
chars

      c) "info" now includes support for URI fragments
         Consequence: secondary resources may be indirectly identified by "info"
URIs

Additionally, three other changes have also been made:

      d) The BNF now reuses many of the RFC2396bis productions
         Consequence: facilitates comparison with future generic URI syntax

      e) Some of the examples have been changed for simplification
         Consequence: removes possible confusion with other works in progres

      f) Section 7 "Rationale" has been improved
         Consequence: clearer justification why "info" URI scheme is required

Together with this new I-D we are pleased to announce that an early
implementation of the "info" URI Registry is now available online at the
"info" website [3]. The namespace registration records are human/machine
accessible and can be harvested using the OAI-PMH protocol [4].
Alternative disclosures of registration records using e.g. RSS may be
made available at a future time.

Two additional documents are also made available on the "info" website
[3]:

      1. A comprehensive FAQ which answers common questions re "info"
        (Follow the link <About "info" URI> on the menu bar)

      2. An "info" Registry policy document
        (Follow the link <Registry Policy> on the menu bar

Please note that both documents are currently evolving and are being made
available at this time for discussion purposes. They should not be treated
as authoritative but will be improved through comments received. [Also
note that the link to the I-D on the "info" website points to the previous
version ('-00'), not the current version ('-01') - we will amend this.]

We would like to invite feedback on the Registry and associated documents
and any comments on the revised I-D.

One particular question we have regards the use of the BNF productions
from the draft RFC2396bis [5] rather than from the reference RFC2396 [6]
itself. The reasons are twofold: i) we would like to futureproof this
specification, and ii) the "segment" production in RFC2396 is overly
restrictive, and has now been generalized in the work ongoing in the
successor to that RFC. We believe this is the correct approach - and seems
to follow the approach taken in the IRI work [7].

For those of you running harvesters on both UTK Libraries and UTK
Sunsite repositories, I've gathered a list of the oai identifiers of
records available via the Sunsite repository that have since been
reworked, corrected, expanded (etc.) and made available via the UTK
Library repository. (Sunsite provided our testbed.)

  If you would like to avoid duplication within your harvested records,
this should be of interest to you:

Message-ID: <20031211223310.GA27937@chloe.inkdroid.org>

A bit of news about the Net::OAI::Harvester CPAN module.

In addition to the standard 6 verbs, Net::OAI::Harvester v0.94 [1] has 
two new methods listAllRecords() and listAllIdentifiers() which provide
seamless resumption token usage:

    my $harvester = Net::OAI::Harvester->new( 
	baseURL	=> 'http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/oai2_0' 
    );

    my $list = $harvester->getAllRecords(
	metadataPrefix	    => 'oai_dc',
	set		    => 'lcphotos'
    );

    while ( my $record = $list->next() ) { 
	print $record->metadata()->title(),"\n";
    }

It should be making it's way around CPAN [2] mirrors right now.

This is the first time I've written to this list.

I am trying to get a better understanding of identifier as used in OAI 
protocol.

According to the standard (I'm using 
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm#UniqueIdentifier) 
, a unique identifier is defined as a URI which by definition contains 
ftp:, http:, oai: etc.

We use an ark as our persistent URI (see 
http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/ark/):
http://findaid.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/ft2s200504

My question is how to set up the description element of the Identity 
response to describe this non-oai identifier.

Any help would be terrific.

Thanks

If you are not using oai-identifiers then you must not include an
oai-identifier description block in your Identify response. The
oai-identifier description container (defined by the schema
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai-identifier.xsd) is specific 
to the oai-identifier scheme.

It's also important to distinguish between the identifier for the
RESOURCE, which would go in a dc:identifier (for Dublin core metadata)
field, and the identifier for the OAI ITEM, which would be in the OAI
record header, and would be the value for the OAI identifier argument
(for GetRecord verb, for example).

It's unusual to have a full URL (starting "http://") as the identifier
of an OAI ITEM, while it is common to have a full URL in a dc:identifier
field.

hi

a random observation ...

i just looked at the schema for oai-identifier and realised that, yes, 
it will only work for "oai" identifiers (something i didnt realise 
myself until now). two of the fields seem to be required but with fixed 
values, while the sampleIdentifier embeds additional copies of the 
repositoryIdentifier, schema and delimiter.

in future, for network bandwidth, minimalism and normalisation reasons, 
lets try to avoid this unnecessary duplication ... i know people will 
say bandwidth is cheap but that argument only works if u're living in 
some countries of the world and definitely not in south africa :)

on a different note, Naomi made a comment about URLs being unusual as 
oai identifiers. i just wanted to add that it is not inconceivable to 
create an oai identifier by prepending "oai:<repositoryId>:" to a URL to 
denote the item describing a URL-accesssible resource. if i am not 
mistaken, PhysNet did (or still does) this. it is a neat trick to expose 
a collection of web pages as oai records, thereby enabling you to 
integrate web pages with other oai collections in local service providers!

ttfn,
----hussein

The OAI 2.0 protocol supports the compression of OAI response messages.
Compression algorithms like the one used in 'gzip' are extremely good at
eliminating this sort of redundancy.

Message-ID: <E5431CF93E29F9478878F623E5B9CE98063326AC@oa3-server.oa.oclc.org>

The ERRoL service now provides an RSS view for any repository registered in
the OAI registry at UIUC (assuming a unique repository identifier is defined
there). The pattern for the RSS URL is "http://errol.oclc.org/" +
repositoryIdentifier + ".rss" (e.g.
http://errol.oclc.org/xmlregistry.oclc.org.rss). Optional arguments include
"set" and "metadataPrefix", which will restrict the RSS feed to the
corresponding OAI subsets (e.g.
http://errol.oclc.org/xmlregistry.oclc.org.rss?set=Projects:OAIViewer&metada
taPrefix=xsl. There is plenty of room for improvement and customization, so
contact me if you think this service is useful and could be improved.

BTW, the OAI Viewer service has also been expanded and improved
substantially and can be accessed from http://errol.oclc.org/. The OAI
Viewer service provides interactive browser access to OAI repositories
listed in the UIUC registry . Context sensitive RSS icons/links appears in
the OAI Viewer displays as well.

Sorry to bug the list on something like this but what exactly does the 
repositoryIdentifier represent?

Is it an organizational id (e.g. cdlib.org) or is it an identifier specific 
to the oai service (e.g. oai.cdlib.org)?

Does the id have any  special functional meaning - used in some list of 
providers etc.

Is there  a document (etc.) that describes  the semantics of these elements 
- so I won't have to bug the list?

Thanks!

Hi David,

Repository identifiers derive mainly from their use in "oai-identifiers",
which are described at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-oai-identifier.htm. Both of
your examples are suitable, but the second one is a little better since it
allows you to distinguish between multiple OAI servers that your institution
may want to host eventually. Actually, "oai.cdlib.org" isn't so good at this
though since it's too generic. Something better would be IDs like
theses.cdlib.org or eprints.cdlib.org or maps.cdlib.org and so forth.

If you're not using the oai-identifier scheme, there is no requirement for
you to create a repository identifier. They are mainly there as a clue to
where the OAI records came from. For example, if you register your
repository with the OAI Registry at UIUC
(http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/) people can take your
oai-identifiers and easily find the home repository where it came from.

One advantage to registering a repository identifier with UIUC is that it
allows you to take advantage of the ERRoL services that I'm developing
(http://errol.oclc.org/). The ERRoL service provides extended functionality
to any OAI repository registered at UIUC (that has a repository identifier
defined). Examples of these services are an OAI to RSS conversion, browser
navigation of the repository, and a variety of persistent URLs to content in
and related to records in OAI repositories. Other services are planned.
These services are only available, though, for OAI repositories that
register a repository identifier at UIUC.

Hope this helps.

Jeff
