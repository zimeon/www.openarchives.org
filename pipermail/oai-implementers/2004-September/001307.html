<PRE>BioMed Central similarly uses a stateless approach for resumption tokens,
and I too have been concerned about long term scaleability using 

(a)  the stateless approach:
Retrieving items 999,900 to 1,000,000 of an ordered set from a database
tends can be a very expensive operation, and using 10,000 such 100 item
requests in order to retrieve a full listing from an OAI-enabled database
containing  a million records is clearly vastly more expensive (in terms of
resources) than, say downloading a compressed file containing the data for
all 1 million records in one go.

(b) a stateful approach 
Caching lots of resultsets is the middle tier doesn't really seem easily
scaleable to very large sets, since cached resultsets tend to be inherently
memory-resident. A database temporary table for each new request could be
used, but would create its own resource issues.



I guess that the best that can be done is to sort items by a unique ordered
accession number/id/ (which doesn't change if an item is updated) and to use
this value as the resumption token, rather than using &quot;offset within the
ordered set&quot; as the resumption token. This should help both reliability and
performance (since appropriate relational database indexes can allow the
performance of  set=xxxx and accessionnumber&gt;yyyy this to be tuned pretty
effectively, in a way that 

set=xxxx and offset&gt;yyyyyy 

cannot be

&gt;<i> DSpace uses the 'stateless' approach - see 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dspace.org/technology/system-docs/application.html#oai">http://dspace.org/technology/system-docs/application.html#oai</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> and scroll down a bit.  The sorting is done by (internal 
</I>&gt;<i> database) ID so de-dupping shouldn't be an issue for the 
</I>&gt;<i> harvester.  However your corner case may just cause a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem, or weird side-effect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Say you're harvesting date range X-Y.  When you first issue 
</I>&gt;<i> the request, a certain set of items have a 'last modified' 
</I>&gt;<i> date within that range, so DSpace returns a load, and a 
</I>&gt;<i> resumption token.  If some items are then modified so that 
</I>&gt;<i> their 'last modified' date is outside the date range X-Y, 
</I>&gt;<i> they'll drop off that list, so suddenly item Z that was 
</I>&gt;<i> result number 101 of those items is now result number 99, and 
</I>&gt;<i> the next harvest request will miss it, since DSpace will 
</I>&gt;<i> think that Z was already served up in the first request.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DSpace would probably work OK in the scenario you've 
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned if the date range specified is X-(present) or no 
</I>&gt;<i> date range; results are sorted by ID so the order wouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> change, new items would appear at the end of the list and 
</I>&gt;<i> updated items wouldn't have 'moved'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Deleted items might be a bit yucky though...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you could to 'freeze' a result set when a harvest comes 
</I>&gt;<i> in, but that may not scale up when your repository is huge 
</I>&gt;<i> and the number of harvests is large (caching dozens of 
</I>&gt;<i> 100,000-long result sets?)
