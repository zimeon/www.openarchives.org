Like, Tom it seems I get https pretty much for free with my Perl harvester
using LWP (just had to install Net::SSL package). I was then able to
harvest from the <A HREF="https://ir.uoregon.edu:8443/dspace-oai">https://ir.uoregon.edu:8443/dspace-oai</A> site listed on
<A HREF="http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListAllAllRepos.asp.">http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListAllAllRepos.asp.</A>

However, https is not an 'accepted' transport for OAI-PMH. The
specification describes only http transport. I wonder if there any good
reason to encourage harvesters to support https in 'open' applications?

Cheers,
Simeon
