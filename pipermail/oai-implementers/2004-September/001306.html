<PRE>After reading the couple of responses, my first inclination is to;

1) Store the parameters and regenerate the query when the resumption 
token is received.

But what I think I will also add is to store the total number of 
results when the query was first run. If the current total is different 
from that number, it invalidates the token and tells the harvester. 
This is the best way I can think of to deal with this issue.....

Any other suggestions would be certainly entertained.......

</I>&gt;<i> DSpace uses the 'stateless' approach - see 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dspace.org/technology/system-docs/application.html#oai">http://dspace.org/technology/system-docs/application.html#oai</A> and 
</I>&gt;<i> scroll down a bit.  The sorting is done by (internal database) ID so 
</I>&gt;<i> de-dupping shouldn't be an issue for the harvester.  However your 
</I>&gt;<i> corner case may just cause a problem, or weird side-effect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Say you're harvesting date range X-Y.  When you first issue the 
</I>&gt;<i> request, a certain set of items have a 'last modified' date within 
</I>&gt;<i> that range, so DSpace returns a load, and a resumption token.  If some 
</I>&gt;<i> items are then modified so that their 'last modified' date is outside 
</I>&gt;<i> the date range X-Y, they'll drop off that list, so suddenly item Z 
</I>&gt;<i> that was result number 101 of those items is now result number 99, and 
</I>&gt;<i> the next harvest request will miss it, since DSpace will think that Z 
</I>&gt;<i> was already served up in the first request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DSpace would probably work OK in the scenario you've mentioned if the 
</I>&gt;<i> date range specified is X-(present) or no date range; results are 
</I>&gt;<i> sorted by ID so the order wouldn't change, new items would appear at 
</I>&gt;<i> the end of the list and updated items wouldn't have 'moved'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Deleted items might be a bit yucky though...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you could to 'freeze' a result set when a harvest comes in, but 
</I>&gt;<i> that may not scale up when your repository is huge and the number of 
</I>&gt;<i> harvests is large (caching dozens of 100,000-long result sets?)
