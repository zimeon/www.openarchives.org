Subject: [OAI-implementers] Adding support for new metadata with existing XSL convertion file...
Message-ID: <BAY10-F16HhdUEkKkD20003368c@hotmail.com>

Hi,

I got a few newbie questions in this area.

I am lookig into adding support for MARCXML in my PMH-OAI (the PHP scripts 
from Oldenburg). However I am new to XML and wonder how the best way to do 
this is ?

Could I use the existing conversion file 
http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/xslt/DC2MARC21slim.xsl to convert my 
existing data in oai_dc format into MARCXML ?

Could a harvester read a file with my original oai_dc data with a 
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" 
href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/xslt/DC2MARC21slim.xsl"?> tag in 
it in order to read it as MARCXML ? Or do I need to implement the convertion 
internally in my OAI ?

/Cheers,

Jim

Hi,

I'm building a repository where updates are sent by ftp once every week
(lets say monday). The records in this file have timestamps. Now, since
the flow of records is quantified, I need a way of reporting the upper
bound of the repository. A lastestDatestamp-tag would be nice.

Any other ideas?

regards,
  Martin

Hi Martin,

You probably cannot safely use the timestamps that come with the records
in this file. The record datestamps in the OAI record headers must be the
timestamps when the material becomes available (subject to chosen
granularity). Adding material with a datestamp before the current time
means that records can be missed in incremental harvests.

> Now, since

It is not clear why you want to expose the latest datestamp. Harvesters
will usually harvest either all content, or content from the previous
incremental harvest datestamp onward (no until date). In both cases newly
added records will be successfully harvested.

Cheers,
Simeon

That was what I was afraid of. This means that if you build chains if
OAI-servers, data will be delivered in larger and larger chunks since
you cannot use the timestamp from the originating server (or the
original metadata).

Well, if you have a latest datestamp, then you can harvest from the
previous datestamp until the latest, and if records are added with a
datestamp that is after that datestamp (but before the time you
harvested) you would still get that record next time around.

This would ofcourse add some complexity to the procedure, so it's
probably not worth it. It'll be fun for the clients though, no records
for two weeks, then about 30.000, and then nothing for two weeks ... :)

mvh,
  Martin

Hi to all,

I'm searching a service provider that can resolve an oai identifier in a 
query to an xml with the metadata of the record.

For example I have the oai identifier ' oai:eprints.rclis.org:830'.
I send to the service providere the identifier and nothing else.
The service provider:
-It undestands that the eprints server is http://eprints.rclis.org
-It knows that the eprints server Base URL is 
http://eprints.rclis.org/perl/oai2/
-It sends me that string (the query to harvest the record) : 
http://eprints.rclis.org/perl/oai2/?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:eprints.rclis.org:830&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

I try to use OAI Registry at UIUC  and ERRoLs to optain that result but it 
si not possible to have that result with them.

Does sameone know a service provider tha offers a service like this ?

Thanks for all.

DP9 provides a similar service like what you described.

http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/resolver.jsp

You may select either "html","xml", or "redirect" as output. The
"redirect" will redirect to OAI GetRecord page.

However, this service in DP9 was developed a while ago, and DP9 doesn't
have the up-to-date list of all data providers. Also, this function of DP9
will  only work for data providers which follow OAI-PMH identifiers
implementation guideline, otherwise the program cannot dynamically figure
out baseURL from identifier.

I can look at this work again if there is interest.

Hi,

In fact a link like 
http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/getrecord.jsp?identifier=oai:eprints.rclis.org:830&prefix=oai_dc&output=redirect
is exactly what i need.

Why do I need a similar service ?

I'm developing a service provider to collect the OAI-PMH Data Provider 
about Library and Information Science.
I'm studing how to add OpenURL to my service provider. I want that my 
service provider will be a "Source" in OpenUrl jargon, like ArXiv.
With the help of Simeon Warner I'm reading the code of ArXiv about OpenUrl.

ArXiv sends to the OpenUrl resolvers (like OpenResolver from Andy Powell) 
only the oai-identifier. The resolver reads the oai-identifier and it 
understands, from a specific OpenUrl field [called 'sid'], that the 
oai-identifier cames from ArXiv.
After those operations, the resolver send a query to a specif gateway of 
ArXiv and it recives an XML with all metadata in rfc1807.
Now, the resolver parses the XML, it extract the metadata, and after it 
builts the "special effects links"

Send only the oai-identifier is very easy for me, but it is not possible 
that resolvers have specific gateway for all OAI-PMH Data Provider. So it 
is better to have only one service to do this redirection

>However, this service in DP9 was developed a while ago, and DP9 doesn't

For me, now, I need only those archive:

Many are still present in DP9, can you add the missing ones ?

For me DP9 is quite useful as service provider. I can see it as "CrossRef 
for OAI-PMH Data Provider"

Thanks for all.

Zeno,

These data providers have been added to DP9 list. However I cannot connect
to http://drtc.isibang.ac.in/ (we can talk about this offline).

As discussed earlier
(http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2003-October/thread.html)
My solution will only work for data providers which follow oai-identifier
implementation guideline. For other data providers, you probably want to
talk with Thom Hickey and Jeff Young. Their solution work for all data
providers by assigning unique identifier for each repository, but you will
have to specify repo-id in requests.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI Static Repository Specfication released
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0404231140010.18053@dhcp103-124.cs.cornell.edu>

We are pleased to announce the release of the OAI Static Repository and
Static Repository Gateway Specification:
  http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm

The OAI Static Repository provides a simple approach for exposing
relatively static and small collections of metadata records through the
OAI-PMH, without the complexity of implementing an OAI-PMH server. A
Static Repository is an XML file containing metadata records and
repository information that is made accessible at a persistent HTTP URL. A
Static Repository Gateway provides intermediation for one or more Static
Repositories by responding to OAI-PMH requests using data from the Static
Repositories.

Hello,

I've created a skeletal OAI data provider which merely returns error 
responses based on the arguments supplied to the URL. Could someone 
tell me if / where there are services to test OAI compliance for the 
case above ?


Thanks,
Aravind

I guess you want to validate your data provider?  if so, check out Hussein's

Hi Zeno,

Sorry I'm late, but I'm still catching up on my email after a vacation.

http://errol.oclc.org/oai:eprints.rclis.org:830

Is this what you want?

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Resolver of OAI record Uniqe Identifier

Hi to all,

I'm searching a service provider that can resolve an oai identifier in a 
query to an xml with the metadata of the record.

For example I have the oai identifier ' oai:eprints.rclis.org:830'.
I send to the service providere the identifier and nothing else.
The service provider:
-It undestands that the eprints server is http://eprints.rclis.org
-It knows that the eprints server Base URL is 
http://eprints.rclis.org/perl/oai2/
-It sends me that string (the query to harvest the record) : 
http://eprints.rclis.org/perl/oai2/?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:eprints.rc
lis.org:830&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

I try to use OAI Registry at UIUC  and ERRoLs to optain that result but it 
si not possible to have that result with them.

Does sameone know a service provider tha offers a service like this ?

Thanks for all.

Zeno,

ERRoLs will work for any type of identifier used in a registered OAI
repository. For oai-identifiers, the pattern is:

"http://errol.oclc.org/" + <oai-identifier>

For other types of identifiers, the pattern is:

"http://errol.oclc.org/" + <repository-identifier> + "/" + <item-identifier>

These URLs (generally) result in an OAI oai_dc GetRecord response. Other
types of results can be obtained by adding various extensions and
parameters.

Zeno,

These data providers have been added to DP9 list. However I cannot connect
to http://drtc.isibang.ac.in/ (we can talk about this offline).

As discussed earlier
(http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2003-October/thread.
html)
My solution will only work for data providers which follow oai-identifier
implementation guideline. For other data providers, you probably want to
talk with Thom Hickey and Jeff Young. Their solution work for all data
providers by assigning unique identifier for each repository, but you will
have to specify repo-id in requests.
