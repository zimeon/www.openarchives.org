This question is a structural question about XML Schema in the OAI context.   We have a project to develop an XML Schema for the structured Format Description Documents (FDDs) in http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/.  One objective is to make the FDDs OAI-harvestable.

One aspect of the FDDs  (example: http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000022.shtml)  is that the text in many of the table cells needs to be richer than plain text. We have identified a small set of HTML tags that we want to be able to use in a complexType to be called notesText.   We want the schema to limit us to that small set of tags as we edit FDDs.

We have two structural options for the fdd.xsd schema.  We plan to have the fdd.xsd schema use the namespace "fdd" and require that element names be qualified with their namespace.

1.  We could put the HTML tags into a separate .xsd file (to be included in fdd.xsd) that does not require the elements to be qualified.  This way we could use the HTML tags directly within the chunks of notesText.  They would be easily recognized, have familiar semantics, and be handled trivially in XSLT transformations to HTML.

2.  For the convenience of having the specification in a single .xsd file, we could use different names (presumably in the fdd namespace).  These would be more cumbersome to read in the raw XML and need more work to convert to HTML.

What do you see as pros and cons between these options?  For example, will OAI-harvesting applications have problems with the two-schema approach (option 1).

Thanks for any feedback.   I will also be asking potential users of the harvested FDDs the equivalent question.

This interests me from both the OAI and the format description sides. I 
don't see any particular difficulty in having the HTML tags in a 
separate XSD; the additional work should be minor at most. The 
transparency of not using false tags should make up for any additional 
programming effort.

Hi Caroline,

My inclination would be your #1 below for the reasons you've already 
given.  I don't think any OAI harvester would have a problem harvesting 
records with a 'mixed' XML schema where various namespaces are imported 
or included from different schema.  In fact the OAI_DC schema itself is 
already like this, defining its own root element and then importing the 
DC elements from a different XML schema.  MODS is similar, importing 
xlink attributes from a separate schema.

Kind regards,
	Tom

I am now considering this same topic that was raised on this list a

OAI, I'm wondering if I can additionally expose an existing OAI data

For a while we experimented with an OAI feed for Index Data's Zebra
information server that could be run periodically against a set of OAI
data providers to inject updates into zebra (Sorry, Zebra is one of the
hottest Z39.50 and SRW/U Server components around) using the Z39.50
extended service for update. It all seemed to work quite well, but there
wasn't really any demand for it at the time.. if there's interest now,
I'm sure we can revive the code and rebuild it using the latest versions
of JZKit and Zebra and stick it up on sourceforge.

Hi all. If the Z39.50 resource is able to be queried as a SQL database, 
the VTLS library system vendor have produced a thing called "Vortex". 
It's written for their Virtua library system (which we don't have by the 
way). I've downloaded it and briefly looked at it, and it looks like 
you'd be able to modify it to allow OAI harvesting from a MARC database 
that's query-able via SQL queries. It uses some SQL queries (via Perl) 
to query for sets of records from the Virtua catalogue. You might find 
that you can configure it to meets your needs. It's open source, so 
there's no problem with downloading and using or modifying it.

It's available at:
http://www.vtls.com/Products/vortex.shtml

Hi Leslie

There have been several replies to your initial posting all of which have a
slightly different take on your requirements.

Just for clarification.

Are you looking to take an OAI feed and make its contents additionally
available as a Z39.50/SRW/SRU target using the OAI feed itself to populate
the Z39.50 system?

Or are you looking to modify the underlying OAI database (data source) to
support Z39.50/SRW/SRU?


Cheers

Rob

Yes, this is precisely what I am interested in doing.  I have an OAI 
data provider already that exposes oai-dc records (with MODS 
planned), and I would like to potentially use this data to 
additionally populate a Z39.50 system or gateway.

It seemed worth researching, but it's not looking like there are any 
tools to do this, at least not anything near production-ready.


>Or are you looking to modify the underlying OAI database (data source) to
>support Z39.50/SRW/SRU?

No, I definitely do not want to do that.  My data source is XML, 
programmatically generated from many different originating source 
metadata formats.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Re: [OAI-PMH] an error in a regular expression
 describing an OAI Identifier

Hi All,

Agnieszka Lewandowska has pointed out an error in the patterns matching 
domain names in the oai-identifier.xsd schema (message excerpt below, the 
current schema doesn't permit single letter subdomain names). Such names 
should be permitted (see: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt) so I 
propose the following updates:

in definition of repositoryIdentifierType:

<       <pattern value="[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*(\.[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]+)+"/>
---
>       <pattern value="[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*(\.[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*)+"/>

and in definition of sampleIdentifierType:

<       <pattern value="oai:[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*(\.[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]+)+:[a-zA-Z0-9\-_\.!~\*&apos;\(\);/\?:@&amp;=\+$,%]+"/>
--
>       <pattern value="oai:[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*(\.[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-]*)+:[a-zA-Z0-9\-_\.!~\*&apos;\(\);/\?:@&amp;=\+$,%]+"/>

I have put the updated schema online at
   http://openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai-identifier.xsd.2007-05-22
and there is a test instance at
   http://openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai-identifier-test4.xml

This change should not invalidate any currently valid instance. Unless 
someone points out an error I will update the live schema version in a 
week or two.

Cheers,
Simeon



(For the really pedantic, the schema pattern is too broad in that it 
permits a subdomain name ending in a hyphen (e.g "a-.com") which is not 
valid according to RFC1035. Correcting this would make the patterns more 
complicated and and I think it probably isn't worth it to change to 
something like
<pattern value="[a-zA-Z]([a-zA-Z0-9]|[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+[a-zA-Z0-9])?(\.[a-zA-Z]([a-zA-Z0-9]|[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+[a-zA-Z0-9])?)+"> 
However, we could do this is people see value in it.)

Hello.
I tried to register the following repository: 
http://www.tdr.cesca.es/TDR_UOV/NDLTD-OAI/oai.pl
in the openarchives. It passes all of tests except one post test:

"Request: POST http://www.tdr.cesca.es/TDR_UOV/NDLTD-OAI/oai.pl 
(Content: verb=GetRecord, identifier=oai:UOV.es:TDR-0328107-140900, 
metadataPrefix=oai_dc)" (it's the second POST test).

Months ago, we registered others data providers:

http://www.tdr.cesca.es/TDR_UDC/NDLTD-OAI/oai.pl
http://www.tdx.cesca.es/TDX_UAB/NDLTD-OAI/oai.pl

http://www.tdx.cesca.es/TDX_UPC/NDLTD-OAI/oai.pl

We've been using Ming Luo and Hussein Suleman's ETD-db OAI Extensions 
(v.2-10) and till now, all of them has been registered successfully. It 
seems that the repository does not respond the HTTP POST requests, but 
the HTTP GET requests works fine. What's happening now with the tests? 
Why worked fine months ago with other repositories and now it's not 
working? Any ideas to solve this problem?

Thanks in advance
