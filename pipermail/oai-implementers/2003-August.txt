Subject: [OAI-implementers] Scientific journal metadata
Message-ID: <5.0.2.1.2.20030801155148.01e731b8@mail2.allenpress.com>

Greetings,

I'm implementing an OAI repository of scientific journals, but I'm not sure 
what to do with the volume, issue and page metadata for the unqualified dc 
format. I've read a few debates over this but I've not seen where it's been 
solved.

I had thought about adding a bibiographic record in dc.source, as in...
<dc:source>Journal of Some Research 120(3), 133-165</dc:source>

But I can see arguments against this.

It seems logical to acknowledge that this metadata can not exist in 
unqualified dc format, and encourage harvesters to use our more-specific 
metadata format. This would mean unqualified dc from our repository would 
be fairly useless.

Is this the accepted way to expose scientific journals through OAI?

Thanks,
Jeremy Keeler

For arXiv, I put bibliographic refereces in dc:identifier elements, e.g.

<dc:identifier>Prog.Theor.Phys. 101 (1999) 1155-1164</dc:identifier>

in 

http://arXiv.org/oai2?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/9901001

I do not think dc:source is correct since that is for a "A Reference to a
resource from which the present resource is derived". I assume in your
context, as in arXiv's, the bibliographic reference is a reference to the
resource that the record describes.

Cheers,
Simeon.

and just for contrast, I put bibliographic information in dc:type and use
dc:identifier strictly for URIs.

see, for example:

http://ntrs.nasa.gov/?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai:ltrs.larc.nasa.gov:NASA-aiaa-97-1321

my rationale...  reading the descriptions at:

http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dces/

I can see where bibliographic info could go in dc:identifier.  But I hate
to have both free text & URIs in dc:identifier, and dc:type looks pretty
good. And you make an argument that the bibliographic info tells you a
good bit about resource type.

regards,

Michael

Hi Jeremy:

Not sure how relevant this might be to you but for some prototype work we
have recently been doing to syndicate tables of contents with RSS, some of
us from Elsevier and Nature Publishing Group have used the PRISM (Publisher
Requirements for Industry Standard Metadata) term set which seems to offer a
suitable level of granularity in the enumeration metadata fields. See some
of the examples, we have posted:

These examples are using RSS, but should give a flavour of what can be
captured using PRISM. See especially the Nature example.

The full specification for the PRISM spec can be found on the website:

Dear All,

People from the digital library and publishing communities within 
the Dublin Core community have long been aware that there is no 
obvious place to include the bibliographic information for a resource 
that is a journal article within its own metadata in simple Dublin 
Core. This is really because simple Dublin Core is just that - a core 
set of metadata for general resource description. As soon as you 
want to describe something more domain-specific you need either 
qualifed Dublin Core or even more application-specific metadata.

The discussion about which element to use for bibliographic 
metadata has gone on for many years within the DC community. 
The final recommendation is to use 'identifier' because this 
information identifies the resource. I realise this may look 
inconsistent with URIs within Identifier - but this is simple DC we're 
talking about where the value of a property is just text (you need 
qualified DC to say that it is a URI).

I'm afraid I cannot see that bibliographic information fits into the 
semantics of Type (the nature or genre of the content of the 
resource) though I suppose you could loosely be saying this is a 
journal article.

The problem with everyone making their own choice of element to 
include the bibliographic information is a loss of interoperability. It 
means you have to understand the semantics of a particular 
repository's metadata to process it.

The small amount of development I've done with OAI-PMH has 
made me question the value of passing simple DC records. It 
seems that the richness of the information often gets dumbed-down 
to probably be of little use. Simple DC is really just for basic 
interoperability not for passing richer descriptions.

If you were to use qualified DC, there is now a property 
dcterms:bibliographicCitation to hold this information. It is a 
refinement of Identifier. At present there is no recommendation for 
the content of this element beyond simple text. But we are hoping 
to define a Dublin Core Structured Value to hold this information in 
a more machine-processable way. This has actually been more-or-
less defined for some time and is probably already in use. (See 
http://www.dublincore.org/groups/citation/ for more information).

Some of the proposals for the OpenURL Framework may also 
provide a solution, and the DCMI Citation working group will be 
investigating that.

Best wishes,
	Ann

(apologies for top-posting!)

I agree with Ann's approach to DC encoding of journal references. I would
simply add that DC applications have to deal with strings, hence can tell
the difference between a URI (http: etc.) and an unstructured string (e.g. a
citation). Including a mix of structured and unstructured identifiers is not
a problem.

Current (?) DCMI terms aka qualified DC:
http://dublincore.org/documents/2003/03/04/dcmi-terms/

Is there an updated XML schema
(http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/xmlschema/) that reflects the current
DCMI terms set?

All the best,
Tim.

Message-ID: <B1D41F4ABBC45949BC3539F5831D4425301E6C@EXCHVS2.cs.cornell.edu>

Dublin Core has been the mandated metadata format in OAI-PMH since the
initial release of the protocol. The purpose of this requirement was to
promote interoperability among data providers. It was the subject of
considerable discussion in the formulation of both the 1.0 and 2.0
specifications and we think that it is time to reexamine this
requirement in light of two factors:

1. There is increasing interest in using the protocol for applications
other than sharing metadata to promote resource discovery [1][2]. Dublin
Core is targeted mainly as metadata for resource discovery and is,
therefore, inappropriate for these other applications.  It might make
sense to loosen the Dublin Core requirement to a recommendation, and
thus reduce any barrier to these broader applications.    

2.  The linkage between Dublin Core and OAI-PMH has been over-emphasized
at the expense of the utility of OAI-PMH for dissemination of richer,
and perhaps more useful, structured data.  In some cases data providers
with richer metadata (e.g., MARC, IEEE LOM) have been forced by the
requirement to dumb-down rich metadata to Dublin Core and have then
failed to provide the original metadata.  As a result, the community
looses the benefits of rich data and is left with the reduced semantics
of Dublin Core.

We need to choose between the competing goals of protocol stability and

Thank you all for replying. I will do as Simeon and Ann suggest- create a 
second dc:identifier element for the bibliographic information. I imagine 
we'll end up supporting several formats like PRISM and dc with citation 
qualifiers. It can't see a reason to create our own format since there are 
already many flexible options available.

Thanks again!

I'm not going to provide feedback on the proposal :-) but will instead 
self-promote ;-) and re-provide a link to my master's thesis results, which 
are relevant to this discussion. For my thesis, I analyzed usage of the 
unqualified DC Element Set in OAI-PMH DPs.  I sent the results out and a 
link to the full thesis to the OAI-General mailing list last December 2002.

A 3-page summary of the thesis is available via: 
http://csdl.computer.org/comp/proceedings/jcdl/2003/1939/00/19390315abs.htm. 
Or, you can read the full results starting from page 25 at: 
http://www.foar.net/research/mp/Jewel_Ward-MPaper-November2002.pdf.

Also available on my web site is the raw data I used, as well as multiple 
charts, graphs, etc.  Go to: http://www.foar.net/research/index.html and 
click on the link "Master's Paper", then the link "All Figures and Tables".

Partial Abstract:
...

This research describes an empirical study of how the Dublin Core Metadata 
Element Set (DCMES) is used by 100 Data Providers (DPs) registered with the 
Open Archives Initiative (OAI).  The research was conducted to determine 
whether or not the DCMES is used to its full capabilities.

Eighty-two of 100 DPs have metadata records available for analysis.  DCMES 
usage varies by type of DP.  The average number of Dublin Core elements per 
record is eight, with an average of 91,785 Dublin Core elements used per 
DP.  Five of the 15 elements of the DCMES are used 71% of the time.  The 
results show the DCMES is not used to its fullest extent within DPs 
registered with OAI.

Jewel

No comments about 3, but I agree with 1 and 2.

If two parties want to talk to each other, they need to agree on how
they are going to talk. Supporting oai_dc is a good thing to do, but
there is nothing in the protocol that will break if DC is not supported.
If two parties want to use OAI to exchange data in a closed environment,
they will probably not bother supporting oai_dc anyway.

So I can see no harm in degrading oai_dc from a requirement to a
recommendation (with prose explaining why it is a good thing to support).

I full agree with this direction!
We, at the National Library of Portugal (BN), are an example of that
case! We have been using OAI-PMH for several purposes, and we'd like to
expand that usage, as for example for the transport of UNIMARC Authority
records (which have no straight mapping to the DCMES).

On the other side we'll need to be carefull to avoid mess. If everyone
starts publishing metadata using his/her own schema (even when they
claim to be using MARC21 or UNIMARC, sometimes people make very strange
data...), the risk of loosing interoperability can be high. But this is
just going back to the real world, I guess :)

To deal with that we could do a few thinks, IMHO:

- We could discuss the design and development of a new kind of service,
which we could call of "metadata schema verifier (MSV)". These could be
services that data providers could use before the release of their
server, to check their metadata (the structure, not the smantics, off
course). A MSV for UNIMARC, for example, would act as a service
provider. It'd get the data from a data provider, check its structure
against the official standard, and produce a report to be delivered to
the data provider.
The OAI community could define and design these services, and invite
each relevant agency/entity in charge of a schema to support an
implementation for its case.

- Another interesting service to the community could be the publishing,
in the OAI reference site, of XSLT transformations of the non-DC
metadata schemas to DC, when possible and when it'd make sense. The
perfect scenario would be the possibility to "plug" those
transformations in the OAI clients, and use them when desired. This
would make it possible for a data provider to publish the metadata in
its own schema X, send it like that to a service provider, but on this
side it could be immediatly transformed to DC by the client, if desired,
just like if it were published in DC. I'm not sure if this will really
work 100%, but at least for the more common standards it might work
well...

- Finally, the previous two scenarios could be related with a
registration service for the no-DC schemas. This could consist in the
registration of the MSV service and the "XSLT for DC" in the OAI site,
which would result also in the reservation of the respective
metadataPrefix.

Does this make sense? Not too complicate?

We can do this for UNIMARC at BN...

Assunto: [OAI-implementers] Reconsidering mandatory DC in OAI-PMH


Dublin Core has been the mandated metadata format in OAI-PMH since the
initial release of the protocol. The purpose of this requirement was to
promote interoperability among data providers. It was the subject of
considerable discussion in the formulation of both the 1.0 and 2.0
specifications and we think that it is time to reexamine this
requirement in light of two factors:

1. There is increasing interest in using the protocol for applications
other than sharing metadata to promote resource discovery [1][2]. Dublin
Core is targeted mainly as metadata for resource discovery and is,
therefore, inappropriate for these other applications.  It might make
sense to loosen the Dublin Core requirement to a recommendation, and
thus reduce any barrier to these broader applications.    

2.  The linkage between Dublin Core and OAI-PMH has been over-emphasized
at the expense of the utility of OAI-PMH for dissemination of richer,
and perhaps more useful, structured data.  In some cases data providers
with richer metadata (e.g., MARC, IEEE LOM) have been forced by the
requirement to dumb-down rich metadata to Dublin Core and have then
failed to provide the original metadata.  As a result, the community
looses the benefits of rich data and is left with the reduced semantics
of Dublin Core.

We need to choose between the competing goals of protocol stability and
generalization.  Although removing the Dublin Core requirement would not
negatively impact existing or future data providers, it may impact
service providers whose applications depend on the existence of a
uniform metadata format.

We would like to open this subject for community discussion. While the
technical aspects of this change are minimal it does have considerable
political impact. Please give your feedback on the following proposal:

1. Change the Dublin Core requirement to a recommendation.
2. Leave oai_dc as a reserved metadataPrefix

I fully support all three modifications. As far as I remember the Specs, they 
generally stick to how OAI-PMH can be used for digital libraries and cover the 
respecitve metadata formats. Maybe they could be modified or extended to 
discuss a more generic approach and use of OAI-PMH. 
 
To examplify a possible generic use of OAI-PMH: We use OAI-PMH in the CONESYS 
[1] OSS project, where we define arbitrary metadata repositories in XSD. The 
XML format defined in a XSD is then harvested between the same repositories of 
different CONESYS installations. The XSD-defined metadata format serves as the 
"native" format which can be transformed to other formats like DC to provide a 
standardized metadata interface to other content collectors. In general, 
CONESYS aims to be a middleware and administration software to create content 
networks, by virtually harvesting and distributing any metadata in the context 
of CMS.

hi

i should add my strong support for this proposal from the perspective of 
building componentised digital libraries.

my experiences in recent years have shown that the OAI-PMH can be very 
useful for transferring data among completely separable internal 
components of a digital library. while experimenting with the 
OAI-PMHv1.1, i had to work around a few issues, almost all of which were 
subsequently resolved in OAI-PMHv2.0 (granularity, list sizes, etc.). 
currently, the biggest remaining stumbling block is the requirement for 
DC versions of records, which makes no sense in the closed environment 
of a local but componentised dl.

i believe that removing this as a requirement will enable internal (in 
addition to external) data transfers to use OAI-PMH, and will encourage 
the building of finer-grained service provision components that can be 
interconnected instead of service providers being themselves monolithic 
software systems.

also, let me add that i think Jose Borbinha's ideas are great. we really 
should have some kind of registry of formats/transformations and i am 
sure these ideas have been mentioned before. there is only the issue of 
who will do it :)

philosophically, if this is done well, it could lead us closer to a "one 
item, one format" scenario and that has positive ramifications for 
mirroring, data consistency and standardisation of mappings. on the 
whole, changing the status of dc to a recommendation is going to make 
the PMH more viable for community-based systems rather than global OAI 
search engines like the ones we have seen thus far. personally, i think 
this is the right direction in which to aim the PMH.

lastly, before you release any new versions, do note that SOAPification 
is coming sooner or later and you need to put more thought into 
separating the essence of the protocol from the binding so we dont end 
up with protocol version soup (where soup = v2.0, v2.1, v2.0/SOAP, 
v2.1/SOAP).

ttfn,

I do strongly agree with this statement. Many times, I had to go back at
the basics and try to convince people tha OAI-PMH could transport other
XML data structures then DC.

This strong association has been of great importance in the early and
rapid adoption of OAI, because it (may) remove the burden of agreeing on
data structure for exchange. But I think that since this first step in
the adoption of OAI is now done, it would not cause too much harm to
remove this constraint.

This is the main drawback of it. I personnaly believe that in a real
distributed, multilingual, multivocabulary environment (very realistic
today), the benefits of having a common model as limited as Dublin Core
are not that important.

Agreed.

Yes, it should.

I'm surprised that all contributors to this discussion have favoured
removing the obligation for implementers of the OAI-PMH protocol to support
a baseline Dublin Core metadata format.

BioMed Central makes available not just Dublin Core, but also its own richer
XML formats, including the fulltext XML of our research articles. So I can
certainly see that there is an argument that the OAI community needs to
encourage and foster the use of OAI in ways that go beyond the basic
provision of DC metadata. 

But it still seems to be that having a baseline metadata standard that *all*
OAI providers must implement is an *extremely* useful aspect of the
protocol. 

e.g. It is currently possible to build tools which will browse an arbitrary
repository, and list the titles of the new items which were added to the
repository that day. If you remove the support for Dublin Core metadata,
then even such a simple task would become impossible (right ?).

Does it really follow that removing the requirement for Dublin Core support
would increase the support for other, richer formats? Surely the two things
are independent,

It is, but only where useful :) Think of OAI-PMH in the Weblogging world, to 
do some sophisticated RSS harvesting. DC is not used there, instead they 
disucss about RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, RDF-based RSS, Echo, etc. to achieve metadata 
interoperability. 
 
OAI-PMH is very powerful as a generic protocol for metadata harvesting, it 
should not IMHO concentrate on metadata interoperability, instead on 
interoperability on the protocol level. Finding standards for metadata 
exchange on the metadata level should not be a concern of OAI-PMH as metadata 
is bound to the semantic domain where OAI-PMH is being used.

Message-ID: <F20A55C48B0DD611A50500508BB9FC0C07AE4511@severin.cursci.co.uk>

The Dublin Core spec page says:
http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/

'The Dublin Core metadata element set is a standard for cross-domain
information resource description. Here an information resource is defined to
be "anything that has identity". '

i.e. the point about Dublin Core is that it is not tied to a specific
semantic domain.
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/resources/dc/datamodel/WD-dc-rdf/

Re: RSS - RSS seems to be a bit of morass of competing approaches right now,
but my understanding is that Dublin Core is fairly central to most proposals
for enriching the semantics of RSS.
e.g. http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/dc/

I would argue that enforcing a baseline set of cross-domain metadata
semantics is *as* important an aspect of the OAI-PMH project as is the
protocol itself. 
(Although certainly, the two could be thought of as logically distinct
sub-projects]

As an aggregator of metadata for theses and dissertations, I would hate to
loose the requirement of providing DC.  It seems as though the provider of
metadata is in the best position to do the mapping from their format into
DC, rather than having everyone who harvests have to go through the
exercise.

Yes, there are times when it does not make a lot of sense, and we are
bringing up a number of repositories that are not standard bibliographic
metadata, but even there, it does provide a minimal level of functionality
that is useful in examining OAI repositories.  The added overhead involved
is minimal compared to the benefit we receive.

Hi

I agree with Matthew here. One of the great strengths of OAI is its
mandatory support for the Dublin Core metadata format. Losing mandatory
support for that would be a mistake and would likely balkanize OAI in
various competing subformats (much like what is going on with RSS/RDF).

My suggestion would be that publicly accessible OAI servers should be
required to support the Dublin Core metadata format. If you are using OAI
internally then, obviously, you should be able to decide what formats you
want to support.

I think people are being too hasty in their dismissal of DC.

I would argue that we can maintain the DC "requirement" even for formats
that don't have a straight mapping to Dublin Core by having it describe the
primary metadata record rather than the resource itself. 

Here is an example of a subject thesaurus where the primary metadata formats
(MARCXML and Z39.19) don't map directly to Dublin Core. Note that the DC
record describes the Z39.19 record rather than the term itself.

Z39.19 record:
http://alcme.oclc.org/gsafd/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=z39_19&
identifier=Adventure+fiction

oai_dc record:
http://alcme.oclc.org/gsafd/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&
identifier=Adventure+fiction

Here is an example from the OpenURL registry which contains XML Schemas
(among other things) which also don't map directly to Dublin Core. Here, the
DC record describes the XSD record.

XSD record:
http://alcme.oclc.org/openurl/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&metadataPref
ix=xsd&identifier=ori:fmt:xml:xsd:book

oai_dc record:
http://alcme.oclc.org/openurl/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&metadataPref
ix=oai_dc&identifier=ori:fmt:xml:xsd:book

I cannot talk for the OAI project, all I say is that from my perpective, the 
two *are* logically distinct projects from a technical point of view: There's 
an OIA-PMH and OAI-DC project. OAI-PMH could recommend using DC, but I would 
not make it a requirement of OAI-PMH. This would be like requiring HTML for 
HTTP. 
 
After all, I am not a member of the community of digital libraries, instead I 
try to use OAI-PMH in a rather unorthodoxical way as I understand now :) My 
comments intend to foster a more generic and widespread use of OAI-PMH, that's 
why I'd like to see it decoupled from the DC requirement.

I fully endorse Thom's view.  I always view OAI-PMH consisting of two
distinct components: the transport protocol and the baseline metadata
standard; and I strongly believe both are necessary in promoting
interoperability and ease of sharing metadata.

I agree with Thom Hickey, Matt Cockerill, and François Schiettecatte
that it's good to continue to require Dublin Core, at least for
repositories that wish to be harvested by general service providers.  If
a data provider gives me DC, I know what to do with that and can provide
an appropriate minimal level of service for it.  If it doesn't, then I
need to figure out the semantics of whatever format it is giving me, and
how that maps into the qualified DC that my own digital library uses
internally.

On the other hand, (a) if you aren't opening up your data provider to
the world at large, then surely the rest of us don't care what meta-data
formats you're using;

and (b) we should *strongly encourage* sites to support *more* than just
DC.  Various communities, such as the Open Language Archives Community
(http://www.language-archives.org), have already started developing
their own schemata.  Perhaps the OAI could advertise this kind of thing
more prominently, as an example of "recommended practice" or "best
practice" for a data provider.

Whether we keep Dublin Core as a requirement or downgrade it to a
recommendation, however, we should certainly keep "oai_dc" as a reserved
word.

Here is an example from the OpenURL registry which contains XML Schemas
(among other things) which also don't map directly to Dublin Core. Here, the
DC record describes the XSD record.

I don't have any problem with Jose's suggestions, but:

1.  Jose, do you know that the current OAI-PMH allows any number of XML
schema validating formats, *in addition* to oai_dc?  From your message,
I wasn't sure, and we've encountered many, many, MANY folks who think
that OAI-PMH only allows oai_dc.   While a crosswalk repository may be
useful, it sounded like you were hoping to use crosswalks to
interoperate, rather than using an additional, richer metadata format.

2.  Validating OAI-PMH served metadata to its format, structurally, is
exactly equivalent to XML schema validation of OAI-PMH responses.
OAI-PMH requires an XML schema for each format served.  The XML schema
is the way that computer recognizable structural information about the
metadata is stored.


As for my stance on the oai_dc requirement -- I'm wondering about the
impact on my current employment, the National Science Digital Library.
If NSDL sites have trouble providing oai_dc, and that requirement is
removed, then what?  Can the documents be written in a way that
encourages folks to use oai_dc, particularly if they don't have another
format in mind, or if they're somewhat baffled by OAI-PMH?  Many of our
sites fall into those categories, and losing the basic metadata
interoperability provided by oai_dc could have negative ramifications on
the NSDL.  On the other hand, perhaps the NSDL could provide more
documentation for its contributors.

Lastly, I do believe that the OAI protocol itself could well be "format
neutral", and that would free it up to be used in other ways --
primarly, to exchange any schema validating XML that can be sensibly
broken up into "records."

Are there arguments for or against defining repository types each with 
their own rules for minimal compliance? Metadata requirements would be out 
of the core oai-pmh, but would be defined for communities. So through OAI I 
can say I'm a "stm repository" and harvesters would know if I support a 
certain level of functionality. This would take more thought up front as 
communities form, but only the communities who had the need for defined 
base operability would have to carry that burden. And these communities 
could still be contributing to the whole and not off in their own worlds.

Below are some experiments I did last October with 92 repositories.

In total, 21 different metadata formats are used in 92 repositories.
 The majority of them (53) use unqualified DC only, 28 repositories use
two metadata formats, four repositories use three metadata formats, and
seven use four metadata formats. The OLAC, RFC1807, OAI_ETDMS and OAI_MARC
are used more than once. The other 16 kinds of metadata format are local
formats; it is very difficult to implement service over these
metadata without individually studying each format.

I think it's pre-mature to dismiss OAI-DC before we establish a way to
encourage metadata interoperability, such as the service proposed by Jose
Borbinha.

Hello all,

I'll cast my vote in support of the Dublin Core proponents.

 From my experience implementing several different OAI-based services, I 
think that at least 50% of the OAI's current success can be attributed to 
the common Dublin Core metadata format as opposed to the transport aspects 
of protocol.  In fact, in many of my projects we have been happy to 
incorporate metadata outside the bounds of OAI as long as it conformed to 
DC, or could be easily transformed.

I do agree that we should educate implementors to encourage them to also 
support additional richer metadata formats if it makes sense for their 
domain.  However, I think it would be a shame to completely loose the DC 
least common denominator, as ugly and poorly suited as it might be for some 
metadata domains.

One person's chunk of coal (an ugly, ill-fitted mapping of some other much 
richer metadata into DC) is another person diamond (Wow, a resolvable URL 
<dc:identifier> and a blob of text in a <dc:description>.  I can't wait to 
run my full-text analyzer and indexer on it! :-))

Kind regards,
	Tom

I agree with Tom. The breadth of records in OAIster is due in large 
part to the use of the DC format by data repositories. While it may not 
be too difficult to create new XSLT stylesheets to parse non-DC 
formats, it does take time and effort (essentially money), which is in 
short supply. I recognize the need for different uses of OAI-PMH, 
however, I think we need to continue to support its use for large-scale 
service providers. I would vote for less stringent measures regarding 
the DC format.

I'm confused... I far as I understood from Carl's initial challenge, the
idea is not "forget DC", but "lets open OAI to other formats". And it
was because I understood it this way that I said "yes".

Yes, I know that I can use OAI-PMH to transport records in ANY metadata
schema. In fact that is what we been FORCED to to, EVEN WHEN THAT SCHEMA
AS NOTHING TO DO WITH DCMES (and that is when I feel stupid, because I'm
paying an overhead for nothing...).

Resuming, what I really would like to have would be a simple protocol to
transport metadata, ANY metadata, including DC! Than I'd supposed to be
disciplined enough to understand that if what I want to do is publish my
resource descriptive metadata for a wide audience, than I should use
DCMES.
This should not be a problem for NSDL, NDLTD, and all of those nice
projects over there!

But it would make it easier, for example, for this nice project, where
what we want is to transport Authors descriptions:
http://www.crxnet.com/leaf/ (this has nothing to do with DCMES! I can
follow Jeff's recommendation and use DC to describe the
UNIMARC-Authorities, MARC21-Authorities, and the other few more formats
that we are using in this project, but all of that is useless for us,
and is cheating the model...).

YES, it is really all of this what it is all about! IMHO!

What we need is a modular, simple and clear model - which is what OAI
and DCMI tried always to promote (and that's why it is a bit strange to
figure out now how the combination of both has been creating an
harnessed world, where people have to use "dirty tricks to go around",
when what we all want is simplicity...).

hi

i should add my strong support for this proposal from the perspective of

building componentised digital libraries.

my experiences in recent years have shown that the OAI-PMH can be very 
useful for transferring data among completely separable internal 
components of a digital library. while experimenting with the 
OAI-PMHv1.1, i had to work around a few issues, almost all of which were

subsequently resolved in OAI-PMHv2.0 (granularity, list sizes, etc.). 
currently, the biggest remaining stumbling block is the requirement for 
DC versions of records, which makes no sense in the closed environment 
of a local but componentised dl.

i believe that removing this as a requirement will enable internal (in 
addition to external) data transfers to use OAI-PMH, and will encourage 
the building of finer-grained service provision components that can be 
interconnected instead of service providers being themselves monolithic 
software systems.

also, let me add that i think Jose Borbinha's ideas are great. we really

should have some kind of registry of formats/transformations and i am 
sure these ideas have been mentioned before. there is only the issue of 
who will do it :)

philosophically, if this is done well, it could lead us closer to a "one

item, one format" scenario and that has positive ramifications for 
mirroring, data consistency and standardisation of mappings. on the 
whole, changing the status of dc to a recommendation is going to make 
the PMH more viable for community-based systems rather than global OAI 
search engines like the ones we have seen thus far. personally, i think 
this is the right direction in which to aim the PMH.

lastly, before you release any new versions, do note that SOAPification 
is coming sooner or later and you need to put more thought into 
separating the essence of the protocol from the binding so we dont end 
up with protocol version soup (where soup = v2.0, v2.1, v2.0/SOAP, 
v2.1/SOAP).

It is definitely not valid.  It looks they are trying to use Qualifed DC 
which is not allowed by the simple oai_dc XML Schema. There are XML Schema 
for Qualified Dublin Core that use the xsi:type attribute to specific 
Qualifed DC encoding schemes.  See 
http://www.dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qdc/2003/04/02/notes/ for details. 
If the provider wanted to provide Qualifed DC with the xsi:type attributes 
they could use one of the container schema provided from the above URL.

This is the crux of the issue. Does a harvesting service need to talk to
a metadata provider before beginning to harvest that provider's
metadata?

Currently with OAI-PMH the answer is no, and many of us (both providers
and harvesters) are glad of that since it simplifies our lives.
Currently, once a harvesting service learns of a new provider from the
OAI registration list, from the Repository Explorer list, or by other
means, that harvesting service can start harvesting the provider knowing
nothing more than oai_dc and the provider's baseURL. Certainly the
harvesting service administrator can contact the provider administrator
directly, but he or she doesn't have to. For their part, OAI providers
don't have to be bothered by everybody who wants to harvest their
metadata. (I have comments from metadata providers who say this is a
very good thing. They don't want to have to talk to everyone who might
want to harvest their metadata. That's an aspect of OAI-PMH they like,
and one reason they're willing to tolerate requirement for oai_dc.)

So, while the requirement for oai_dc is not of interest in a closed
environment (or other settings) where negotiations about exchange
metadata schema are expected to take place, having a reliable lowest
common denominator is of critical importance if you're trying to
establish and maintain a large network of open, widely accessible,
widely distributed metadata providers, such as many of us using OAI-PMH
are trying to develop. There is great value for many of us in preserving
a strongly preferred lowest common denominator for OAI-PMH, and I'm
afraid, if Z39.50 is anything to go by, a simple recommendation in the
protocol or in the Implementation Guidelines won't be sufficient
encouragement for some providers who really should be using oai_dc as
one of their formats.

But, perhaps at this stage in the evolution of OAI-PMH there are other
ways short of the current strict requirement for oai_dc as embedded in
current version of the Protocol. We should pursue this possibility
before making a definitive decision.

For instance, an open, widely accessible network of metadata providers
also requires a good registration/provider discovery service. Currently
registration of (i.e., a means to discover) OAI providers needs more
work, as we're all well aware. A single, flat centralized list isn't
going to scale well. It's not clear what's going to happen here,
long-term, but the question is will some mechanism be maintained that
will continue to vet provider services before registering them, and in
particular vet their use of oai_dc? If yes, then perhaps the requirement
to use oai_dc as such can be dropped in the Protocol itself with the
replacement recommendation elaborated to explain that oai_dc is required
if you want to register your OAI-PMH service with the formal OAI
provider registration service. This would be a carrot for providers that
really want to be visible and widely used, the ones for which oai_dc
probably does make sense. Other providers operating in closed
environments could ignore oai_dc since they would have no interest in
public registration of their services. Those few providers that want
visibility but don't want oai_dc would have to develop alternative means
of making their services known, but arguably if they're dealing with
metadata that doesn't lend itself to oai_dc, they wouldn't want to be in
a registry full of mostly oai_dc providers anyway.

Of course this alternative approach to strongly encouraging the use of
oai_dc hinges on maintaining a registration system of some kind that
requires provider services to pass certain functional tests, including
the ones for oai_dc. If instead we're going to a less formal way of
discovering OAI providers (e.g., a friends mechanism), then there would
be no carrot to encourage use of oai_dc in cases where it was most
appropriate and anarchy would prevail as has been noted by several
others in earlier responses.

So I guess I'd like to see further consideration of a relaxation of
oai_dc requirement discussed in the context of the future of OAI
provider discovery services. Will there be a way to help providers using
oai_dc get enhanced visibility for doing so?

Sounds good! It is simple, practical, and can fit well in the model!!!

Tim's analysis is correct!
I just would like to add a new element for his final conclusions, which
is the fact that even for metadata providers that create and use
internally rich metadata, the ability to publish it in DC stills
attractive, since it is a way to keep the full contents for themselves
on the same time that they make it possible to discover their resources.
I mean, if I have a complex MARC21 or UNIMARC catalogue, it doesn't mean
that I'll make the records available in those schemas just because
OAI-PMH makes it possible, since I might be giving away too much. I
might still prefer to publish the metadata in simple DC...
Thus, I don't think this possible move of the OAI-PMH to a more generic
model will be a threat to the popularity of DC!

Greetings All,

Our systems are using OAI for data exchange with various other organisations, we
are only providing access to the OAI interface via SSL and limited lists
dependant on the agreements we have with our affiliates.

We are providing our metadata in several formats, including:
 - oai_dc
 - agls  (Australian government locator service)
 - Qualified dc over rdf
 - vems 1.16 (Victorian education metadata standard v1.16)
 - vemm 2.0 (Victorian education metadata mapping v2.0)

And are happy to provide the information in any other format required, we juat
throw another xslt stylesheet at our data.

My belief is that the inclusion of oai_dc as a requirement of the protocol is
one of it's great strengths, it means that anyone who is posting the protocol to
the general public is also providing a simple and common way of extracting basic
information.  

By all means also include other formats, even your own proprietary ones to
provide full details of your content, but do also provide the oai_dc, even if
all it contains is the basic title and identifier fields for your record.

If OAI is being used as a seed protocol for internal data transfer or a
proprietory EDI system then it doesn't really matter what modifications you make
to the base protocol - as you are not expecting unknown others to have to use
the data - but if it is being exposed to the public then you have to match the
protocol exactly - and that should include the oai_dc basic requirement.

This an interesting possible line - that is, have two standards:

(1) OAI-PMH - the protocol for delivering XML records

(2) OAI-DC - repository conformance requirements

People putting repositories up for general usage must conform to
OAI-DC if they want to claim that.

One repository could also conform to several such standards at the
same time. Eg: OAI-DC and OAI-MARCXML.

This would leave DC as a 'requirement for conformance' in a standard,
(just a different standard than OAI-PMH). Making it a recommendation
only does weaken the position of DC I must admit.

I think there is a slightly different crux. In the world of public
repositories, I think oai_dc is a wonderful thing to mandate. I think
the issue is people want to use the protocol in other environments.
In these other environments people want to say 'OAI-PMH conformant'.

Hence I can see the logic in breaking the current spec into two specs
as someone suggested.

(1) OAI-PMH - the protocol

(2) OAI-DC (or whatever the name is) - the conformance standard for
    public repositories. This is OAI-PMH plus oai_dc.

OAIster and all other such harvesting sites only deal with OAI-DC
conformant sites. People putting sites up as public repositories for
general harvesting must conform to OAI-DC, or else they are not a true
public repository.

These discussions have convinced me that having DC support as a standard
people can be validated against is a mandatory thing. I have not been
convinced that the protocol and oai_dc need to be in the one spec.

  If there is no useful way to map, the result is junk information
  that polutes user services.

  You maybe, but for me as a data provider, the DC record that 
  I provide are so primitive that any user service based on
  them does a disservice to my work.

  Makes the requirments of the protocol dependent on usage scenarios.
  This does not stike me as good design.

  They will continue to provide such services if they want to, and
  I am sure, give the views expressed here, that they will continue
  to want to.

Our problem is that the requirement of unqualified Dublin Core causes 
the metadata to be EXTREMELY INACCURATE to the point of it almost rendering
our reporting useless.  My frustration is that I feel "stuck" in a 
schema that wasn't built to be extendable and that doesn't (apparently)
have a way to self-correct to handle situations where items don't fit
the limited preconceived notion of what items were expected to be in a
particular repository without resorting to a "bash the square peg into
the round hole anyway" approach.

In our repository, many of the digital assets are video.  However due to 
extreme short-sightedness on some group's part, video isn't included in the
list of media formats and is deprecated to "image".  So, anyone finding
our collection through (for example) the NSDL gets the first impression
that we're a collection of still images and a few documents.   This hinders
our efforts considerably.  I don't think anyone would say this isn't a
fundamental problem.

Furthermore, the list of elements in *unqualified* DC is insufficient to
adequately describe digital assets, particularly multimedla.  My intent
has been to "just" support oai_dc because I had to, then find a metadata
format that actually works.  Dumping oai_dc for either a "new and improved"
version (i.e., one that permits higher accuracy in descriptions) or 
another default metadata system is preferable to clinging to an outmoded
system that's already obsolete and a poor fit to the contents of many
repositories.   Along with the addage "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"
should be inscribed "if it doesn't work, DON'T CLING TO IT ANYWAY".  :-)

I guess the way to placate both camps (or leave them equally frustrated)
would be to create an "extended" oai_dc replacement within which "classic" oai_dc will work without alteration.  The extensions would provide the
means to extend the metadata to encompass new media types (and several
older ones), and more freedom to make changes in the future.  I can't
see a standards using DC working without qualifications, myself.

I think this is an example of what a previous poster referred to as 
'one person's piece of coal being another person's diamond'

To me it seems like a huge benefit that information about the video holdings
of www.teachersdomain.com (including title, description, creator info, and
URL) are accessible through an aggregator like NSDL.

It is a relatively minor point that the DC metadata classifies them  as
being of type "image", especially since:
 (a) it's surely better for them to be listed by NSDL than not listed at all
(which might well be the case if NSDL did not have a baseline format to rely
on)
 (b) the description will presumably make very clear that they are videos.
 (c) the Dublin Core spec clearly states that the Type 'Image' applies to
visual material including both 'still images' and 'moving images', which
seems fair enough, and reasonably logical.

http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/

Sure, an end user not familiar with Dublin Core might incorrectly assume the
term 'Image' refers to only still images, but that is a presentation issue.
NSDL should certainly be aware of how the DC controlled vocabulary is
defined, and so they might well choose, for example, to refer use a more
human-friendly description of the Image type, and call it:
'Images, videos, animations etc'.

As Dublin Core and other metadata standards evolve, it may be that the
OAI-PMH can evolve to *recommend* the support of various other metadata
standards, in addition to the baseline.

But that wouldn't negate the huge benefit of having a baseline format that
is not just recommended but required for compliance.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Re: Reconsidering mandatory DC in OAI-PMH
In-Reply-To: <-1151963745bob_donahue@wgbh.org>
Message-ID: <E19kOKL-000I8e-MP@serenity.mcc.ac.uk>

My opinion on DC within OAI-PMH is that it should be retained as 
either mandatory or very-strongly-recommended. Because it 
provides basic interoperability at a simple resouce 
description/discovery level. Most resouces will have a title and 
identifiers.

But as others have pointed out, there should be encouragement to 
provide other richer metadata formats appropriate to the particular 
domain.

I'm answering this particular email really to put the record straight 
on DC types. It may not be very widely known yet. At the most 
recent meeting of the DC Usage Board it was agreed to include two 
new types in the DCMI Type Vocabulary: Moving Image and Still 
Image. (The existing Image type will be retained because it is 
already in use.) Definitions of these new types will become 
available when the DC Terms documentation is next updated.

However, the DCMI Type Vocabulary is not really part of simple 
DC. In simple DC the value of a property is just a text string. In 
order to indicate that a value of dc:type is using the DCMI Type 
Vocabulary you need to say 'xsi:type="DCMIType"' which is 
qualified DC.

Of course you can choose to include tems like 'Text', 'Image' as 
the value of the dc:type property in simple DC, but simple DC itself 
doesn't require it. It is perfectly valid in simple DC to have:
<dc:type>car</dc:type>.

Some of the discussion I've seen over the last day or so incline me 
to think that the use of simple DC in oai_dc is already being used 
with an assumption of qualified DC restrictions for some elements. 
Which inclines me to wonder if OAI-PMH should include some 
recommendation for oai_qdc as well.

NSDL search limits use a combination of the DC Type and DC format
fields, 
so if materials are identified as video in the format element, the items
will appear properly as "video", even if Image is in the Type element 
(the current DC recommendation).

The above implies that the NSDL *is* able to distinguish items as
videos.

As for concerns about what *can't* be expressed with oai_dc:  oai_dc is
*simple* DC.  Anyone is always welcome to provide metadata in qualified
DC or in any other rich format, in *addition* to simple DC.   The NSDL
prefers to harvest qualified DC, but most sites only provide us with
oai_dc.

So if simple DC doesn't meet your needs, serve an additional format.  

Both DCMI (www.dublincore.org) and the NSDL have schemas for qualified
DC. 

	http://www.dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/  

      http://metamanagement.comm.nsdlib.org/record_examples.html  Follow
the schema chains (xsi:schemaLocation) to find the schemas for nsdl_dc.

Thanks to people who responded to my (probably too-strongly

handle the system which I'll definitely investigate.  Also,
I was informed that adding Video as a recognized type IS in

Subject: [OAI-implementers] DOI and OAI experiences anyone?
Message-ID: <20030807000828.GA9021@io.mds.rmit.edu.au>

Hi,

I have been reading up recently on DOI a bit more closely, and looking
and the 'Handle System' (www.handle.net). I was wondering what experiences
there were out there. Maybe this is what D-space and similar projects
address. The specific situation I am trying to come up with a "good"
solution for is below. But I am interested in generic solutions and
the "best" way to solve these sorts of problems as I think its relevant
in all sorts of situations. Sorry, the following wanders around a bit
before it gets back to OAI.

I actually started looking at SCORM. The idea of SCORM is you develop
small reusable units of learning material (lets call them a 'lesson')
and then assemble larger 'courses' etc from those units. SCORM talks
about 'content repositories' but does not really seem to have addressed
the issues properly (yet). I was looking at it from a utopian point of
view (not worrying about implementation practicalities).

SCORM uses XML encoded metadata (based on IMS) to describe each reusable
unit. Good stuff for searching. It even recommends a way to bundle up
a set of files into a single ZIP file to down load. So you end up with
single files that have XML encoded metadata describing the content of
the file.

Each unit however needs to make references to other units. For example,
courses need to reference lessons. You can use a HTTP URL to point to
it on some site, but this is pretty location specific.

For example, consider a University A that authors SCORM material with
copyright restrictions that it sells rights to for other organisations.
Or they may only publish the metadata on their web site (or via OAI).
University B buys a subset of the material (eg: two courses where some
of the lessons in that course are shared between different courses).
To avoid network bills etc, University B wants to locate all the content
locally - they dont want to access the material directly from University A's
web site.

So it makes sense to me to use a location independent identification
scheme such as DOI to do references. (I guess PURLs are an option too.)

This is where it gets a bit more interesting. Within University B, it
wants to resolve the DOI to a local copy of the file. It does not want
anyone external to the University however to use that resolution. So
I guess it wants a 'DOI Proxy Server' which allows additional location
information to be associated with DOIs that it has access to (??).
Or if using PURL, you want something like a HTTP proxy server that
can intercept the reference to the external resource and redirect it
to a local copy of that resource.

So how does OAI fit in?

Well, it makes sense to me to publish the metadata records via OAI.
Then authors can publish metdata information about lessons or courses
they develop for consumers to find (and purchase etc). I was then
thinking what OAI identifier to use for the metadata records. I am
guessing it would make sense to use the DOI as the OAI identifier.

This lead me to wonder (and this is treading on thin ice!) whether
an OAI repository implementation could actually be the local cache
instead of using a special DOI or HTTP proxy server. If someone asks
for a specific identifier and its not in the local repository, go out
and try to find it and then cache the value locally. This feels a bit
unclean however - its not using OAI for its intended purpose. It also
does not address the issue of the real content (instead of just the
metadata).

Then it gets even more interesting when you don't want to rely on
having external network access. (SCORM was originally funded I believe
by DoD and I could imagine having closed environments there.) This
makes HTTP URLs to me a risky sort of way to go. So a DOI handle
server that can run standalone or connected to the Internet, that can
add local information to information returned by public hosts?

Is this the whole idea of digital libraries in the first place?

Any pointers to relevant projects or papers would be greatly appreciated.
I don't want to reinvent the wheel.

hi Alan,

The issue you describe (or part thereof) is generally known as "the appropriate
copy problem", and I happen to have been involved in proposing a solution to it
which is now commonly known as the OpenURL Framework (for Context-Sensitive
Services).  I have also been involved in the creation of a specific instance of the
solution to resolve DOIs at the 'local' level.  That DOI local resolution solution
is operational, and is described in:

Information Environment Using the OpenURL Framework. 2001. D-Lib Magazine.

Regarding using the doi of the resource as the oai-identifier:

The thing to understand here, is that an oai-identifier is the identifier of the
oai "item" (as defined in the protocol document).  It is not the identifier of the
"resource" about which the oai "item" holds metadata.  The identifier of the
"resource" would typically go into dc.identifier; that is if there is a DC record
;-) .  Having said that, there are OAI repositories that do use the identifier of
the "resource" as the oai-identifier, i.e. the identifier of the "item".  If I am
not mistaken, arXiv.org does so.  I think one would have to ask the DOI gurus on
this list (Tony Hammond are you there?) how kosher it would be to do that with
DOIs.  My initial impression is that it might very well be acceptable, because the
CrossRef metadata-lookup system also uses DOIs to get after metadata, not the
resource.  Although in that case, the look-up is considered to be a specific
service for the specified DOI (if I am not mistaken - I am sure Tony Hammond will
correct me).

The following passages from the latest 'doi:' Internet-Draft

	http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-paskin-doi-uri-04.txt

may be of assistance here. Note that the 'resource' identified by a 'doi'
URI is not just a given representation (i.e. an HTML or PDF document) but is
a 'set of service descriptions' - see below. This follows the definition of
'resource' in RFC 2396 as being a 'resource is the conceptual mapping to an
entity or set of entities'. 

Tony


	"DOIs are identifiers for entities of significance to the content
industries. The "doi" URI scheme allows a resource associated with an entity
identified by a DOI to be referenced by a URI for Internet applications.  A
"doi" URI is dereferenced to a set of service descriptions through
discoverable resolution mechanisms."

...

	"A "doi" URI references a set of service descriptions which is
returned on dereference of the URI. Following such a dereference a service
description is typically selected and the corresponding service activated.
This process of service indirection is commonly referred to as "resolution"
a DOI. Examples of services that can be accessed by the resolution of a DOI
include redirection to another network resource, return of a metadata record
describing the entity identified by the DOI, etc. A discussion of such
services is beyond the scope of this document."

Message-ID: <200308101842.h7AIgUj11443@nsdlib.nsdl.cornell.edu>

The College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland is pleased 
to announce the following two e-learning, continuing education courses this 
fall. The courses are designed to be completed on your own schedule during a 
two-week time frame. 

The first course focuses on the Patriot Act and the Fourth Amendment. The 
second course helps you understand how to respond to search warrants and 
subpoenas and create a records management system. For complete details, check 
out our Web site at http://www.clis.umd.edu/ce

Government intrusion vs. Individual Liberty: Understanding the 4th Amendment 
and the USA Patriot Act
September 15-September 26, 2003 
Registration Deadline: September 1, 2003
Cost: $145

Do the terms USA Patriot Act, Homeland Security Department and Total 
Information Awareness lead to more questions than answers when it comes to 
working in an information-centric business? Do you want to understand more 
about the basics of the Fourth Amendment and whether recent legislative and 
administration efforts, not to mention technology, are eroding our right of 
individual liberty? Government Intrusion vs. Individual Liberty will examine 
such issues, how they affect information professionals, and how as citizens 
we must work to balance the need for homeland security and our rights of 
individual liberty. 

Responding to Judicial Process: 
A Guide to the Unexpected for Search Warrants, Subpoenas and Otherwise
October 27-November 7, 2003
Registration Deadline: October 13
Cost: $145

Perhaps you have taken our previous continuing education course on government 
intrusion and the changes brought by the USA Patriot Act. But regardless, 
what do you do when federal or state law enforcement comes to your 
information-centric business with judicial process and demands compliance? 
To effectively manage today, you must understand the many forms of judicial 
process -- search warrants, Title III wiretap orders, ECPA court orders, ECPA 
preservation demand letters and subpoenas  to name just a few. This popular 
course will help you understand how each of these forms of process are 
executed and what your rights are. It will also assist you in developing in 
very concrete terms the proper policy and protocol for your business to make 
certain that your rights and the rights of your patrons (or customers) are 
protected.

Hi all,

I've come late to this discussion, but I want to record my strong
preference for retaining the oai_dc requirement.

I've found the arguments made in favour of retaining the oai_dc very
convincing.  Most objections seem to misunderstand the reason oai_dc is
there, IMHO, which is to provide basic interoperability.

Many people have pointed out that they use OAI-PMH internally (as do I)
with their own schemas (as do I) and have no use for oai_dc (nor do I); or
that oai_dc does not accurately represent their resources; or that it
misrepresents their work.  I think these are reasonable objections, but
not worth sacrificing the inherent interoperability that oai_dc gives us
for.

In cases like these, I'd suggest returning empty or near-empty records to
oai_dc requersts.  The fields are optional, after all. If a client
requires more complex information, they can request a different metadata
format.

Gordon

This message tends to sum up my views as well - though, at this stage, I
would probably indicate a 'preference' rather than a 'strong preference'
in favour of keeping oai_dc.

There is no doubt in my mind that mandating oai_dc has been hugely
beneficial to the uptake and success of the OAI-PMH.  My gut feeling is
that this will continue to be true in the future as well (though I must
confess that I am much less certain about this).

As Gordon says, in cases where oai_dc is inappropriate, one can always
return a minimal oai_dc record containing, say, only dc:identifier.

Err... services based on minimal metadata plus an index of full-text
(where it is available for harvesting at the URI provided in
dc:identifier).

  These are not likely to be used or useful. I rather have
  Google index my web pages that render the full metadata
  for humans. BTW, Google have taken the business
  of resource discovery for them. We better get used to it.

  dc:identifier is the identitfier of the item, not of the 
  full text, is in not? Say I have an academic paper,
  dc:identifier should be the id of the paper, not the 
  url of the full-text?

Sure... I don't disagree.  But there's some functionality that Google
doesn't currently offer, e.g. an author search.  I cannot do Google search
for everything authored by you for example.  I also can't do a Google
search for resources of a particular type - e.g. 'research papers'.
Similarly, it is not easy to search Google for resources about a
particular geographic area - try searching Google for resources about
'Bath' for example.

An OAI-based service provider could offer such a service based on minimal
metadata (dc:creator, dc:title, dc:identifier, dc:description,
dc:coverage, dc:type) plus an index of the full-text (where it is
available). (It'd be even better if Google did this themselves!).

Now, to come back to the original point... there will be some classes of
resource for which oai_dc is not appropriate (e.g. people and
organisations) in which case one can only return a very minimal oai_dc
record (e.g. only dc:identifier).  In these cases, the service provider
will have to 'know' to ask for an alternative format if it wants to offer
a 'rich' service.  But this is also the case if oai_dc is made optional.
So I don't understand why making oai_dc optional buys us anything.

In short, making oai_dc optional loses us a lot of low-barrier
interoperability in the general case (where DC is appropriate) and doesn't
gain us anything in those more limited cases where DC is inappropriate.
So why do it?

dc:identifier is the identifier of the 'resource'.  If by 'item' you mean
OAI item then the oai_identifier is the identifier of the item.

The identifier of the paper may or may not be resolvable to the full-text.
I would hope that in general it is.  I think it would be very unhelpful if
it became the norm for providers to put an identifier into dc:identifier
that didn't resolve to the full-text.

There is a slight gatcha here however.  In

Using simple Dublin Core to describe eprints
http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/docs/simpledc-guidelines/

we recommend that dc:identifier be

 A URI or bibiographic citation for the eprint, typically the URI of the
 'jump-off page' for the eprint, as served by the archive.

There is therefore a slight hiccup for any service provider that wishes to
harvest the full-text as well as the metadata - because their robot may
have to negotiate a jump-off page.  This is slightly unfortunate, but it
represents current practice by both eprints.org and DSpace (as far as I
know).

the encoding i am using is "ISO-8859-1"  this is to support some special

You must use UTF-8, see:

I believe all of ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) is supported in Unicode with code
positions unchanged. The bytes will, of course, be different in a UTF-8
encoded stream.

Note that Microsoft's CP1252 uses codes 0x80--0xBF which aren't in Latin 1
and do require translation to different Unicode code positions, see:
ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/WINDOWS/CP1252.TXT

The OAI spec mandates that all XML responses must be encoded as UTF-8.

I believe that every character from ISO-8859-1 has a Unicode point so you 
should be able to encode them as UTF-8 with some translation.

here's an example of a record that has a special character.  i'm not if
i'm handling it correctly.  can anyone confirm?

hi

i just wanted to point out that if you use Perl, my VTOAI Perl template 
for data providers (available on OAI website) includes a module 
(Utility.pm) that does 8859/1=>Unicode conversions (along with basic 
de-microsoftification and de-htmlisation).

ttfn,
----hussein

ps. i dont know if your record encoding is correct or not, but it didnt 
throw up any errors when i loaded it.

You have "mus\'ee" in the title and the e acute is not UTF-8 encoded. You
have

0xE9	0x00E9	#LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE

You might find my little utf8conditioner code helpful for checking
(http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/simeon/software/utf8conditioner/)
your UTF8 output:

simeon@ice ~>cat oai.xml | ~/src/utf8/utf8conditioner -c
Line 22, char 1181, byte 1181: byte 2 isn't continuation: 0xE9 0x65, restart at 0x65, substituted 0x3F

The correct UTF-8 encoding for character code E9 is the two byte 
sequence C3 A9.

Cheers,
Simeon

While we're on the topic, I have records with the name Niccolò in them (as in 
Machiavelli) -- there's a grave accent over the final "o". But this doesn't 
seem to be part of UTF-8, or your conditioner doesn't recognise it. (Although 
it displays correctly everywhere.)

Is this invalid in UTF-8, or ... what?

When I dump it in Unix, the character is \xf2, apparently.


Steve

0xF2 is NOT a valid UTF-8 sequence.

No single byte in the range 0x80--0xFF is a valid UTF-8 sequence. 0xF2 is
the Latin 1, CP1252 and Unicode code for o grave and is represented as a
two-byte sequence in UTF-8 (0xC3 0xB2).

If you have data in Latin 1 it is trivial to convert that to UTF-8 but you
must do the conversion before writing XML records for OAI use!


There seems to be some confusion about these issues so I'll attempt to
summarize a few key points:

o UTF-8 is a particular ENCODING of Unicode (UCS, ISO 10646). Individual
characters are represented by a sequence of between 1 and 6 bytes. Any
byte >= 0x80 is part of a multi-byte sequence.

o The ASCII characters (0x20-0x7F) have the same codes in Latin 1 (aka ISO
8859-1) and Unicode. They are also represented by single bytes with the
same values in a UTF-8 stream.

o The Latin 1 characters (0xC0-0xFF) have the same codes in Unicode. In
UTF-8 streams they are encoded as two-byte sequences. (Direct inclusion of
these codes in UTF-8 will likely result in invalid UTF-8 sequences and
will certainly not be correctly interpreted.)

o Almost every other character set can be mapped to Unicode but may 
require look-up-tables. 

o There are libraries and tools to do character set conversion and 
encoding in most common languages. For example, perl permits quite general 
conversion; say latin1 to utf8:
  #see http://search.cpan.org/author/JHI/perl-5.8.0/ext/Encode/Encode.pm
  use Encode; 
  $utf8data = encode("utf8", decode("iso-8859-1", $latin1data));

For more details see:
  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html (FAQ)
  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt (UTF-8)
  http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html (Unicode)


I hope this helps.

Cheers,
Simeon.

Message-ID: <200308281718.h7SHI2j28428@nsdlib.nsdl.cornell.edu>

Do the terms USA Patriot Act, Homeland Security Department and Total 
Information Awareness lead to more questions than answers when it comes to 
working in an information-centric business? Do you want to understand more 
about the basics of the Fourth Amendment and whether recent legislative and 
administration efforts, not to mention technology, are eroding our right of 
individual liberty? 

The College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland is pleased 
to announce an e-learning, continuing education course that answers these and 
other questions about how the Patriot Act affects information professionals. 
The course, which runs September 15-26, is designed to be completed on your 
own schedule during a two-week time frame. It is taught by visiting professor 
Lee Strickland, a career CIA official and legal expert on librarian and 
information management related issues. For complete details, check out our 
Web site at http://www.clis.umd.edu/ce

The key dates follow: 
Government intrusion vs. Individual Liberty: Understanding the 4th Amendment 
and the USA Patriot Act
