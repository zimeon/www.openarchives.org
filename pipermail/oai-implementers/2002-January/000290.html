Open archives are great, and a common protocol is a good idea.
I haven't looked at the OAI protocol yet.

Metadata-only indexes have some serious weaknesses. They almost
require a separate thesaurus with lots of entry terms, and even
then, they won't handle searches for secondary characteristics,
like names of characters in fiction.

Metadata+fulltext is much more powerful.

For example, the &quot;Celebration of Women Writers&quot; collection is good,
but the metadata is minimal. The Caltech Thesis collection has nice, big
descriptions, which gives a bigger &quot;target&quot; for matching user queries.

For &quot;celebration&quot;, I'd recommend indexing the source documents instead.

Good metadata is very expensive, so we only see that on high-investment
documents, like public techreports. Even then, I've seen some surprisingly
sloppy index keywords (&quot;IR&quot; in one report, &quot;Information Retrieval&quot; in
the next).

&gt;<i> 2.  DP9 is great for spiders that don't know any better, but what are the
</I>&gt;<i> chances of &quot;OAI-aware&quot; spiders?  Or is that such a special case that its
</I>&gt;<i> not worth accounting for...
</I>
Part of the answer is &quot;how much will people pay for that?&quot;
Another part is &quot;how hard is it to implement?&quot;
And then there is &quot;how much fun is it?&quot;

I don't have the answer to any of those right now.

&gt;<i> ... Of course, this is a good substitute:

</I>
For spiders, that should be broken into smaller pages, with around
1000 links each. Big pages with tons of links can cause problems.
Perhaps a page for each year.

And you need the HTML pages anyway, for humans to view.
