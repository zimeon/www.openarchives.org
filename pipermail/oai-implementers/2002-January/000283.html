<PRE>Would somebody be able to supply some information (or provide a link to some
existing information) that explains how to set up sets. I have read the
protocol document but it doesn't explain how sets are implemented.
As far as I can make out a set could just be a directory. However, if a
record belongs in more than one set (eg the sets are grouped by institutions
(as in the protocol) AND subject then there is the potential for records to
be duplicated - making it difficult to ensure that all records about a
particular resource are synchronised.
The protocol states that the &quot;repository's set hierarchy is represented in
the protocol via setSpecs&quot;. However, it dosn't state how to define a
setSpec. Any help on this topic would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Gul Akbar.
