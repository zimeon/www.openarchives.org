<PRE>I am writing a Java program to harvest data from remote sites. I am using
the COGPrints site (<A HREF="http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/perl.oai">http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/perl.oai</A>) as a test. I have
also tried many other sites (as listed in the Repository Explorer). When the
Java program tries to connect to the site it throws a
java.net.ConnectException with the message Conection refused.
I am displaying the URL that the program is using and when I paste this into
the browser then the records are returned correctly. If I use the program to
harvest data from our own repository (only available over a LAN at the
moment) then there isn't a problem.
I'm wondering if the problem is an .htaccess file is refusing the Java
program entry to the site?

Any ideas would be extremely welcome,

Thanks in advance,

David Letts
