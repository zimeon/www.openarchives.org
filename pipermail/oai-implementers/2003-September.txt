Subject: [OAI-implementers] RSS available from my.OAI
Message-ID: <BB809A7C.FA57%francois@fsconsult.com>

Hi

A few months ago, I asked if there was interest for an RSS interface to
my.OAI ( http://www.myoai.com/ ).

I got very positive feedback from people and (finally) two weeks ago, I
implemented RSS on my.OAI, feel free to check it out. It seems to work well
so far though I have only tried it with Radio UserLand and NetNewsWire.

my.OAI is updated once a week so if you set up an RSS feed from a search,
you will only see changes once a week. If that is an issue for people, I can
switch the update to once a day since I now have the computing power to
support that.

I also asked about SOAP and there was a good suggestion in using SRW for my
SOAP interface:

  http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/srw/

But no-one stepped up saying they would actually use such an interface, so I
am leaving it for now. You could also say that I have been slow in providing
the RSS interface, but I have been busy with other projects such as Feedster
( http://www.feedster.com/ ).

Cheers

Francois

Hi everyone,
=20
I'm currently working on a 4th year Computer Science project at the =
University of Cape Town in South Africa, under the supervision of =
Hussein Suleman.
=20
Our project involves investigating the applicability of the SOAP =
messaging framework (version .2) to OAI-PMH.  I am developing a tool =
which enables one to test a repository for conformance to the new =
experimental encoding as well the original encoding of OAI-PMH v2.0.  =
This tool is completely self-contained and runs on your machine as a =
Java application, which should make it more useful in some instances =
than central tools like the Repository Explorer.
=20
I am nearing the end of my work and would appreciate if anyone =
interested would download the tool and try it out.  Any feedback =
(positive or negative) would be greatly appreciated and would help me to =
locate any errors or omissions.

Please note that the experimental encoding has been disabled in this =
version of the tool as it is still under development, and thus only =
OAI-PMH v2.0 can be used.
=20
The tool can be downloaded at the following location:

www.cs.uct.ac.za/~bmerchan/Testtool.zip

Subject: [OAI-implementers] 'info' URI Internet-Draft
Message-ID: <3F78581A.71B84419@lanl.gov>

Apologies for cross-posting

Announcing a new Internet-Draft for an Informational RFC, to allow commonly used
identifiers to be part of the Web:

  The "info" URI Scheme for Information Assets with Identifiers in Public
Namespaces

      Herbert Van de Sompel - Los Alamos National Laboratory
      Tony Hammond – Elsevier
      Eamonn Neylon - Manifest Solutions
      Stuart L. Weibel – OCLC Online Computer Library Center

The draft is available at:

  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vandesompel-info-uri-00.txt

a. Purpose of the "info" URI scheme:

There exist many information assets with identifiers in public namespaces that
are not referenceable by URI schemes. Examples of such namespaces include Dewey
Decimal Classifications [1], Library of Congress Control Numbers (LCCN) [2],
NASA Astrophysics Data System Bibcodes [3], and Open Archives Initiative (OAI)
identifiers [4], among others.  The "info" URI scheme will facilitate the
referencing of information assets that have identifiers in such public
namespaces by means of URIs. The "info" scheme is based on a Registry that
invites the registration of public namespaces used for the identification of
information assets, by the parties that maintain the namespaces.

For example, assuming that the namespace of Dewey Decimal Classifications (ddc:)
and the namespace of Library of Congress Control Numbers (lccn:) would be
registered by their respective authorities, then:

* the Dewey Decimal Classification 22/eng//004.678 (for the term "Internet")
could be expressed as the "info" URI <info:ddc/22/eng//004.678>

* the Library of Congress Control Number 2002022641 could be expressed as the
"info" URI <info:lccn/2002022641>

b. Background of this effort

The effort to create the "info" URI scheme emerged from the NISO process to
standardize the OpenURL Framework for context-sensitive services [5], which
requires the ability to describe resources by means of globally recognizable
identifiers.  The Draft Standard for Trial Use released for Public Comment
introduced a "proprietary" naming architecture which allowed information assets
to be referenced by means of widely used non-URI identifiers (e.g. PubMed
identifiers, Digital Object Identifiers, Astrophysics Datasystem Bibcodes, and
others) which would be registered under the OpenURL Framework.

Public feedback led to the decision to fundamentally revise the naming
architecture, and to base all resource identification requirements within the
OpenURL Framework on URIs alone.  Because it was deemed unreaslistic to expect
that all namespaces required in the OpenURL Framework would be registered within
the URI allocation by the respective namespace authorities, the "info" URI
effort was launched.  This work is being conducted under the auspices of NISO,
and with active involvement and consultation from the IETF and the W3C.  It is
hoped that the lightweight, and community-based, registration mechanism that
will underlie the "info" URI scheme will rapidly lead to the availability of
"info" URIs to identify a wide variety of information assets.  More detailed
information of the effort is available at [6].
