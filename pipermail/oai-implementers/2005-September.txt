	Information Science
Message-ID: <20050907160732.GA4608@openlib.org>

Announcement [crossposted]

First Workshop on Eprints in Library and Information Science

22 October, 2005 from 13:45 to 19:00
Council Chamber, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

The workshop takes place right after the CERN workshop on Innovations
in Scholarly Communication OAI4 http://oai4.web.cern.ch/OAI4/. It
is sponsored by CERN, CILEA and the Polytechnic University of Valencia.
The meeting is followed by a reception. 

The workshop is for activists, friends and folks who want to find out
more about the E-LIS eprints archive for Library and Information
Science (LIS), at http://eprints.rclis.org.  E-LIS was formed in 2003
to further the open archiving of papers in LIS and related fields. It
is an open-access international eprints archive maintained by
volunteers. It has grown spectacularly well. At the time of writing
almost 3000 eprints have been archived.

At the workshop the E-LIS community will discuss technical details of
E-LIS and organizational models for the E-LIS community. Outsiders
will find it interesting to see how a really successful open archive
works.  Some efforts that are related to E-LIS will also be discussed.
This workshop will be an important contribution to the development of
open archiving within LIS scholarly communication.

Registration for this event is free, but limited to to the first 150
people. See the workshop web site at 

http://www.aepic.it/conf/index.php?cf=4 

for further details and online registration.

Message-ID: <43272880.6050601@usc.edu>


How have other people implemented "non-UTF-8" characters in their DP 
records?

Meaning, we have non-English characters that are "choking" when we test 
our Data Provider.  [Think "e" with the accent over it

Asian language character sets, as well as the current non-English 
characters.

I have looked over the protocol, looked at various tutorials, the 
oai-implementers archives, and the OAI Best Practices site, and have not 
seen any guidelines other than this thread:

http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2001-April/000093.html

I'm also looking at OLAC and some of the DP implementations in Japan, 
but have not [yet] found the solution.  [Like this: 
http://mitizane.ll.chiba-u.jp/cgi-bin/oai/oai2.0?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc 
.]

Will we just have to locate the individual characters that are choking 
and encode those a specific way?

Thanks in advance,

Hi Jewel,

UTF-8 can handle any Unicode character ("e" with an accent, and thousands
more from many languages).  As long as the encoding of the your characters
constitute valid UTF-8, you should be set.  The problem often arises when you
think you have UTF-8 to begin with, but your source data is actually using
some other encoding.  Often the problem isn't apparent until you get to the
non-ascii characters because several different encodings represent
"low-ascii" in the same way (the first few bytes).  It sounds like that might
be what's happening in your case.

If so, the best thing to do (and this is sometimes really hard) is to find
out what encoding the original provider of the file used.  If you know that,
then you can convert it to UTF-8 using a tool designed for that job[1].   If
you're unable to determine what the original encoding was, you can at least
make the file validate by replacing the odd characters with valid (though,
probably incorrect) UTF-8 ones[2].

Hi Jewel,

Perhaps I'm not understanding your question properly, but I think the
bottom line is that you have to convert whatever it is you have into
Unicode. When you know the Unicode code point you can then either write an
XML numeric entity (e.g. &#252; for code point 252(decimal)) or encode it
as a two-byte UTF-8 sequence.

In arXiv, for example, we have legacy data that uses TeX escape sequences
to represent non-ASCII characters in author names and such. Our OAI
interface has code to convert these to numeric entities. For example, the
TeX escape sequence \"u (u-umlaut) is Unicode code point 0x00FC, or 252 in
decimal which is represented as "&#252;" in the XML. You can see this in
the response from:

http://arxiv.org/oai2?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/9901140&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

My choice to use the somewhat less efficient numeric entities rather than
direct UTF-8 was motivated by debugging ease on systems where tools for
UTF-8 were not really mature.

The site you refer to, http://mitizane.ll.chiba-u.jp/, correctly uses
direct UTF-8 encodings as far as I can see. We need never know what
internal format they use (ah! the beauty of standard interfaces...).

If you have problems locating UTF-8 encoding errors in XML you might find
my little utf8conditioner program helpful:
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/simeon/software/utf8conditioner/

Cheers,
Simeon

this seems to be encoded in iso-8859-1. a unix command like this will
convert it to utf-8:

recode -v ISO-8859-1/..UTF-8 < oaidp.xml > r-oaidp.xml

(recode is GNU recode.)

thanks for all of the online and offline advice.

it appears that our data may not be "as UTF-8" as it ought to be, in 
spite of the fact that it's in an Oracle db.  we're going to re-check 
this and do some Perlin' and we'll see how the next round of testing goes.

thanks again.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Harvesting DC records for DDI system
Message-ID: <432E76F5.2040707@oucs.ox.ac.uk>

We are currently using a piece of open-source software called the 
Virtual Data Center (VDC) from Harvard that implements a complete 
digital library system for numeric data - e.g. social sciences 
quantitative research data (http://thedata.org/index.php/Main/AboutVDC). 
Whilst the system provides extensive support for federated and 
distributed collections it will currently only provide federated search 
functionality for  records in other VDC  systems however it will harvest 
metadata from other systems that implement OAI.

We would like to make the system search the UK Data Archive (UKDA) - as 
the UKDA does not use VDC we are looking at being able to harvest their 
records. The UKDA have a test OAI service but this only contains a 
reduced Dublin Core record for each of their catalogue entries and it 
seems that the VDC system will only harvest DDI metadata. Has any body 
got any experience of what would be needed to harvest DC records and put 
them into DDI. At first glance it seems that DC and DDI map pretty well.

Any advice on how this would be done and how much work it would take 
would be much appreciated.

Kate

If the needed DDI-fields are there in the DC metadata, an xslt 
transformation could be used to translate the harvested xml to the 
format you need. (I have no experience with DDI, so I can't really say 
how hard or easy this will be, but I don't think it'll be very hard). 
You could then have an intermediate server that harvests UKDA and 
provides an OAI service with the metadata in DDI. This can probably 
achieved in a lot of ways, but at least one of them is using the open 
source pyoai package (full disclosure: I work for the company who makes 
that, but it is available free of charge through cvs here: 
cvs.infrae.com/pyoai/), which provides both OAIPMH client and server 
software. Putting just a thin xslt-layer between harvester and server 
should not be that hard in Python.

Sorry, I was confused, probably due to caffeine deficiency: what I 
(should have) meant to say is: you could do this with a thin xslt layer 
that takes the xml output of the UKDA server and transforms it to DDI, 
*or* you could set up a small intermediary server that harvests UKDA and 
outputs DDI, but this would have nothing to do with xslt.

I'll be having a coffee now.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] trouble registering a static repository
Message-ID: <432EFD90.6060005@infomuse.net>

Hello,

We've developed a static repository containing records for the films 
made available through www.folkstreams.net. The xml repository document 
resides at: http://www.folkstreams.net/oai/static_repository.xml

My question is two-fold.

First, we have been able to identify only two static repository gateways 
that will allow us to register our repository: OLAC and the 
demonstration gateway at http://libtest.lanl.gov/. Our content is not 
language-related, so OLAC is not appropriate. We are unclear about the 
scope/purpose of the demonstration gateway. Is it there for permenant 
use by any repository, or is it just meant for testing purposes? 
Finally, is there a central listing of static repository gateways 
somewhere that we have missed?

Second, we have tried to register our respository with the demonstration 
gateway at http://libtest.lanl.gov/ and receive a message that our 
repository is not a valid repository.

We've tested our repository against the schema and it validates, so we 
have had trouble identifying why it is not a valid repository.

If someone could take a look at our repository ( 
http://www.folkstreams.net/oai/static_repository.xml ) and let us know 
if you see what could be causing this problem, that would be very helpful.

Thank you,

Hi Kristina,

We at UIUC have a static repository gateway which we have not widely 
advertised (until now :-)).  We currently do not respond to the initiate 
or terminate requests, but can manually add new static repositories, and 
would be happy to add your repo to the list.

We are currently hosting six repositories.  One is:
 
http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/gateway/oai.asp/ep.lib.cbs.dk/oai.xml?verb=Identify

Take a look at the friends list for the baseURLs of the other repos that 
we support.

Let me know if you would like to give our gateway a try.

Kind regards,

Tom Habing

Hi Kristina,

indeed the static xml file at
http://www.folkstreams.net/oai/static_repository.xml is valid, but the expat
parser used at the srepo backend doesn't handle the multiple namespaces
correctly. We are looking for alternatives for the next update.

Meanwhile, removing some declarations which are not strictly needed, will
allow you to submit to  http://libtest.lanl.gov/.

With regard to you second question, http://libtest.lanl.gov/ is a
demonstration service with very little active usage or maintenance at this
point. See the other response to your question for an alternative static repo
gateway.

Message-ID: <432FB85C.3040302@suub.uni-bremen.de>

Hi,

Since we are acting as an OAI-Data- and OAI-Service-Provider we are
interested in implementing special characters in our repository.
We guess that it must be possible to implement UTF-8-coded numeric
entities in the OAI2.0-interface. But how is it with superscripted
characters like <sup>2+</sup>?
These characters does not have numeric entities, so I would like to ask
you about this case.

We think, it must be possible to output the node in the way like HTML
(e.g. <sup>2%2B</sup>), because the service-provider could parse them
via XSLT-processor in an own routine.
But the characters "<" and ">" are not URI-encoded, so it would not be
possible to transfer them via the OAI-interface in the described way. If
we encode them, the XSLT-Processor cannot parse it to the HTML-node
(parsing is only possible with nodes beginning with <....>, not with
&lt;...&gt;)
So we resides in a dilemma. As a possible solution we think about
cutting them away. But on this way we would modify the content which is
not optimal for exchanging the metadata.

Has someone of you any experiences or ideas?

Greetings
Elmar

There are Unicode code points for various superscripted and subscripted 
characters in the ranges U+2070..U+209F plus U+00B2, U+00B3, and U+00B9. 
  Because of font issues, most systems cannot display more than just the 
numbers 1-3 as superscripts, but it might be adequate for your needs, 
for example, <sup>2+</sup> could be encoded as &#xB2;&#x207A;

If you need to represent more complex math in Unicode you might want to 
check out the technical report "Unicode Support for Mathematics" at 
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr25/index.html and also

Hello,
"Archeologia e Calcolatori - Published Articles"  uses Patrick
Hochstenbach's gateway at U. Ghent.
http://dor2.ugent.be/cgi-bin/gateway/gateway.cgi/www.progettocaere.rm.cnr.it/databasegestione/A_C_oai_Archive.xml?verb=Identify
It works fine. In effect, and unfortunately, at present there are not so
much Gateways around.
Our repository is based on a Access database, capable to convert its tables
in xml static repository format by a Visual Basic script.
We have also added some other services to our project, to allow Google
indexing and a local search interface. It works.
http://soi.cnr.it/archcalc/Bibliografia_new.htm. Now we are going to insert
more digital resources in the shared collection, at present listing about
400 DC metadata records, but only ten allowable resources, that OAIster
harvested succesfully. I suggest You to contact Patrick Hochstenbach that
surely could help You, as he kindly did with us.
Best regards,

Using Unicode numeric entities, something like this:

   2-(Me&#x2082;NCH&#x2083;)C&#x2086;H&#x2084;

I put together a quick test xml file at:

   http://128.174.36.55/char/test.xml

Using the Firefox web browser it looks fine with all of the subscripts 
appearing, but using IE the _6 does not appear.  I have a lot of fonts 
installed on my workstation, so your results may vary.

Another option would be to define your own metadata schema which allows 
mixed content with embedded <sub> and <sup> elements.  You could even 
define your own schema that allows MathML to be embedded in certain 
elements.  We have some experimental XML metadata schema that allow 
this, but the problem is that most OAI service providers are not 
prepared to deal with any schema beyond simple oai_dc.  Some harvesters 
are beginning to support MODS, Qualified DC, or others, but this still 
doesn't solve the problem of embedded markup such as required by 
mathematics.

Dear Thomas,

Our tangible problem is implementing a chemical summary formular like 
2-(Me_2 NCH_3 )C_6 H_4

With your help I suggest that we have now found the solution.
For exchanging the data via OAI2.0-protocol we could use the UTF-8 
characters in the described way, for representing the data we could 
transform the UTF-8 characters to HTML-nodes or -named entities (We are 
using Cocoon from Apache group, therefore there are no problems with 
specific UTF-8 characters).
We'll try to test it.

Thank you very much, Thomas!

Hi:

I'm trying to port a set of records, which are in Italian language, to
static repository XML file. Conversion goes through without any
problem. But, when I try to view the static repository file through my
browser, the following error is displayed:

An invalid character was found in text content. Error processing resource
...

Since many of the records have accented characters, my browser (IE 6.0)
treats such characters as invalid and in the process the XML file is not
displayed correctly. Could somebody please tell the way accented
characters are handled in XML?

Many thanks.
