Greetings All,

Our systems are using OAI for data exchange with various other organisations, we
are only providing access to the OAI interface via SSL and limited lists
dependant on the agreements we have with our affiliates.

We are providing our metadata in several formats, including:
 - oai_dc
 - agls  (Australian government locator service)
 - Qualified dc over rdf
 - vems 1.16 (Victorian education metadata standard v1.16)
 - vemm 2.0 (Victorian education metadata mapping v2.0)

And are happy to provide the information in any other format required, we juat
throw another xslt stylesheet at our data.

My belief is that the inclusion of oai_dc as a requirement of the protocol is
one of it's great strengths, it means that anyone who is posting the protocol to
the general public is also providing a simple and common way of extracting basic
information.  

By all means also include other formats, even your own proprietary ones to
provide full details of your content, but do also provide the oai_dc, even if
all it contains is the basic title and identifier fields for your record.

If OAI is being used as a seed protocol for internal data transfer or a
proprietory EDI system then it doesn't really matter what modifications you make
to the base protocol - as you are not expecting unknown others to have to use
the data - but if it is being exposed to the public then you have to match the
protocol exactly - and that should include the oai_dc basic requirement.
