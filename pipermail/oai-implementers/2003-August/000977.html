I think there is a slightly different crux. In the world of public
repositories, I think oai_dc is a wonderful thing to mandate. I think
the issue is people want to use the protocol in other environments.
In these other environments people want to say 'OAI-PMH conformant'.

Hence I can see the logic in breaking the current spec into two specs
as someone suggested.

(1) OAI-PMH - the protocol

(2) OAI-DC (or whatever the name is) - the conformance standard for
    public repositories. This is OAI-PMH plus oai_dc.

OAIster and all other such harvesting sites only deal with OAI-DC
conformant sites. People putting sites up as public repositories for
general harvesting must conform to OAI-DC, or else they are not a true
public repository.

These discussions have convinced me that having DC support as a standard
people can be validated against is a mandatory thing. I have not been
convinced that the protocol and oai_dc need to be in the one spec.
