<PRE>YES, it is really all of this what it is all about! IMHO!

What we need is a modular, simple and clear model - which is what OAI
and DCMI tried always to promote (and that's why it is a bit strange to
figure out now how the combination of both has been creating an
harnessed world, where people have to use &quot;dirty tricks to go around&quot;,
when what we all want is simplicity...).

José Borbinha

Assunto: Re: [OAI-implementers] Reconsidering mandatory DC in OAI-PMH


hi

i should add my strong support for this proposal from the perspective of

building componentised digital libraries.

my experiences in recent years have shown that the OAI-PMH can be very 
useful for transferring data among completely separable internal 
components of a digital library. while experimenting with the 
OAI-PMHv1.1, i had to work around a few issues, almost all of which were

subsequently resolved in OAI-PMHv2.0 (granularity, list sizes, etc.). 
currently, the biggest remaining stumbling block is the requirement for 
DC versions of records, which makes no sense in the closed environment 
of a local but componentised dl.

i believe that removing this as a requirement will enable internal (in 
addition to external) data transfers to use OAI-PMH, and will encourage 
the building of finer-grained service provision components that can be 
interconnected instead of service providers being themselves monolithic 
software systems.

also, let me add that i think Jose Borbinha's ideas are great. we really

should have some kind of registry of formats/transformations and i am 
sure these ideas have been mentioned before. there is only the issue of 
who will do it :)

philosophically, if this is done well, it could lead us closer to a &quot;one

item, one format&quot; scenario and that has positive ramifications for 
mirroring, data consistency and standardisation of mappings. on the 
whole, changing the status of dc to a recommendation is going to make 
the PMH more viable for community-based systems rather than global OAI 
search engines like the ones we have seen thus far. personally, i think 
this is the right direction in which to aim the PMH.

lastly, before you release any new versions, do note that SOAPification 
is coming sooner or later and you need to put more thought into 
separating the essence of the protocol from the binding so we dont end 
up with protocol version soup (where soup = v2.0, v2.1, v2.0/SOAP, 
v2.1/SOAP).

ttfn,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  The linkage between Dublin Core and OAI-PMH has been
</I>over-emphasized
&gt;<i> at the expense of the utility of OAI-PMH for dissemination of richer,
</I>&gt;<i> and perhaps more useful, structured data.  In some cases data
</I>providers
&gt;<i> with richer metadata (e.g., MARC, IEEE LOM) have been forced by the
</I>&gt;<i> requirement to dumb-down rich metadata to Dublin Core and have then
</I>&gt;<i> failed to provide the original metadata.  As a result, the community
</I>&gt;<i> looses the benefits of rich data and is left with the reduced
</I>semantics
&gt;<i> of Dublin Core.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We need to choose between the competing goals of protocol stability
</I>and
&gt;<i> generalization.  Although removing the Dublin Core requirement would
</I>not
&gt;<i> negatively impact existing or future data providers, it may impact
</I>&gt;<i> service providers whose applications depend on the existence of a
</I>&gt;<i> uniform metadata format.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We would like to open this subject for community discussion. While the
</I>&gt;<i> technical aspects of this change are minimal it does have considerable
</I>&gt;<i> political impact. Please give your feedback on the following proposal:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Change the Dublin Core requirement to a recommendation.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Leave oai_dc as a reserved metadataPrefix
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Move the oai_dc part of protocol document to Implementation
