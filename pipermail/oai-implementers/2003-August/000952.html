I do strongly agree with this statement. Many times, I had to go back at
the basics and try to convince people tha OAI-PMH could transport other
XML data structures then DC.

This strong association has been of great importance in the early and
rapid adoption of OAI, because it (may) remove the burden of agreeing on
data structure for exchange. But I think that since this first step in
the adoption of OAI is now done, it would not cause too much harm to
remove this constraint.

&gt;<i> generalization.  Although removing the Dublin Core 
</I>&gt;<i> requirement would not
</I>&gt;<i> negatively impact existing or future data providers, it may impact
</I>&gt;<i> service providers whose applications depend on the existence of a
</I>&gt;<i> uniform metadata format.
</I>
This is the main drawback of it. I personnaly believe that in a real
distributed, multilingual, multivocabulary environment (very realistic
today), the benefits of having a common model as limited as Dublin Core
are not that important.

&gt;<i> 1. Change the Dublin Core requirement to a recommendation.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> 2. Leave oai_dc as a reserved metadataPrefix
</I>
Yes, it should.

&gt;<i> 3. Move the oai_dc part of protocol document to Implementation
</I>&gt;<i> Guidelines
</I>
OK.
