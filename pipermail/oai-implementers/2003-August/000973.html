<PRE>If we're going to have a registry of OAI providers as Tim suggests, I would
be nice if this registry was itself OAI compliant. This would satisfy Tim's
concern about it being flat and centrally located. Naturally, though, we
would want to use oai_dc to describe the registered repositories. ;-) 

Including XSLT references in the OAI responses could give the registry a
human-readable view as was done with the OpenURL registry. Such a registry
could be updated as part of the validation/registration process currently
available on the Open Archives home page. ListSets could be used to identify
which registered repositories support which metadataFormats. Etc.

</I>&gt;<i> This is the crux of the issue. Does a harvesting service need 
</I>&gt;<i> to talk to
</I>&gt;<i> a metadata provider before beginning to harvest that provider's
</I>&gt;<i> metadata?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently with OAI-PMH the answer is no, and many of us (both 
</I>&gt;<i> providers
</I>&gt;<i> and harvesters) are glad of that since it simplifies our lives.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, once a harvesting service learns of a new provider from the
</I>&gt;<i> OAI registration list, from the Repository Explorer list, or by other
</I>&gt;<i> means, that harvesting service can start harvesting the 
</I>&gt;<i> provider knowing
</I>&gt;<i> nothing more than oai_dc and the provider's baseURL. Certainly the
</I>&gt;<i> harvesting service administrator can contact the provider 
</I>&gt;<i> administrator
</I>&gt;<i> directly, but he or she doesn't have to. For their part, OAI providers
</I>&gt;<i> don't have to be bothered by everybody who wants to harvest their
</I>&gt;<i> metadata. (I have comments from metadata providers who say this is a
</I>&gt;<i> very good thing. They don't want to have to talk to everyone who might
</I>&gt;<i> want to harvest their metadata. That's an aspect of OAI-PMH they like,
</I>&gt;<i> and one reason they're willing to tolerate requirement for oai_dc.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, while the requirement for oai_dc is not of interest in a closed
</I>&gt;<i> environment (or other settings) where negotiations about exchange
</I>&gt;<i> metadata schema are expected to take place, having a reliable lowest
</I>&gt;<i> common denominator is of critical importance if you're trying to
</I>&gt;<i> establish and maintain a large network of open, widely accessible,
</I>&gt;<i> widely distributed metadata providers, such as many of us 
</I>&gt;<i> using OAI-PMH
</I>&gt;<i> are trying to develop. There is great value for many of us in 
</I>&gt;<i> preserving
</I>&gt;<i> a strongly preferred lowest common denominator for OAI-PMH, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> afraid, if Z39.50 is anything to go by, a simple recommendation in the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol or in the Implementation Guidelines won't be sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> encouragement for some providers who really should be using oai_dc as
</I>&gt;<i> one of their formats.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, perhaps at this stage in the evolution of OAI-PMH there are other
</I>&gt;<i> ways short of the current strict requirement for oai_dc as embedded in
</I>&gt;<i> current version of the Protocol. We should pursue this possibility
</I>&gt;<i> before making a definitive decision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, an open, widely accessible network of metadata providers
</I>&gt;<i> also requires a good registration/provider discovery service. 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently
</I>&gt;<i> registration of (i.e., a means to discover) OAI providers needs more
</I>&gt;<i> work, as we're all well aware. A single, flat centralized list isn't
</I>&gt;<i> going to scale well. It's not clear what's going to happen here,
</I>&gt;<i> long-term, but the question is will some mechanism be maintained that
</I>&gt;<i> will continue to vet provider services before registering them, and in
</I>&gt;<i> particular vet their use of oai_dc? If yes, then perhaps the 
</I>&gt;<i> requirement
</I>&gt;<i> to use oai_dc as such can be dropped in the Protocol itself with the
</I>&gt;<i> replacement recommendation elaborated to explain that oai_dc 
</I>&gt;<i> is required
</I>&gt;<i> if you want to register your OAI-PMH service with the formal OAI
</I>&gt;<i> provider registration service. This would be a carrot for 
</I>&gt;<i> providers that
</I>&gt;<i> really want to be visible and widely used, the ones for which oai_dc
</I>&gt;<i> probably does make sense. Other providers operating in closed
</I>&gt;<i> environments could ignore oai_dc since they would have no interest in
</I>&gt;<i> public registration of their services. Those few providers that want
</I>&gt;<i> visibility but don't want oai_dc would have to develop 
</I>&gt;<i> alternative means
</I>&gt;<i> of making their services known, but arguably if they're dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> metadata that doesn't lend itself to oai_dc, they wouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> want to be in
</I>&gt;<i> a registry full of mostly oai_dc providers anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course this alternative approach to strongly encouraging the use of
</I>&gt;<i> oai_dc hinges on maintaining a registration system of some kind that
</I>&gt;<i> requires provider services to pass certain functional tests, including
</I>&gt;<i> the ones for oai_dc. If instead we're going to a less formal way of
</I>&gt;<i> discovering OAI providers (e.g., a friends mechanism), then 
</I>&gt;<i> there would
</I>&gt;<i> be no carrot to encourage use of oai_dc in cases where it was most
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate and anarchy would prevail as has been noted by several
</I>&gt;<i> others in earlier responses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I guess I'd like to see further consideration of a relaxation of
</I>&gt;<i> oai_dc requirement discussed in the context of the future of OAI
</I>&gt;<i> provider discovery services. Will there be a way to help 
</I>&gt;<i> providers using
</I>&gt;<i> oai_dc get enhanced visibility for doing so?
