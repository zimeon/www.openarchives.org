<PRE>I think Bob's note has a misconception about the NSDL, and I just want
to clarify it here, before misinformation is disseminated.

</I>&gt;<i> In our repository, many of the digital assets are video.  However due
</I>to
&gt;<i> extreme short-sightedness on some group's part, video isn't included
</I>in
&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> list of media formats and is deprecated to &quot;image&quot;.  So, anyone
</I>finding
&gt;<i> our collection through (for example) the NSDL gets the first
</I>impression
&gt;<i> that we're a collection of still images and a few documents.   This
</I>&gt;<i> hinders
</I>&gt;<i> our efforts considerably.  I don't think anyone would say this isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental problem.
</I>
NSDL search limits use a combination of the DC Type and DC format
fields, 
so if materials are identified as video in the format element, the items
will appear properly as &quot;video&quot;, even if Image is in the Type element 
(the current DC recommendation).

The above implies that the NSDL *is* able to distinguish items as
videos.

As for concerns about what *can't* be expressed with oai_dc:  oai_dc is
*simple* DC.  Anyone is always welcome to provide metadata in qualified
DC or in any other rich format, in *addition* to simple DC.   The NSDL
prefers to harvest qualified DC, but most sites only provide us with
oai_dc.

So if simple DC doesn't meet your needs, serve an additional format.  

Both DCMI (www.dublincore.org) and the NSDL have schemas for qualified
DC. 

	<A HREF="http://www.dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/">http://www.dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/</A>  

      <A HREF="http://metamanagement.comm.nsdlib.org/record_examples.html">http://metamanagement.comm.nsdlib.org/record_examples.html</A>  Follow
the schema chains (xsi:schemaLocation) to find the schemas for nsdl_dc.
