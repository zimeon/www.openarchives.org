<PRE>Do the terms “USA Patriot Act,” “Homeland Security Department” and “Total 
Information Awareness” lead to more questions than answers when it comes to 
working in an information-centric business? Do you want to understand more 
about the basics of the Fourth Amendment and whether recent legislative and 
administration efforts, not to mention technology, are eroding our right of 
individual liberty? 

The College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland is pleased 
to announce an e-learning, continuing education course that answers these and 
other questions about how the Patriot Act affects information professionals. 
The course, which runs September 15-26, is designed to be completed on your 
own schedule during a two-week time frame. It is taught by visiting professor 
Lee Strickland, a career CIA official and legal expert on librarian and 
information management related issues. For complete details, check out our 
Web site at <A HREF="http://www.clis.umd.edu/ce">http://www.clis.umd.edu/ce</A>

The key dates follow: 
Government intrusion vs. Individual Liberty: Understanding the 4th Amendment 
and the USA Patriot Act
September 15-September 26, 2003 
Registration Deadline: September 1, 2003
Cost: $145
