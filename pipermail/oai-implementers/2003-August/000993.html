This message tends to sum up my views as well - though, at this stage, I
would probably indicate a 'preference' rather than a 'strong preference'
in favour of keeping oai_dc.

There is no doubt in my mind that mandating oai_dc has been hugely
beneficial to the uptake and success of the OAI-PMH.  My gut feeling is
that this will continue to be true in the future as well (though I must
confess that I am much less certain about this).

As Gordon says, in cases where oai_dc is inappropriate, one can always
return a minimal oai_dc record containing, say, only dc:identifier.
