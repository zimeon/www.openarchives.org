0xF2 is NOT a valid UTF-8 sequence.

No single byte in the range 0x80--0xFF is a valid UTF-8 sequence. 0xF2 is
the Latin 1, CP1252 and Unicode code for o grave and is represented as a
two-byte sequence in UTF-8 (0xC3 0xB2).

If you have data in Latin 1 it is trivial to convert that to UTF-8 but you
must do the conversion before writing XML records for OAI use!


There seems to be some confusion about these issues so I'll attempt to
summarize a few key points:

o UTF-8 is a particular ENCODING of Unicode (UCS, ISO 10646). Individual
characters are represented by a sequence of between 1 and 6 bytes. Any
byte &gt;= 0x80 is part of a multi-byte sequence.

o The ASCII characters (0x20-0x7F) have the same codes in Latin 1 (aka ISO
8859-1) and Unicode. They are also represented by single bytes with the
same values in a UTF-8 stream.

o The Latin 1 characters (0xC0-0xFF) have the same codes in Unicode. In
UTF-8 streams they are encoded as two-byte sequences. (Direct inclusion of
these codes in UTF-8 will likely result in invalid UTF-8 sequences and
will certainly not be correctly interpreted.)

o Almost every other character set can be mapped to Unicode but may 
require look-up-tables. 

o There are libraries and tools to do character set conversion and 
encoding in most common languages. For example, perl permits quite general 
conversion; say latin1 to utf8:
  #see <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/author/JHI/perl-5.8.0/ext/Encode/Encode.pm">http://search.cpan.org/author/JHI/perl-5.8.0/ext/Encode/Encode.pm</A>
  use Encode; 
  $utf8data = encode(&quot;utf8&quot;, decode(&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;, $latin1data));

For more details see:

  <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt</A> (UTF-8)
  <A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html">http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html</A> (Unicode)


I hope this helps.

Cheers,
Simeon.
