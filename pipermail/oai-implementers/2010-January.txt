Subject: [OAI-implementers] Schema for qualified Dublin Core
Message-ID: <A8B650AC21164043AAC7EE5DB9C2B175@SUB00081>

Hello,

I would like to present data in a (modified?) version of qualified Dublin
Core or in the form of a DC-based application profile.
Is there something like a "standard scheme" available somewhere that is used
beyond very specialized communities?
In the archive of the mailing list I only found a thread from 5 years ago,
and probably something has come up in the meantime...

Thanks in advance for any hints
Thomas

Subject: [OAI-implementers] DCSV content schema validation
In-Reply-To: <A8B650AC21164043AAC7EE5DB9C2B175@SUB00081>
Message-ID: <9B4BAD2EC42B47699E72691C149FC3F4@idtech.it>

Hello,

I would like to represent data in DCSV format but I am afraid that there's
no chance to validate DCSV elements schema.
As a trivial example consider the schema for a person 

<person ..some schema>
   <firstname>Giuseppe<firstname>
   <lastname>Ielpa</lastname>
   <swiftcode>xcf4554sd</swiftcode>
</person>

to be flattened into DCSV

<data ..some schema>
	<dcsvperson>FIRSTNAME=Giuseppe;
LASTNAME=Ielpa;SWIFTCODE=xcf4554sd</dcsvperson>
</data>


How can I check via XSD validation that the DCSV element dcsvperson is a
valid person?

Thanks in advance

Giuseppe Ielpa

Spam. I trust everyone knows better than to follow links in that mail.
