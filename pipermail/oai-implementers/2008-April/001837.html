Hi Lisa,

The OAI-PMH is pretty explicit about not doing what you're asking.  The
OAI-PMH datestamps are about when the record was added (or updated) in the
repository.  The publication date (or discovery date, or ...) is reflected
in the metadata you are exporting.  People that harvest your metadata will
index the publciation date and throw the OAI-PMH datestamps away -- they
exist only to support harvesting.

Here is a scenario on why you don't want to set your OAI-PMH datestamps to
your publication date.

- 2008-04-11, you initially publish 500,000 records.  They have OAI-PMH
datestamps of 1985-01-01 through 2008-04-11.

- 2008-04-12, I discover your site for the first time and do a baseline
harvest.  I get all your metadata records (since I haven't harvested you
before).  My harvester decides to revist your site every week and ask
what's new.

- 2008-04-14, you publish 100,000 more records with datestamps of
1981-01-01 through 1984-12-31.

- 2008-04-19, I return to your site and say:

?verb=ListRecords&amp;metadatPrefix=abc&amp;from=2008-04-12

Now my harvester will miss your 100,000 new records since they were added
&quot;earlier&quot; in time and not later.

In summary, be honest about your datestamps or people will miss your
updates.  Harvesters / service providers won't confuse datestamps with
publication dates.

regards,

Michael
