	provider
Message-ID: <C5893507.234C7%khage@umich.edu>

We've made some changes to the University of Michigan OAI data provider.
    http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/o/oai/oai

The data provider now reflects the fact that we are providing records from
the HathiTrust Digital Library (http://www.hathitrust.org/), formerly called
MBooks. The HathiTrust Digital Library contains Google-digitized books and
journals from a consortium of institutions including the University of
Michigan.

Consequently, OAI sets that were originally named "mbooks" are now named
"hathitrust". Please change your harvesting protocols to reflect this.

In addition, we have modified the MARC and oai_dc formats to correct and
amplify the information we are providing, based on feedback from those who
have harvested us in the past. For instance, the 245 field now includes the
statement of responsibility (subfield c). We hope the records will be more
useful as a result.

Please contact me with any questions.
Regards,
 -Kat

submission has been extended to January 29: NEW DATE!

ELPUB 2009 - Final Call for Papers - NEW DEADLINE January 29, 2009 
(abstract submission)
Rethinking Electronic Publishing : Innovation in Communication 
Paradigms and Technologies
13th International Conference on Electronic Publishing

10 - 12 June 2009, Milan, Italy
http://www.elpub.net
elpub2009@elpub.net

Electronic publishing via the Internet is continuously changing its 
shapes and models, challenging traditional players to adapt to new 
contexts. Innovative technologies enable individuals, scholars, 
communities and networks to establish contacts, exchange data, 
produce information, share knowledge. Open access sources and 
commercial players make contents available for a heterogeneous 
audience in a diversity of environments. The ELPUB 2009 conference 
will focus on key issues in e-communications, exploring dissemination 
channels, business models, technologies, methods and concepts.

See website for detailed author instructions: http://www.elpub.net. 
All submissions are subject to peer review (double-blind) and 
accepted by the international ELPUB Programme Committee. Accepted 
full papers will be published in the conference proceedings. Printed 
proceedings are distributed during the conference. Electronic 
versions of the contributions will be archived at: 
http://elpub.scix.net and indexed by the major indexing agents.

ELPUB 2009 and OAI 6 are just 3 days in time and 400 km in space (4 
hours by train, 50 minutes by plane) away from each other: take this 
unique chance to participate in both, enjoying two exciting 
scientific events in electronic publishing and scholarly 
communication and visiting Italy and Switzerland.

University of Michigan and OCLC form partnership to ensure long-term access to OAIster database

DUBLIN, Ohio, USA, 21 January 2009-The University of Michigan and OCLC today announced that they have formed a partnership that will ensure continued public access to open-archive collections through the OAIster database, and will expand the visibility of these collections to millions of information seekers through OCLC services.

Under the partnership, OAIster.org will continue to function as the public interface to OAIster collections, through funding provided by OCLC to the University of Michigan. Later in 2009, metadata harvesting operations will transfer from the University of Michigan to OCLC.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Set memberships
Message-ID: <3A64F00283EF43A0A9C83E298FB2E24B@SUB00081>

Hello,

I was wondering if there are specific rules regarding the structure and
exhibition of set membership for single items.
I am dealing with sets
- dnb:sg510
- dnb:online
- dnb:online:sg510
- dnb:online:dissertations
- dnb:online:dissertations:sg510
and was wondering if all set memberships should be included in the record,
e.g. if for an element of dnb:online:sg510 membership in
dnb:online:dissertations:sg510 should be recorded.

I'm grateful for any help.

Best regards
Thomas Fischer

":" designates a general filtering hierarchy, not the special one
you might get when intersecting more and more simple sets named
"dnb", "sg510" and so on (of course, *I* know the filter hierarchy
in the repository you're taking your example from are constructed
exactly this way    ;-)   .

Thus "sg510" in "dnb:online:sg510" is (in the OAI set sense) in
no way related to the "sg510" in "dnb:online:dissertations:sg510"
or "dnb:sg510" from your example. And any (hypothetical) permutation
of the components of "dnb:online:dissertations:sg510" would yield
potentially unrelated sets (assuming they are provided at all by
the repository).

The only thing implicit is that by the filter hierarchy both
"dnb:online:sg510" and "dnb:online:dissertations:sg510" are
members of their common supersets "dnb:online" and "dnb", these two
(and also "dnb:online:dissertations") should not be included in the record.
