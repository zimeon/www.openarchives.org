*Apologies for cross-posting*

Dear Colleagues

Globethics.net intends to harvest all ethics related metadata from
open repositories around the world and interpolate the same as part of
the digital library. We feel that this would be a great service towards
fulfilling the information and knowledge needs and exchange for the
global ethics community. In so doing, we have studied few alternatives
and solutions, as given below:

1. OAI-PMH 2.0 specification and implementation guidelines:
The original OAI-PMH 2.0 specification and implementation guideline for
'service providers' like harvesters/aggregators provides steps towards
implementing harvesting engine. The only way to provide subject (or
keyword) related metadata retrieval, according to this guideline, is to
specify the subject in the Set. A closer examination in the set-spec,
as available in the ROAR
(http://roar.eprints.org/) tells us that 'ethics'
as subject does not appear in the data providers that I have surveyed
so far. The conclusion is that using OAI-PMH 2.0 implementation
guidelines we will not be able to harvest metadata in this domain in an
optimal fashion.

2. The second strategy is the strategy followed by AVANO -
http://www.ifremer.fr/avano/ - a harvester in the domain of aquatic and
marine sciences. Essentially, they aggregate all the metadata in a
temporary (internal) database, run a search query and then interpolate
the relevant records onto their AVANO public interface. This is a
advantageous proposition for subject-specialist harvester, but we are
constrained by resources to implement this strategy.

3. The third way, which I have not found any implementation example so
far, is to take the relevant metadata from already existing global
harvesters like OAI and interpolate into Globethics..net server. The
current global harverster that we are examining are - OAISTER and
Scientific Commons. However, I would like to know the possible
standardized mechanisms by which we can take relevant (searching with 
the word 'ethics' in Scientific Commons gets 75000+ records) metadata from
these harvestors and ingest in our database.

Thank you for your time to reflect on this issues.

Hello Atanu,

The best method for accessing what you need from OAIster is to do
appropriate searches* , determine which repositories have records that will
suit your purposes (column on the left side of the results page), and then
ask me for a list of the OAI baseURLs of those repositories. Alternatively,
you can try and find those repositories at:
http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry, but asking me may prove easier and
faster.

* e.g., a search for "ethic*" in the Subject field in OAIster yields 10,417
records, but that may be too narrow a search for you

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Regards,
 -Kat

Dear Atanu,

Avano <http://www.ifremer.fr/avano/> is indeed a thematic OAI harvester 
for aquatic and marine science.

Then Avano harvests a few repositories from different aquatic sciences 
research institutes. All resources stored in those specialized 
repositories are systematically and automatically referenced in Avano. 
But only 20% of the records available via Avano come from harvesting of 
these aquatic repositories.

Avano also interrogates a group of Open Archives not specialized in 
aquatic sciences which contain relevant resources. This is the case for 
the PubMed Central server, which specializes in biomedical sciences and 
life sciences, provides more than 18.000 records are relevant to Avano?s 
research fields.

In theory, the thematic harvesting of a repository should be made 
possible by using the Set option of the OAI-PMH protocol. Nevertheless, 
in reality, we have never found any ?Marine and Aquatic Sciences? Set in 
any of the harvested repositories. In order to filter those 
repositories, we have developed a research system based on key-words and 
key-expressions related to aquatic sciences.

To process repositories that are not perfectly categorized within our 
fields of interest, Avano uploads all of their records in a temporary 
database.

Those data are indexed before a daily automatic system searches for 
about 100.000 scientific names of aquatic species in the record. For 
example, if a record contains the character string Crassostrea gigas 
(scientific name of an oyster species), we consider that there is hardly 
any chance that this name is used in a different context than our field 
of interest, so it will be automatically visible in Avano.

Avano also searches for a few hundred of more general terms and 
expressions related to the aquatic environment. For example, Avano 
searches for the words fish, marine, fishing, water treatment... Records 
spotted by this key-word system are then manually validated by 
librarians before they can be viewed via Avano. To validate those 
records, librarians use a specific website. Key-words found in records 
are highlighted. This system allows librarians to reject index files 
when key-words are not related to their fields of interest (for example 
when FISH is used for fluorescence in situ hybridization).

Of course, this method is far from being ideal:
- This method partially relies on a manual sorting of the records which 
requires some time (a few minutes per day to filter the new files among 
the 150 repositories already recorded, plus extra time to process the 
back-log when new repositories are recorded).
- As we do not spend more than 2 or 3 seconds to either validate a file 
or not, we may accept a low percentage of records that are not related 
to Avano?s fields of interest?

Kind regards,
Fred

Dear Fred, Kate, All,

Thank you for providing us with alternative methodologies. We are
validating different options and would come back to you once we define
appropriate possibilities at our end.

Best regards
Atanu

(Apologies for Cross Posting)

Make a place in your diaries for the next OAI workshop: OAI6, the 6th
Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication, which will be held
in Geneva, Switzerland:

Wednesday 17th to Friday 19th June 2009.

The workshop will follow the successful format of previous workshops
mixing practical tutorials, presentations from cutting-edge projects and
research, discussion groups, posters, and an intense social programme to
maximise interaction and communication. It will be possible to register
for a part or all of the programme.

The workshop is aimed at those involved in the development of open
access (OA) repositories and who can influence the direction of
developments either within their institution, their country or at an
international level - that includes technical developers of OA
bibliographic databases and connected services, research information
policy developers at university or library level, funding bodies
concerned with access to the results of their research, OA publishers,
and influential researchers keen to lead OA developments in their own
field.

Previous workshops have built a strong community spirit and the event is
a unique opportunity to exchange ideas and contact details with the wide
range of people connected to the OA movement. The OAI series of
workshops is one of the biggest international meetings in this field and
takes place roughly every two years.

http://www.unige.ch/workshop/oai6/

Further information will be added to this web site, including programme
details, a registration form, a call for posters, and accommodation and
travel advice. The 2009 workshop will be held at a larger venue
belonging to the University of Geneva (UniGe) who we welcome as
co-organisers of this event. Future announcements may be made directly
from the UniGe organisers. Some slides of the new venue can be seen
here:
http://www.unige.ch/workshop/oai6/diaporama-mail.php

The committee looks forward to welcoming you to Geneva next year for
another successful event.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Limit number of records return
Message-ID: <D05CA952-AB82-429B-8F9D-0AED86DBC3A7@senylrc.org>

I have been reading through the OAI documentation and I can't find  
where I can limit the number of records return.  I see that I can do  
it by date but in my case I need to do it my the records.

These our my two objectives

1.  I want to grab the first 20 records in a collection
2. I want to be able to define a new starting point like start at  
record 21 and grab the next 20 records.

Below is the URL I am using to retrieve a set of records from a  
collection

http://www.hrvh.org/cgi-bin/oai.exe? 
verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&set=bard

Any ideas if this can be done, or where in the documentation I should  
be look at to accomplish this?

Thanks

Zachary Spalding

Zachary,

In OAI-PMH the harvester does not decide how many records you get back. 
Instead it is the repository that decides how many records to return for a 
ListRecords response (or headers in a ListIdentifiers response).

If you really wanted to, you could do a ListIdentifiers request and then 
do a GetRecord request on each of the first N records.  But it is probably 
easiest to do a ListRecords and only parse the first N records from the 
response.

regards,

Michael
