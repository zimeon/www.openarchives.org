I may actually turn off harvesting xtcat - I forgot it was 4,000,000
records! I think I will run out of disk space trying to harvest it. :-)

In terms of the retry suggestions, our code does remember the last
resumption token of when it failed. Currently we do not retry immediately
(which we could do), but rather since the harvests are scheduled regularly,
we wait until the next harvest time comes along and attempt to resume from
then. So we do (2) but not (1) at present. We don't do (3) because
we find that updating the database takes about the same time as the HTTP
request (ie, its not a significant bottle neck). (This is not always true
- it depends on the site.) It also avoids big temporary files (our
database compresses the records, so the database *plus* full text indexes
is often smaller than the input data.) But if you have a slow database
engine I understand what you are getting at.

The latest request for xtcat returned a HTML page by the way.
In the Apache generated HTML it had the text

    &quot;The requested resource (/xtcat/servlet/OAIHandler) is
    not available.&quot;

A previous day we had DNS lookup error! (alcme.oclc.org).

Is this any criticism of xtcat? No, more that I agree completely that
doing long duration things over HTTP is prone to all sorts of little
unexpected problems.

So I will look at putting (1) on the feature list (immediate retries),
but only for OAI data providers that report that they support idempotent
resumption tokens (which xtcat I assume does).

But I better find some more disk space before I try to complete the
harvest!!!! (I have around 1,100,000 records so far.)
