<PRE>Hi all,

I would like to concur with Eric's statements, and also to solicit
criticisms or comments regarding some sample RDF metadata files we have
created for our DLib project.  (These are all well-formed XML that pass the
SiRPAC RDF parser, but we don't have an XML schema for them yet.)  A sample
is available at
<A HREF="http://dli.grainger.uiuc.edu/publications/05_lecuyer_full.met,">http://dli.grainger.uiuc.edu/publications/05_lecuyer_full.met,</A> and more can
be made available upon request.  Note:  We have taken extensive liberties
with the Dublin Core Qualifiers (DCQ), creating some of our own refinements
and encodings, plus we have utilized a version of the Dublin Core Agents
standard, which we realize may never be officially sanctioned.  This is all
still very experimental on our part, and we are deliberately pushing the
standards as much as we can.

Like Eric we are not that interested in AI, ontologies, and the semantic web
per se, but we are interested in using RDF's model and syntax (not RDF
schema, at least yet) as a _standard_ way to express relations between
metadata (i.e. RDF containers, statements about statements, mixing
namespaces both for use in creating the RDF graphs (parseType=&quot;Resource&quot;)
and also for use as literals (parseType=&quot;Literal&quot; -- see our use of MathML
in the above example).   We also like the ability to extract triples from
the RDF in a standard way, so as to create searchable databases.  (We also
have an experimental search interface that utilizes this.)

I too think that RDF (at least, model and syntax) and OAI would make a nice
match.

Kind regards,
	Tom

</I>&gt;<i> -- the content of databases, have the metadata returned in RDF, and then
</I>&gt;<i> save this data to Redland, RDFStore, or rdfdb as well. OAI strengths seems
</I>&gt;<i> to be the provision of an API for querying remote resources for their
</I>&gt;<i> metadata. RDF's strength lies in describing how that metadata is structured.
</I>&gt;<i> Why not combine them?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More to the point, I believe I am more interested in #1, #3, and #4 above. I

</I>&gt;<i> metadata in RDF for further processing.
