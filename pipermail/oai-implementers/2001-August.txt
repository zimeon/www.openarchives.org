Subject: [OAI-implementers] EPrints 2 Alpha-1
Message-ID: <20010801164418.A31652@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

As announced last month at the London OAI meeting:

August 1st 2001:
EPrints 2 Alpha-1 has been released and is available from:
http://www.eprints.org/files/eprints/

Features Include
 - International language support (UTF-8 and multiple "phrase" files)
 - Much improved database back end - real text indexing and normalised data.
 - Improved installation (no longer uses ./configure & make)
 - Full support for multiple archives on one server
 - Object Oriented Design and database abstraction

Caveats
 - This is not a stable (or even fully working) release.
 - It is not an upgrade for EPrints 1 series.
 - Many bits remain to be done.

If all goes to plan, from tonight, nightly builds from CVS will be available too.

See http://www.eprints.org/ for more information on the eprints project.

Dear all:

We are pleased to announce the availability of the new open archives
initiative web site at http://www.openarchives.org.  This new site is
served from Cornell University - the former site was served from Los
Alamos National Labs Library.  We are grateful for the excellent support
by LANL library since the inception of the OAI.  Because of the
mechanics of DNS, it may take a couple of days for the name resolution
to propagate across the network.  Please be patient if you still are
resolved to the old site.

The new site incorporates a number of improvements:

- easier and more uniform navigaton across OAI information
- shortcuts from the home page to core documents and information
- opportunities for formation and links to OAI communities.  We invite
you to use the "submit a post to our web site" feature available from
the home page so that we can link to OAI related information from your
community.

As always feedback is welcome to openarchives@openarchives.org.

Thanks,

Herbert Van de Sompel

Nava,

In your XML response, it looks like there is one blank line in front of  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

In W3C document, "XML documents should begin with an XML declaration which
specifies the version of XML being used", probably the blank line confuses
parser.

I use XMLSpy to read your xml response, and remove the blank line, it
passes well-formed inspection and doesn't show "XML parsing error" again.


Hope it helps,
Xiaoming Liu

its a very common pitfall ... your XML is in UTF-8 but you have a
Latin-1 entity in your author field ...

  <author>Issa Paola V&aacute;zquez Guti&eacute;rrez</author>

for maximum portability, it is recommended that you convert the Latin-1
entities to Unicode (if you use Perl, as part of my Perl OAI-DP
implementation available from the OAI website there is a Utility.pm
module that addresses lots of XML issues, including this conversion)

ultimately you want to get something like:
  <author>Issa Paola V&#x00E1;zquez Guti&#x00E9;rrez</author>

a cheap alternative is to escape all ampersands to pass the Latin-1
entities unconverted ... but thats cheating :)

There is a slightly more elegant solution that you can use to encode the
multi-byte unicode characters.  I'll paste an excerpt from Bert
Degenhart Drenth's paper "Report on the CIMI XML Dublin Core DTD."

---

UTF-8 encoding (RFC2044)
In UTF-8 encoding wide characters, such as 16 bit Unicode are coded as
multiple single bytes. The most significant bit of the characters is
playing an important role in the encoding in the following way:
 
1.		ASCII characters in the range of 0 – 127 remain
unchanged.
2.		Characters with values higher than 127 start with a
character that has a number of bits on the left side set to one,
followed by a single 0 bit. The number of bits that are set to 1
determine the total number of bytes in the character e.g. 110 means two
bytes, 1110 means three bytes etc.
3.		All continuation bytes have their left two bits set to
‘10’
4.		The remaining unused bits contain the bits of the
character, written from left to right.
 
An example:
 
Byte 1		Byte 2
110 00011	10111100    decodes as     000 1111 1100  (Hexadecimal
FC or ü)
(byte one starts with 110, meaning a total of two bytes, byte 2 has the
left two bits set to 10 meaning that it is a continuation bit, the rest
contains the ü)

---

Since you use Java (I notice the .jsp extension on your repository), you
don't even have to worry about this.  When the OutputStreamWriter for
your response is created, you can tell it which encoding to use.  For
example:

PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter ( new OutputStreamWriter ( 
	response.getOutputStream (), "UTF8" ) );

Caveat Emptor:  This approach may eat up your CPU time.  To get around
it with the repository that I wrote, I stored the DC records as Unicode
byte-strings in a BLOB in my database.  To correctly write it back out,
I used a PrintStream with OutputStream.write (byte[], int, int) instead
of a PrintWriter.

I wish you the best of luck with your thesis!

Kind regards,
Henry Stern

(if this message appears 3 times, sorry, I kept sending
it from the wrong account)

Argh. I've been working on a minor upgrade to eprints 1.1
to bring it "up to code" with regards to OAI1.1 and I just
discovered that the SetSpec only allows a-zA-Z0-9 and : as
a seperator.
    
Our standard default sets use '-' all over the place.

I'm looking at encoding the setspecs as hex strings 0-9A-F
so "A" is encoded as "41" etc. This way I can even use UTF-8
which means I can do some very interesting things...

This _will_ mean that people running eprints will have all
their OAI setspec's change. But seeing as their current ones
are illegal, that's not a big problem.

A bigger problem is that where we currently have bio:bio-ani-behav

we now have:
62696F:62696F2D616E692D6265686176
which is less human-readable. Does that really matter as it's just
a key?

Comments please!

I see no reason why users should ever see the setSpec, they
should see the setName instead. Following that logic I
don't see that strangely encoded setSpecs should matter.

However, your suggestion is slightly unwieldy. If such schemes
are adopted and setSpecs get large then we might want to
consider adding recommendations on the maximum lengths of these
things to the protocol spec.

Cheers,
Simeon.

I was planning to make the eprints code able to use any
field for OAI sets, not just "subjects" like it does now.

The intention being able to export, for example, each author
as a set.

If you do set a maximum length, I'd hope it was pretty large,
like over a "k", I'm not saying it needs to be, but arbitary
restrictions make me edgy. 

Something like 4096bytes (Is that the legal max for a URL?) 
would be more than enough. But I reckon more than enough is
better than just enough. It is quite possible to imagine 
someone using the MD5 of something as the set tags (or 
whatever) and once you got 5 deep it would start to get 
really long.

OK , I'm being over paranoid, but I was brought up with
people quoting the old "640k should be enough for anybody"
story at me.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Re: SetSpec RegExp
Message-ID: <0C2C50C9B668D311878100A0C9EA3676BAFC23@dungeon.library.caltech.edu>

How about generating the key based on the output of:

$ date +%s

(number of seconds since Jan. 1, 1970)?

And if the key needs to be globally unique, you could prefix the
repositoryID. This would keep the size manageable, keep the key completely
isolated from the user and ensure it's uniqueness.

Thus a hierarchy for the repository 'caltechASCI' may look like this:

SetName					SetKey

Engineering					caltechASCI:999103748
Engineering:Aeronautics			caltechASCI:999103748:999103786
Enginnering:Applied Mathematics	caltechASCI:999103748:999103840
Physical Sciences & Mathematics	caltechASCI:999103868
