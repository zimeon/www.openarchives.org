Subject: [OAI-implementers] DSpace OAI-PMH support changes, issues
Message-ID: <40700B4C02ABD5119F00009027876644084DF66C@hplex1.hpl.hp.com>

[Resending, as this seemed to bounce...]

Hi all,

As part of DSpace 1.2, I've made a few changes and fixes to the OAI-PMH support in DSpace.  In particular, communities can now be organised into an hierarchy which may change over time.  Hence the set structure exposed by DSpace is now just collections, where the set spec is the CNRI handle of the set.

This (and other changes) have a variety of consequences on the OAI-PMH side:

- In existing DSpaces, the sets of existing items will change after the code update.  There are previously-discussed issues with this.  The "'delete' every record and re-issue with new ID" approach won't really work for us, since the IDs of records are the item Handles.

- The upgrade also involves minor changes to each item (apart from the set spec), which means that after an upgrade, every record will be modified and presumably be re-harvested.

In view of the above, I'm wondering whether it might be a good time to introduce a couple of other changes:

- Are Handles appropriate IDs for the OAI metadata records?  Originally, it seemed pointless to me to use anything else; forcing people to jump through yet another hoop to get yet another unique ID to get set up.  However, on occasion people have indicated they'd rather use an oai: prefixed identifier.  If anyone can offer reasons and suggestions either way I'd appreciate it.

- Might it be a good idea to change the base URL from something like http://dspace.mit.edu/oai/ to something like http://dspace.mit.edu/oai/request?  Having that / on the end has confused a few people, as URLs like this look a little awkward:

http://dspace.mit.edu/oai/?verb=Identify

Additionally, not having a / at the end also would allow the OAI implementation to use XSLTs to render the responses for browsers.

However, of course this would of course require DSpace instances to re-register with openarchives.org, which isn't exactly ideal, but since there are other changes happening at the same time, perhaps now's a good time to just take the hit and clean things up a bit.

Thoughts?

            _Web Feeds from OAI Data/Service Providers_

I am greatly interested in learning of Any and All OAI Service
Providers _or_ OAI Data Providers
that offer Web feeds (RSS, Atom, Other(s)) for site updates/search
results/etc.

BTW: I am aware of the RSS feeds are provided by my.OAI [
http://www.myoai.com/ ],
one of the  major Open Archives Initiative Service Providers
[ http://www.public.iastate.edu/~gerrymck/OAI-SP-I.pdf ]

Thanks!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0406151507160.30168@dhcp103-124.cs.cornell.edu>


I've been collecting problems/corrections to the OAI-PMH protocol document
and schema for some time. I detail proposed corrections and fixes below.
Please reply either directly to me or to the list with comments or
additional issues/corrections/errors.

Cheers,

PROPOSED FIXES TO OAI PROTOCOL DOCUMENT AND SCHEMA
--------------------------------------------------

1) Correct protocol document and schema definition of setSpec to be
consistent, and also to permit the use of URL encoding.

1.1) Motivation

First, the protocol document and the schema simply do not agree. The use
of the wording "any characters that are safe in a query component of a
URI" is unclear and cannot be construed to agree with the schema. Second,
many repositories are using URL-like encoding to create setSpecs so it
seems better to permit the recognized URL encoding. The practical change
to meet both of these criteria is very small: the schema regular
expression should be changed to remove $ and +, and to add ~ and %xx (URL
encoding). This will bring the protocol document in line with the terms
"escaped" and "unreserved" as used in the URI RFC.

1.2) Impact

The only conforming repository that we know of using setSpecs affected by
this change is Jeff Young's OpenURL repository
(http://alcme.oclc.org/openurl/servlet/OAIHandler) where he uses '+' as
an encoding for space. Jeff agrees that a change would be sensible and
that he could be replace '+' with '%20'. Repositories using URL-like
encodings will not be affected although they may choose to change to use
real URL encoding. All OAI software maintainers should, however, review
the change and update their parsing code accordingly.

1.3) Changes

1.3.1) Change wording in protocol document
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#Set
from:

a setSpec -- a colon [:] separated list indicating the path from the root
of the set hierarchy to the respective node.  Each element in the list is
a string consisting of any characters that are safe in a query component
of a URI , which must not contain any colons [ :].  Since a setSpec forms
a unique identifier for the set within the repository, it must be unique
for each set.  Flat set organizations have only sets with setSpec that do
not contain any colons [ :].

to:

a setSpec -- a colon [:] separated list indicating the path from the root
of the set hierarchy to the respective node. Each element in the list is a
string consisting of any valid URI "unreserved" and "escaped" characters.
A setTag must not contain URI "reserved" characters, for example the colon
[:] which is used to delimit setTags. Since a setSpec forms a unique
identifier for the set within the repository, it must be unique for each
set. Flat set organizations have only sets with setSpec that do not
contain any colons [:].

The corresponding parts of the specification of allowed characters in URIs
are:

unreserved    = alphanum | mark
mark          = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" |
                "(" | ")"
escaped       = "%" hex hex
hex           = digit | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" |
                "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"


1.3.2) Change definition of setSpecType in the schema to match the definition
from:

 <simpleType name="setSpecType">
    <restriction base="string">
      <pattern value=
       "([A-Za-z0-9_!'$\(\)\+\-\.\*])+(:[A-Za-z0-9_!'$\(\)\+\-\.\*]+)*"/>
    </restriction>
  </simpleType>

to:

  <simpleType name="setSpecType">
    <restriction base="string">
      <pattern value="([A-Za-z0-9\-_\.!~\*'\(\)]|(%[A-Fa-f0-9]{2}))+(:([A-Za-z0-9\-_\.!~\*'\(\)]|(%[A-Fa-f0-9]{2}))+)*"/>
    </restriction>
  </simpleType>


2) Correct protocol document and schema definition for metadataPrefix to
be consistent, and also to match the revised setSpec definition.

2.1) Motivation

The protocol document uses the same imprecise wording for metadataPrefix
as it does for setSpec ("any characters that are safe in a query
component of a URI") and the schema does not even follow a reasonable
interpretation of this wording. It seems sensible to use the same
character restrictions in a consistent fashion. This will bring the
protocol document in line with the terms "escaped" and "unreserved" as
used in the URI RFC.

2.2) Impact

This change is not expected to impact any known repository.  All OAI
software maintainers should, however, review the change and update their
parsing code accordingly.

2.3) Changes

2.2.1) Change wording in protocol document
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#metadataPrefix
from:

The metadataPrefix - a string to specify the metadata format in OAI-PMH
requests issued to the repository. metadataPrefix consists of any
characters that are safe in a query component of a URI. metadataPrefix
arguments are used in ListRecords, ListIdentifiers, and GetRecord
requests to retrieve records, or the headers of records that include
metadata in the format specified by the metadataPrefix;

to:

The metadataPrefix - a string to specify the metadata format in OAI-PMH
requests issued to the repository. metadataPrefix consists of any valid
URI "unreserved" and "escaped"  characters. A metadataPrefix must not
contain URI "reserved" characters. metadataPrefix arguments are used in
ListRecords, ListIdentifiers, and GetRecord requests to retrieve records,
or the headers of records that include metadata in the format specified
by the metadataPrefix;

2.3.2) Change definition of metadataPrefixType in schema to match the
definition from:

  <simpleType name="metadataPrefixType">
    <restriction base="string">
      <pattern value="[A-Za-z0-9_!'$\(\)\+\-\.\*]+"/>
    </restriction>
  </simpleType>

to:

  <simpleType name="metadataPrefixType">
    <restriction base="string">
      <pattern value="([A-Za-z0-9\-_\.!~\*'\(\)]|(%[A-Fa-f0-9]{2}))+"/>
    </restriction>
  </simpleType>


3) Change protocol document to explicitly state the sets may be empty

3.1) Motivation

This issue has been raised a number of times in discussion and is not
made explicit in the protocol document.

3.2) Impact

None (except clarity)

3.3) Change: add additional bullet to the final set of bullets in protocol
document sec2.6
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#Set

Introduction of bullets should say "Five issues should be noted here"
instead of "Four issues should be noted here".

Additional bullet: The set hierarchy of a repository may include sets
that are empty.


4) Correct typo on sec2.6
(http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#Set)

Section 2.6 says:

If a repository supports sets then it must include set membership
information in the GetRecord request. The list of setSpec should include
only the minimum number of setSpec required to specify the set
membership. Using the previous example of a set hierarchy, the header for
an item organized in set institution:florida should not include setSpec
institution since that is implied by the setSpec institution:florida .

when it should say 'in response to ListIdentifiers, ListRecords and
GetRecord requests' instead of 'in the GetRecord request'. The corrected
paragraph reads:

If a repository supports sets then it must include set membership
information in the headers returned in response to ListIdentifiers,
ListRecords and GetRecord requests. The list of setSpec elements should
include only the minimum number of setSpec elements required to specify
the set membership. Using the previous example of a set hierarchy, the
header for an item organized in set institution:florida should not
include setSpec institution since that is implied by the setSpec
institution:florida.

[problem pointed out by Mike Taylor <mike@indexdata.com>]


5) Correct typo the second example in protocol document sec5
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#dublincore

The namespace is incorrectly given in the declaration. It is 'oai' and
not 'oai_dc' and the example is not schema valid. The following
correction is required:

3c3
<     xmlns:oai="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/"
---
>     xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/"

[problem pointed out by Terry Harrison <1maniac@cox.net>]


6) Schema should more tightly validate UTCdatetime

6.1) Motivation

While the specification is quite clear about what datetime formats must
be used, the fact that the schema does not enforce the restriction to Z
notation means that there are errors not found during schema validation.
The additional check is easy to add to the schema and would likely
improve interoperability.

6.2) Impact

No conforming repository should be affected. The responses from some
non-conforming implementations will no longer schema validate. It is
hoped that this will encourage maintainers to correct them.

6.3) Change schema definition from:

  <simpleType name="UTCdatetimeType">
    <union memberTypes="date dateTime"/>
  </simpleType>

to:

  <simpleType name="UTCdatetimeType">
    <union memberTypes="date oai:UTCdateTimeZType"/>
  </simpleType>

  <simpleType name="UTCdateTimeZType">
    <restriction base="dateTime">
      <pattern value=".*Z"/>
    </restriction>
  </simpleType>


7) Add section on deleted records to the protocol document

7.1) Motivation

Deleted records are an issue that causes confusion. This is not helped by
information about them being distributed over the protocol document.

7.2) Impact

none (except greater comprehension!)

7.3) Change protocol document to include:

2.5.1 Deleted records

If a record is no longer available then it is said to be 'deleted'.
Repositories may or may not keep track of deletions. If a repository does
not keep track of deletions then such records will simply vanish from
responses and there will be no way for a harvester to discover deletions
through continued incremental harvesting. If a repository does keep track
of deletions then the datestamp of the deleted record _must_ be the date
and time that it was deleted. Responses to a GetRecord request for a
deleted record _must_ then include a header with the attribute
status="deleted" and no metadata or about parts. Similarly, responses to
selective harvesting requests with set membership and date range criteria
that include deleted records _must_ include the headers of these records.
Incremental harvesting will thus discover deletions from repositories
that keep track of them. Repositories must indicate their level of
support for deletions in the deletedRecord element of the Identify
response.

Note that deleted status is a property of individual records. Like a
normal record, a deleted record is identified by a unique identifier, a
metadataPrefix and a datestamp. Other records, with different
metadataPrefix but the same unique identifier, may remain available for
the an item.


8) Change schema to defined a type for protocolVersion instead of using
an anonymous definition (ALREADY DONE, 2004-03-29)

8.1) Motivation

To allow reuse as part of the Static Repository schema
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/OAI-PMH-static-repository.xsd

8.2) Impact

None except as noted in motivation. Schema semantics unchanged; all
validating instances will still validate.

8.3) Change to OAI-PMH.xsd

98,104c100
<       <element name="protocolVersion">
<         <simpleType>
<           <restriction base="string">

The UIUC Registry of OAI data providers 
(http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/) has an RSS feed of new or 
recently modified registry records at 
http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/rss.asp

You might also be interested in the SRU search service for the same 
registry at http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/sru/sru.asp

In addition Jeff Young has an interesting service called ERRoL 
(Extensible Repository Resource Locators) which works in conjunction 
with the UIUC Registry to turn any OAI provider with a unique 
identifier into an RSS feed (among other things).  Take a look at 
http://errol.oclc.org/ or for a specific example using the LOC OAI 
provider http://errol.oclc.org/lcoa1.loc.gov.rss

Aside from the possibility of changing ids to get around the changing sets
problem, I can't see why an oai-identifier would be preferred to a handle.

One potential scenario I've thought of is where >1 DSpace contains the same item, with the same Handle (resource ID).  Each DSpace might have different/additional metadata though and in any case probably shouldn't use the same ID for OAI-PMH.  So, perhaps an easy way forward is to use an OAI identifier of the form:

oai:(dspace hostname):(handle)

E.g.

oai:dspace.mit.edu:1721.1/1234

Message-ID: <40700B4C02ABD5119F00009027876644084DF693@hplex1.hpl.hp.com>

So, is there any agreed process for the lifecycle of OAI data providers?  If we make the change below in DSpace (Handles -> OAI scheme identifiers) there seem to be two basic choices:

1/ 'Delete' all the metadata records with Handles so that harvesters know that records have been deleted.  This would be a pain to implement as it'd need to keep a record.

2/ Change the base URL, so effectively a DSpace would become a 'new' OAI-PMH data provider (the old URL would just stop working)

I'd be hesitant to do 2, since that would mean for a lot of harvesters DSpace at MIT and a whole bunch of other places would seem to just 'disappear'.  Openarchives.org doesn't seem to offer any way of changing or removing an entry, and in any case, do service providers actually regularly pay attention to this?

I'm guessing that unless the relevant people are paying attention to this list, most providers wouldn't see the change, and even then they'd only catch the MIT change, other sites running DSpace would have to announce when theirs changed.

Do any others have experience of doing something like this?

Dear OAI-implementers,

Looking at the OAI-PMH examples in XML at:
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#dublincore
example number 2,  line  10

<dc:subject>LCSH:Ausdehnungslehre; LCCN QA205.H99</dc:subject>

has the schemes LCSH LCCN embedded in the xml.

I had thought that schemes because they are 'qualifiers' are not 
OAI-PMH compliant.
If i want to specify schemes in a metadata set that will be OAI-PMH 
compliant how would i do this? My metadata set will consist of a 
number of elements from the 15 UDC metadata elements set. Other 
schemes i wish to specify, besides LCSH for DC.subject, would be 
W3CDTF for DC.date, RFC3066 for DC.language, URI  for DC.identifier 
for example

thanks in advance

that is more like "tunneling" the LCSH headings; not exactly qualifiers.
see example 2.3.9.2 in:

http://www.dublincore.org/documents/2002/05/15/dcq-rdf-xml/

and also:

hi Simeon

[this is a quick reply, cos i am about to leave town but thought i 
should reply now rather than in 2 weeks :)]

firstly, thanks for looking into this. may i suggest that the naming 
system for any updated documentation be looked at very carefully so as 
not to cause any confusion among readers. i would be in favour of an 
"OAI-PMH revision 2" with a link back to the first revision. anyone have 
better ideas?

1/2: i have some reservations about us requiring URL-encoding within 
XML. this mixes syntax with intended semantics of use and further 
entrenches the implicit support for URL-encoding, which is irrelevant 
if, for example, OAI-PMH makes the jump to using a SOAP request/response 
model. the model and abstractions must be clean and separable, they 
arent quite so already and i would prefer they didnt get more complicated.

3/4/5: sounds good.

6: its about time (no pun intended), but shouldnt the pattern be tighter 
than anything ending in "Z"? or does it not matter for validation 
purposes if the base is set properly? has anyone tried base/extension 
validation?

7: obviously this only applies to "persistent" records. the situation is 
different if "transient" or "no" are specified in the "deletedRecords" 
field of Identify ... so maybe you want to tie this into the discussion 
in section 2.7.1. or merge the sections somehow so it is all clearer.

8: in an attempt not to "grease the squeaky wheel", if ure creating a 
data type for one field, why not for all? wouldnt that be a cleaner 
solution anyway?

ttfn,
----hussein

Each DSpace might have different/additional metadata though and in any case probably shouldn't use the same ID for OAI-PMH.  So, perhaps an easy way forward is to use an OAI identifier of the form:

Rob,

I think the above makes _a lot_ of sense.  As a matter of fact, if I am not 
mistaken, the American Physical Society does something along the same lines by 
making their doi's part of an oai-identifier.

One firm advantage to the above that I can see is the clear distinction that is 
made between the identifier of the resource (handle) and the identifier of the 
OAI-PMH item (oai-identifier) that gives access to metadata about the resource. 
  The more elaborate services that we will start building based on materials in 
Institutional Repositories, the more it will become important to clearly 
distinguish between the identifier of a resource, the identifier of metadata 
that describes the resource, the identifier used in the OAI-PMH to harvest 
metadata pertaining to the resource.  At least we should be aware of those 
differences.  Indicating that distinction through an appropriate choice of 
identifiers doesn't hurt the least.

Generally speaking, I would like to take advantage of this thread to emphasize 
the importance of doing the right thing re identifiers used in the OAI-PMH. 
Recently, at conferences and meetings, I have seen a lot of really problematic 
implementations of OAI-PMH identifiers, including OAI-PMH identifiers that:
* do not follow URI syntax
* do not aim for some global uniqueness
Such a sloppy use of OAI-PMH identifiers is going to eventually cause huge 
problems, for example, when trying to build services on top of a global network 
of Institutional Repositories.  I recommend re-reading what the protocol 
document says re OAI-PMH identifiers: 
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#UniqueIdentifier

More specifically, we use a DOI suffix for our journal articles that is 
transparently
related to the typical (journal, volume, page/article id) citation 
triplet for our
articles. As Herbert points out, we use the DOI suffix as the oai 
identifier as well
for our (mode 0) OAI services. In general, we find it best to have a 
single way
to cite or otherwise reference our journal article, to the point where 
we have
eliminated page numbers and replaced it with a 6 digit article id that 
allows
us to post articles one at a time online in advance of print and still 
have
the print TOC ordered monotonically with the articles sort by subject 
area.
Most (almost all) other publishers have DOI's that aren't directly 
related
to the article's final citation (only decided when the print issue is 
paginated)
and, thus, have opaque DOI suffixes...

One could I suppose use the full DOI (with the prefix included), but I
find DOI prefixes not very illuminated (10.1103 is ours) and would
rather have something better like oai:aps.org.

Cheers,
Mark

Does anyone know of any live examples of OAI providers that serve records
in the Visual Resources Association Core Categories (VRA)?  I've done some
browsing through the OAI registries at UIUC and openarchives.org but
turned up nothing so far.

Will --

It looks like the American Numismatic Society is using VRA Core. I took a 
look at the distinct metadata schemas report on the UIUC registry 
(http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/ListSchemas.asp) and then did a 
search for vra.

The details for the American Numismatic Society are here: 
http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/details.asp?id=469

It also looks like there's a test archive here: 
http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/details.asp?id=204

Thanks for the replies about the UIUC registry listing -- my synapses
failed to register the "Distinct Metadata Schemas" link on the page there,
this Monday morning :)

FWIW, the American Numismatic Society's vra output seems to have a rogue
"</dc>"  tag in it that prevents the xml from validating.

I've turned up a certain amount of discussion among visual resources
curators and the cultural heritage community about the use of OAI for VRA
metadata, but the practice doesn't seem to have caught on.  I'm just
curious now, but this question comes to mind.  Are there any communities,
which have their own metadata standards aside from Dublin Core, into which
OAI has diffused broadly?  Eprints and ETD's seem to have adopted OAI,
with the use of Dublin Core.  But are there any specialties with
established metadata practices and their own, non-DC, standards where OAI
has significantly caught on?

Please feel free to correct gently any mistaken assumptions of mine, in
asking this question.

Will

Hi Will,

You've touched on an issue that is coming up in various forums....

I think that your assumptions are correct - Dublin Core and variations of 
Dublin Core are the most used schemas. MARC is used a fair amount as well, 
though I don't know of many service providers that are making use of the 
MARC records (please correct me if I'm wrong). OLAC (the Open Language 
Archive Community) has adapted Dublin Core (beyond the dcterms list) to 
meet their particular needs (see 
http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/metadata.html#The%20metadata%20set 
for more information). Also, there are probably closed systems where 
schemas other than Dublin Core are being used.

There have been more conversations among service providers - particularly 
those within the Digital Library Federation - recently about the need to 
actively encourage the use of metadata schemas in addition to Dublin Core. 
Dublin Core is useful in so far that it provides a -somewhat- common 
denominator, but we at Illinois and other service providers have found that 
DC use is so variant that it takes significant resources to normalize it 
and massage it into a useful form. If data providers would provide their 
native metadata schema as well as DC (to be conformant) we could 
potentially make better use of it. Even qualified DC provides more useful 
semantics than simple DC.

 Hi!
FYI, it the National Library of Portugal we have used OAI with UNIMARC in
several internal and european projects.
The experience had shown us the obvious: if we want to expose records for
simple resource discovery services, DC works fine, but if you want to share
the records for more complex purposes (browsing services, re-usage for
cataloguing - such as we are doing in our national project for thesis and
dissertations, were we are using a national schema, etc.) you'll need to use
other richer formats. Another exanple is if the European project LEAF, where
several partners are exposing EAC records (Encoding Archival Context) by OAI
for a commom central service.

jos? borbinha
