Well, Kat, there is yet another one, called MERESCO.

It has been developed in the Netherlands by SURF-foundation, SURF-net,
KennisNet and CQ2. It actually is a larger library of components for
metadata management (including data normalization, integrated and
facetted search etc), but one of the earliest set of components
contains a complete OAI harvester with Web UI.

For general information see http://meresco.com

For the harvester in particular see
http://meresco.com/page/package_information?package=meresco-harvester

It is all Open Source and actively developed.  SURF-foundation
organizes a conference on MERESCO September 29th 2009.


Best regards,
Erik

Hi All,

Since this thread still seems alive, let me post some of the OAI 
software we've developed.

There's pyoai, which provides a client and server implementation in 
python. It's been developed in 2003 and quite mature.

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyoai/

A simple oai client can be written as follows:

=========

from oaipmh.client import Client
from oaipmh.metadata import MetadataRegistry
from lxml import etree

URL = 'http://<some oai feed>'

registry = MetadataRegistry()

class Reader(object):
     def __call__(self, element):
         return etree.tostring(element, pretty_print=True, encoding='UTF8')

registry.registerReader('oai_dc', Reader())

client = Client(URL, registry)

for count, record in enumerate(client.listRecords(metadataPrefix='oai_dc')):
     header = record[0]
     metadata = record[1] or ''
     print '%4d: harvested %s, %s bytes' % (count,
                                            header.identifier(),
                                            len(metadata))

====

There's also MOAI, which is a server platform that also can harvest oai 
data. It's also based on pyoai, but overkill if you're just looking for 
a simple client.

Kind Regards,
Jasper

I'd also like to mention the PKP Metadata Harvester(http://pkp.sfu.ca/harvester),  which provides a extensible, LAMP aggregator/search application against OAI-PMH data providers (inc. static repositories) emitting DC, MODS, MARCXML, and ETDMS.
