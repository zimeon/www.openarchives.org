PS to the folks at arc:  I notice that you harvested the records from our
unadvertised test server.  You may want to pull them again from the
production server.  We have made some minor adjustments to the MARC to DC
mapping and the Dublin Core records will be &quot;better&quot; than those you have.

Architecture and Interior Design for 20th Century America: Photographs by
Samuel Gottscho and William Schleisner, 1935-1955
 
     Description: The Gottscho-Schleisner Collection is comprised of over
29,000 images primarily of architectural subjects, including interiors and
exteriors of homes, stores, offices, factories, historic buildings, and
other structures. Subjects are concentrated chiefly in the northeastern
United States, especially the New York City area, and Florida. Included
are the homes of notable Americans, such as Raymond Loewy, and of several
U.S. presidents, as well as color images of the 1939-40 New York World's
Fair. Many of the photographs were commissioned by architects, designers,
owners and architectural publications, and document important achievements
in American 20th-century architecture and interior design.

Washington as It Was: Photographs by Theodor Horydczak, 1923-1959

the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, including exteriors and interiors of
commercial, residential, and government buildings, as well as street
scenes and views of neighborhoods.  A number of Washington events and
activities, such as the 1932 Bonus Army encampment, the 1933 World Series,
and World War II preparedness campaigns, are also depicted.
