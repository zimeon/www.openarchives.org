<PRE>Dear Stuart,

I was there in the Dec. 3-4 NSDL PIs meeting and may be able to add a
little more to what Carl has already stated. After talking to Diane Hillman
and browsing information on the NSDL website, this is my understanding.

&quot;The NSDL Standards Working Group has determined that the Dublin Core set
of 15 qualified elements, plus the elements recommended by the DC Education
Working Group, will be the standard set used by the NSDL metadata
repository.
(Ref:
<A HREF="http://siteforscience.nsdl.cornell.edu/metadata_info/overview.html#NSDL">http://siteforscience.nsdl.cornell.edu/metadata_info/overview.html#NSDL</A> ).

Besides DC-Ed, they have also identified other formats NSDL plans to
support. You can get information about these from the Web sites:

<A HREF="http://siteforscience.nsdl.cornell.edu/metadata_info/outline.html">http://siteforscience.nsdl.cornell.edu/metadata_info/outline.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.smete.org/nsdl/workgroups/standards/standards_home.html">http://www.smete.org/nsdl/workgroups/standards/standards_home.html</A>
<A HREF="http://128.253.121.110/NSDLmetaWG/IntroPage.html">http://128.253.121.110/NSDLmetaWG/IntroPage.html</A>

These metadata formats can  be supported as parallel metadata formats in
OAI. Regarding Mac OS X, I recently bought a Powerbook G4 with OS X and
there is full Java support on it and it comes with Apache web server. I
have not yet tried the Tomcat servlet engine on it - there is one available
for it. In summary,  you should be able to host an  OAI compliant
collection using some of the Java based tools available on the tool site
pointed out by Carl. In fact you should be able to use even Perl tools (OS
X is based on BSD Unix).

Stuart,

Thanks for your question.  I've taken the liberty to add the members of
NSDL collections to this response.

Regarding your first question: The OAI already defines an xml schema for
its one required metadata format - dublin core.  This is explained at
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI_protocol/openarchivesprotocol.html#dubli">http://www.openarchives.org/OAI_protocol/openarchivesprotocol.html#dubli</A>
ncore and the actual schema is at
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/1.1/dc.xsd.">http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/1.1/dc.xsd.</A>  As for the other metadata
formats that NSDL participants will share, there are as far as I know no
established schema as of yet.  Perhaps Diane Hillmann can chip in here
and share whether this is true.  If there are indeed no schemas as of
yet, we should certainly settle on these in the near future.

Regarding your second question:  This is the right list for discussion
of hardward and software for acting as an OAI data provider.  At this
point I don't know of anyone who is using Mac OS X for this but that
doesn't mean that there isn't someone else who isn't doing that. There
is a growing list of tools at
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html">http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html</A> and I believe that the
DLESE folks are working on a java based implementation that should run
with little problem on OS X.

Carl

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to thank all of you that were at the meeting talking
</I>&gt;<i> about harvesting and OAI.  Being a novice at this I
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate how well
</I>&gt;<i> the area of OAI was described and I now have a much better
</I>&gt;<i> perspective on
</I>&gt;<i> its use and implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question, I hope, is simple. From reading
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI_protocol/openarchivesprotocol.html">http://www.openarchives.org/OAI_protocol/openarchivesprotocol.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I get that I need to generate a few files that describe the different
</I>&gt;<i> schema for supplying metadata via OAI.  I also see the
</I>&gt;<i> formatted XML that
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be returned to the requester.  My question is - is
</I>&gt;<i> there yet an
</I>&gt;<i> NSDL format for the data returned via XML, and what are the
</I>&gt;<i> minimum number
</I>&gt;<i> of schema files I need to generate so that I can support NSDL
</I>&gt;<i> harvesting
</I>&gt;<i> via OAI?  If they do exist where are they and is there a help
</I>&gt;<i> file that
</I>&gt;<i> goes with them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any help greatly appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a separate topic - is there a list like this for discussion of the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware and software being used to serve the collection data?  As
</I>&gt;<i> webmaster of the &quot;Analytical Sciences Digital Library&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> project I want to
</I>&gt;<i> use Mac OS X, Webstar V, Lasso Pro 5, and Filemaker Pro 5.5 all on the
</I>&gt;<i> same Mac.  I am convinced that this will be both powerful enough and
</I>&gt;<i> scalable enough my co-PIs are worried I will run into trouble
</I>&gt;<i> using this
</I>&gt;<i> for production.  Any places to go greatly appreciated also.
