Hi,

go to http://www.openarchives.org/data/registerasprovider.html
there you find information about registering your repository as a data 
provide. At the end of the page there is a form "Registering Your 
OAI-PMH 2.0 Repository". You got two options
a) validation
b) registration

hope this helps

Claudia

Hi,

I sent off some info for the OAI Tools page a couple of weeks ago, just 
wondering what the process is now since the entry has not yet been added 
- does it need to be reviewed, etc, before it appears on the site (I 
also sent a mail to the openarchives@openarchives.org list but have 
heard nothing back)?

In case it's fallen off the list, descriptive text for OAI Tools site as 
follows:

Tool: Harvester Service 
(http://www.apsr.edu.au/software.htm#harvester_package)
Implementer: The Australian National University (http://www.anu.edu.au)
Description:The Harvester Service is an open source OAI-PMH harvesting 
application based on OCLC's OAIHarvester2. It is a deployable webapp 
running under Tomcat providing harvest scheduling and management 
services for use by external applications. It also supports deployment 
of custom harvest classes for tailored processing on request and 
response data.

Hi all -

Due to the help and support received from folks on this list, our data
provider has been up and running for several months with just one hiccup in
service. So, first: thanks!

Now I have a question about deleted records.  We started up our service
without any support for deleted records
(<deletedRecord>no</deletedRecord>).  However, I'm realizing that this was
short-sighted and now want to support deletions. But I'm a little confused
as to how to proceed.

We are an archive of research listings. People who contribute to our archive
get a free account and log into that to add and subsequently maintain their
listings. They do have the ability to make a listing "unavailable". As well,
if there's a problem with a listing we can "unapprove" it. Either of these
actions takes the listing off-line.  When either action occurs, I plan to
update our data provider and swap out the record in question with a record
signifying a deletion which is essentially what either of these actions
translates into.

I understand that my choices are persistent
<deletedRecord>persistent</deletedRecord>, or transient
<deletedRecord>transient</deletedRecord>. I'd like to go with persistent,
but does that mean that I have to maintain a record of every single time
someone makes their record unavailable and then makes it available again in
our database (this doesnt' happen a ton, but does happen often enough to be
a concern)?  Also I'm not finding anything online letting me know what data
is needed to show all of these records deletions -- how would I get that
info to any of our harvesters?

I just switched us from "no" to "transient" which seems a little less, well,
daunting. So we start deletions tonight. But would like some clarification
re: exactly what the technical requirements are to share our data through
persistent data provider.

Any insight, ideas, help -- much appreciated!
~Lisa

Hi,
1) I have create a database who collect metadata from my different repositories
(see : http://www.crhst.cnrs.fr/spip.php?rubrique6). This DB is under MySQL.
2) This DB push in my OAI repository metadata after a little validation by my
team.
3) I create my OAI repo. with phpoai2 create by H. Stamerjohanns (see :
http://physnet.uni-oldenburg.de/oai/). It's run with MySQL or PostgreSQL and
it's easy to merge this tool with a LAMP system.

Lisa,

My understanding (someone correct me if this is wrong) is that if a  
record is deleted then made available again it can retain the same  
identifier.  There may be no evidence that the record was ever  
deleted.  The key here is to update the timestamp each time the record  
status changes.

When I read the spec, my interpretation of "full history of deletions"  
for persistent is that you must always show a deleted record for  
anything that was ever deleted in your repository.  I do not think you  
have to provide a history of each time a record was deleted.  This is  
in contrast with "transient" in that a deleted record can just go away  
any time the data provider wants to get rid of it.
