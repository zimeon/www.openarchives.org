</I>
&gt;<i> I should clarify - I wasn't saying that SOAP should or must be the *only*

</I>&gt;<i> REST has many benefits. A lot of services are  provided with SOAP and REST

&gt;<i> And it wouldn't be so difficult to provide a gateway that could support the

</I>&gt;<i> all their stuff.
</I>
Calling the current approach 'legacy' already worries me; XML over HTTP 
is not legacy just yet. Why not provide a SOAP gateway instead if you 
want to support such legacy SOAP interfaces? :)

&gt;<i> But SOAP does have significant traction (again, I would point to
</I>&gt;<i> www.sforce.com as just one example: and note that Salesforce.com is a
</I>&gt;<i> company that *seriously* know what it is doing technically).
</I>
I'd say REST has a fair amount of traction as well. The &quot;Architecture of 
the World Wide Web, First Edition&quot; document references and describes it:

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/</A>

And xml.com this week is full of articles about REST:

<A HREF="http://www.xml.com/">http://www.xml.com/</A>

&gt;<i> And SOAP takes care of all kinds of housekeeping issues that everyone has to
</I>&gt;<i> roll their own version of, when implementing an OAI-PMH client using raw
</I>&gt;<i> http and XML processing.
</I>
That's the difficulty with frameworks and tools; they offer power but 
also a risk of complexity, which is hard to hide completely. I think 
most of the housekeeping involving OAI-PHM involves resumption tokens; I 
presume SOAP has some mechanism for batching results? (http 1.1 of 
course also implements a way to batch things, though this is probably 
harder to implement on the server side)

[snip]
&gt;<i> By the way:
</I>&gt;<i> I totally agree with Matt Dovey's points detailing some of the respective
</I>&gt;<i> (in many ways complementary) strengths of REST/REST-like approaches vs
</I>&gt;<i> SOAP.
</I>
I liked his points as well.

Regards,

Martijn
