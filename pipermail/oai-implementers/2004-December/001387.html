<PRE>How did you all decide on which kind of persistent ID to use for your 
digital items?

We at USC are in the midst of implementing our DL as a DP.  The content 
thus far consists of digitized images of (physical) photographs or 
maps.   Other collections to come include born-digital and born-physical 
audio, video, papers, etc., and so on and so forth.  Currently, we have 
122,000 unique items, w/another 50,000 from the &quot;old&quot; DL system to be 
migrated by June 30th 2005.  And more to come after that....

However, we (which really means, &quot;I&quot;, as I have to make a 
recommendation) keep getting &quot;stuck&quot; on the persistent identifier 
question, particularly DOI vs Handle.  All items in the USC DL have a 
&quot;unique ID&quot;, but we just don't have any persistent IDs assigned.  
Obviously, we can't go farther w/the DP implementation if we haven't 
decided on which type of persistent ID to use.

On the one hand, I see the advantages and disadvantages of going w/the 
Handle system...and on the other hand, the advantages and disadvantages 
of choosing DOI.  At various conferences this Fall, I also received 
advice from many people, some of whom are on this list, that recommended 
one choice over the other, but the advice always contradicted the 
previous advice.  ;-)

I am putting a matrix together to examine both, but...in my frustration, 
I wonder if I shouldn't just toss a coin in the air and which ever side 
it lands on is the one I'll use....

Any thoughts or advice on this process of choosing a persistent ID? 

Or, on the pros and cons of DOI vs the Handle System?

[Btw, I looked at the OAI Best Practices wiki and did not see anything 
listed yet on this issue, so perhaps this advice/discussion can be 
adopted for the wiki.]

Thanks in advance,

Jewel
