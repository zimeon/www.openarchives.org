I disagree that it'd be dramatically easier. I think it's overestimating 
the complexity of OAI-PMH, and underestimating the complexity of SOAP.

If I had to implement the oaiphm.py module using SOAP I'd have to find 
an up to date, functional SOAP implementation in Python. Is there one 
there that's kept up to date? I've heard mixed reports. XML parsers and 
http libraries are however available everywhere.

Debugging in case something went wrong would've been a lot harder, due 
to the added layers. Performance would quite possibly also go down, due 
to the added layers. I'd need to learn SOAP *and* the OAI-PMH model; now 
I just needed to learn the OAI-PMH model.

I've heard Python/XML people say SOAP is past the hill concerning buzz, 
and that they just don't run into it.

This is an analysis of what went wrong (and right) with adding SOAP 
support to a Perl based CMS:

&gt;<i> Migrating OAI to use SOAP as its transport does seem long overdue...
</I>
Disagreed from one implementer, at least. Having to work with SOAP 
would've made this developer less happy...
