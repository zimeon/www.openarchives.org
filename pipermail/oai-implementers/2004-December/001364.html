<PRE>Just to clarify:
There is indeed an HTTP based approach of SOAP, it is called &quot;The SOAP 
HTTP Binding&quot;. Here is an complete request example from the chapter 
&quot;SOAP HTTP GET Usage&quot; of the W3C SOAP Primer [1].

GET /travelcompany.example.org/reservations?code=FT35ZBQ  HTTP/1.1
Host: travelcompany.example.org
Accept: text/html;q=0.5, application/soap+xml

The answer is in an SOAP envelope, a specific client is needed (as with 
OAI-PMH?).

For example Fedora (Open-Source Digital Repository Management System) is 
using such an approach in the Fedora-API-A-LITE [2].


Regarding the question on advantages of SOAP see the interesting 
discussion threads two years ago on &quot;OAI-PMH &amp; SOAP&quot;:
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-January/000294.html">http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-January/000294.html</A>

A person of the Inktomi company is speaking for SOAP, see:
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-January/000296.html">http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-January/000296.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-February/000306.html">http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-February/000306.html</A>

I think some of his arguments are still important. Here are some 
snippets of his arguments:
&quot;With a SOAP
interface, it would be fairly easy to build a harvester for
our search engine. It would be a very nice sample program for our
indexing interface. But with a one-of-a-kind XML protocol, it isn't
worth the trouble.

I believe that not using SOAP is a serious mistake. It means that
OAI will remain a niche protocol, with few implementations, few
users, and little positive effect.

With SOAP, you get scaling support, test suites, development tools,
supported libraries, directory service, etc. A custom protocol can
never catch up. And implementors have much better things to do
with their time than re-invent RPC.&quot;
&quot;I want that library information to be easily available to all,
not just people willing to run a library-only protocol.&quot;
&quot;With a SOAP protocol, any scripted web page can make a call to OAI.
Servers like DP9 and the repository explorer become very easy to
write. A professor's list of publications could be built from
the eprint data.&quot;
&quot;OAI is already using an XML RPC. Switching from a non-standard XML
RPC to a standard one should be an obvious decision.&quot;



As fare as I know: Google is investing in SOAP [3] but not OAI-PMH.

 &gt; It's not a question of SOAP vs. OAI, it's a question of SOAP vs. REST.
 &gt; OAI could, in theory, operate using either transport mechanism.
 &gt; Currently, the OAI protocol is based on the REST model, but some people
 &gt; prefer the SOAP model (although I can't imagine why. ;-))
 &gt;
 &gt; In general, REST refers to the use of HTTP URL requests that produce
 &gt; some form of HTTP response. This approach is so familiar to us with web
 &gt; browsing that we don't even realize it is a convention for providing
 &gt; lightweight web service like OAI and RSS.
 &gt;
 &gt; SOAP, OTOH, generally requires intelligent clients (compared to web
 &gt; browsers) that can encode requests in SOAP wrappers and decode the SOAP
 &gt; responses.
