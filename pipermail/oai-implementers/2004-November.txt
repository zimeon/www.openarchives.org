Thank you Owen, Baden and Pete for your responses.

My question stems from me being involved in a project that is creating an
open source and free distributed search tool (- JAFER:
http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/jafer/.
) that implements a JSP interface for executing Z39.50 and SRW over
repositories.

JAFER also provides software that can be 'put infront of a repository' to
translate the interoperable network query into the native DB query language
(e.g. SQL).

The interface is designed to search and select resources returned by the
search and then create a resource list compliant with the new IMS Resource
List Interoperability Specification (http://www.imsglobal.org/rli/).

I am trying to work out the practicalities of setting up SRW, OAI and
OpenURL together:

http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/srw/short-topics.html#oai

So what I need is an OAI repository that implements SRW and a openURL
resolver than can be configured with a 'Link-To syntax to OAI repositories.

1. Does anyone know of an OAI repository that does SRW?

2. Are there OAI repositories that implement 'deep linking' - hyperlink to
the full text for example, based on a simple link-to syntax?

Regards,

Howard

Hi Howard,

I have several SRW/U servers available (e.g.
http://alcme.oclc.org/srw/search/GSAFD). I then added these to an SRW
Registry at http://errol.oclc.org/srwRegistry.oclc.org.html. One of the
features of this registry is that it provides OAI gateway access to any
registered SRW service that conforms to a minimal profile (e.g.
http://errol.oclc.org/srwRegistry.oclc.org/gsafd.alcme.oclc.org.oaigateway?v
erb=Identify).

This minimal profile consists of an oai.identifier and oai.datestamp index
and an OAIHeader metadata format. Review the GSAFD SRW repository mentioned
above for details.

Let me know if you have questions.

Jeff

One of my managers has made the suggestion of creating an Apache Module

Jeff,

take a look at "mod_oai":

http://www.modoai.org/

I know the USC plans are bigger in scope than what we're doing on the
first round of mod_oai, but it might be a good platform from which to
start.

let's follow up off list.

It's an interesting approach, and you would be in good company:

We have used the SFX link server in conjunction with arXive, but with
limited success. The linking works fine, using the syntax:

http://arXiv.org/openurl-resolver?id=oai:<archive>/<archiveId>

The main problem is that the majority of references supplied to SFX don't
contain the necessary 'archive' and 'archiveId' to provide a link to the
object in the repository.

One thought I've had about this is using somekind of lookup mechanism - as
used with CrossRef to get the DOI for a specific reference. However, I
suspect to provide a useful service to the end user, we need to get more
precise about what we are linking to (pre-print, post-print, referreed or
not, etc.)

This type of refinement will obviously only be possible if it becomes
standard to record this type of information in the repositories in the first
place - and although I've seen some discussion about this, I haven't seen
anything practical come out so far.

Citebase has OpenURL resolver support for this:

OAIster have on their list of intended developments support for OpenURL and 
Z39.50 (presumably ZRW). I would hope, as OpenURL gains support, that 
individual archives will provide OpenURL resolvers and exports through OAI 
(to allow structured linking).

The "appropriate copy problem". At the moment, I think this is more a case 
of what is available. Presumably you're resolving for an article the user 
has already decided to look at, at which point the task is to provide the 
user with the most convenient access.

All the best,
Tim.

This may or may not help (perhaps if you're after some example data)
but our repository (http://epubs.cclrc.ac.uk/oai?verb=Identify) 
has an interface with CrossRef and we export both DOIs and partial 
OpenURLs in the dc:identifier field.

This provides a way for us to supply structured citation 
information in the Dublin Core metadata.

We don't have an OpenURL resolver yet.

Cheers,

I neglected to reply to the other subjects in Howard's message. 

The ERRoL service is an open-source OAI identifier resolver. A demo is
available at http://errol.oclc.org/. One of the features of the ERRoL
resolver is OpenURL access to content and services related to OAI
repositories, including links to the content being described in the oai_dc
metadata records.

Going back to the idea of providing OAI access to SRW-accessible data,
OAICat (http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.htm) has an
implementation to do just that from a local server (as opposed to the
gateway service provided by the SRW Registry I mentioned before). Contact me
for details.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Beta OAI-PMH specification re rights pertaining
	to metadata
Message-ID: <41893296.3000701@lanl.gov>

Hi all,

We are very pleased to announce the availability of a beta specification
detailing an approach to convey rights expressions pertaining to metadata
disseminated via the OAI-PMH.

This beta specification is the result of the work of the OAI-rights
technical committee that started its activities in September 2003,
following a joint initiative of the Open Archives Initiative and Project
RoMEO.

(*) The beta specification is available at:
<http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-rights.htm>

(*) The press-release that announced the launch of the OAI-rights
activity is available at:
<http://www.openarchives.org/news/oairightspress030929.html>.  This press
release includes the list of participants in the OAI-rights effort.

We hereby solicit public feedback on the specification. We aim to release
the specification by the end of 2004, and therefore request feedback by
the end of November 2004. Please send your comments to the
oai-implementers list <oai-implementers@openarchives.org>.

Greetings!

hi

looks rather interesting.

the only major comment i have is about the requirement (in para4 of 
section 3) that you may only have one <rights> package. this restriction 
seems somewhat arbitrary given that we dont know how many rights 
expression languages will emerge to be popular in the near future. in 
case there is a small (>1) set, do we really want service providers to 
map from one language to another (even if dps have that information but 
cannot encode it)?

in section 5, do you not want to also state that if a sp does not 
understand a rights statement, then that sp should ignore the metadata 
record.

and a somewhat pedantic comment:
shouldnt section 5 say: "Harvesters should look for and abide by the 
contents of ALL rights expressions included using this mechanism within 
records they harvest." instead of "any rights expressions"?

ttfn,
----hussein

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Fulltext of an document
Message-ID: <418FA9C7.4010708@syynx.de>

Hello,

I have a question about getting the fulltext of a document from an open 
archive. Take for example the following link from the www.doaj.org site:

http://www.doaj.org/oai?verb=ListRecords&from=2004-03-01&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

The returned records have two dc:identifier tags. How can I figure out, 
which one is the one pointing to the fulltext?

And as far as I understand, the metadata tag might contain data in 
diffent encodings, where Dublin Core is only one possiblity. Is that 
right? So there is no universal way to get the fulltext of a record?

Please correct me, if this is not the right list and point me to a 
better place.

regards,
Achim

The DOAJ lists journals, not texts. So you would need to go to the 
journal(s) you're interested in to work out how to extract full-texts 
from them.

Correct. I believe there are plans/work being done on a descriptive 
language for "files". Until such a tool is widely implemented, how you 
go about getting full-texts is archive-specific.

All the best,
Tim.

<about>


Any ideas would be great.

David,

<description> is used to extend Identify responses.  <about> is used to
describe individual metadata records (i.e., <about> describes the stuff
inside <metadata>).

it sounds like you want to convey information about the repository as a
whole.  if this is true, make a schema for what you would like to say and
wrap your statements inside a <description> block inside an Identify
response.

regards,

Michael

now this problem is done, you can set your OpenUrl Resolver.
Keep attention, the cookie is done to use METALIS as 'Source', not as 
'Target' (in OpenUrl jargon).

If you want to use is as Target, open the html pages and read the code. My 
forms work (I hope) with post and get without problems

But in fact if you to use it as 'Source', you need to work on your OpenUrl 
resolver.
Download the code of the SP (http://metalis.cilea.it/tajoli.tar.gz) and 
read the file openresolver.pl
The key subroutine is 'work_sp_metalis' ( lines 251 - 289)
In your OpenUrl resolver you need to register my sid (metalis).
Probably you need also to do same work in the interios of the resolver.

leaving the specification aside, i don't know whether i should feel
concerned that the examples show only creative commons examples. (i
looked at creative commons before formulating the rights statement we
use, and didn't find a combination that covered the rights i wanted to
express.)

I don't think you should be concerned about the use of Creative Commons
(CC) examples (unless perhaps you have some ideological hatred of CC).
CC was chosen as a simple example which is relevant to a number of OAI-PMH
users; the specification allows any other XML rights expression language
to be included. The introduction says:

"The described technique:
  - ...
  - Is not tied to any particular rights expression language. Examples
  throughout this document make use of Creative Commons licenses, but the
  use of this specific language is for illustrative purposes only."

We are currently working with ODRL folks on guidelines in the use of ODRL
rights expressions within the OAI context.

Cheers,
Simeon

Subject: [OAI-implementers] last-minute question about OAI-rights beta
	release
Message-ID: <6.0.1.1.0.20041130164236.01e87ea8@mail.cilea.it>

Dear Carl (met in Bath and OAI3)
and Herbert and Michael and Simeon (unfortunately never met but hopefully 
some time!),

I have carefully read the document you produced as beta release of the 
implementation guidelines for conveying rights expressions about metadata 
in the OAI-PMH protocol:
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-rights.htm

Over one year ago, I had placed the same interest in the OAI-rights white 
paper:
http://www.openarchives.org/documents/OAIRightsWhitePaper.html

What follows may be the expression of my ignorance or misunderstanding, so 
please forgive me in advance if I write nonsense!

I was expecting that an extension of the protocol would be proposed to 
convey rights expressions also about the resources, not just about their 
descriptive metadata. In a document provided by RoMEO, RoMEO Studies 6: 
Rights metadata for open-archiving:
http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/ls/disresearch/romeo/
at page 8 I read:
"Expressing rights over an individual resource via it's metadata may be 
done in two ways. All items in an OAI-compliant repository must, as a 
minimum, provide an unqualified Dublin Core metadata record for harvesting. 
One of the 15 Dublin Core elements is <dc:rights>. [...] Project RoMEO 
proposes that the rights metadata made available under the OAI-PMH is
machine readable. There are various ways this can be achieved. One way is 
to embed the rights metadata within the dc:rights element, another is to 
link to the rights metadata from within the <dc:rights> element. One way to 
implement the latter approach is to utilise a OAI GetRecord request within 
the dc:rights element. By passing a parameter such as 'oai-cc' in the 
metadataPrefix argument of the GetRecord request, actioning the request 
would result in a rights record for the resource being returned. The 
returned rights record should describe one of the 11 CC licence either in 
RDF/XML form or the  Romeo/ODRL form outlined earlier. This approach means 
that in addition to a DC record being available for each resource (eprint) 
an additional rights metadata record would also be available for each 
resource and this fact should be communicated in the data provider's 
response to the OAI-PMH ListMetadataFormats request."

Apart from the declared white-paper purpose (which I share) to deal with 
any expression, not limited to Creative Commons, my question is: was any 
proposal to convey rights about the resource via the protocol taken into 
consideration? If not, why? Is something of that kind being considered for 
the future?

Thank you very much for your patience reading so far, and thank you very 
much for the amount of beautiful work done on the protocol!!!

Best wishes,
Susanna
