One possible solution is to create virtual repository for each user (the
institutional subscriber), such as <A HREF="http://an.org/{userid}/oai,">http://an.org/{userid}/oai,</A> since
automatic URL mapping can be used, this task may not be very hard. For
each user you may have a profile which maintains access right.
