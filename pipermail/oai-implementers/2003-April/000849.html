<PRE>Hi,

If I understand your problem as follows (e.g.):

An article in Journal &quot;XML Matters&quot; appears in 2003. User &quot;John&quot; has
complete access to the journal and harvests the article in 2003. User
&quot;Daisy&quot; has access only after one year, so in 2003 is harvesting articles
from 2002. But when Daisy asks for new articles in 2004 she won't get the
article from 2003 because she is using the datestamp &quot;&gt;=2004&quot;.

I think the solution to this is to change the datestamp in the user's OAI
request to be datestamp-(user's period before access), e.g.
In 2003 Daisy requests all records &gt;=2003 - (1 year delay) = return all
records &gt;=2002

Before any records are returned to the user you will need to check their
rights to that record (in a journal they are subscribed to, date of the
article appropriate to their subscription).

I've written this as I've worked it out, so please excuse any mistakes!

All the best,
Tim.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] User Specific Archive Access


&gt;<i> Hi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am in the beginning stages of architecting an implementation of OAI
</I>&gt;<i> that will provide user-specific access to our archives and was wondering
</I>&gt;<i> if anyone knew of any other projects that have tackled this issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as background information, we are an archive with about 400
</I>&gt;<i> journal titles and millions of records.  Users will only be able to
</I>&gt;<i> harvest metadata for those journals that they have subscribed to - that
</I>&gt;<i> should be a problem I can handle.  Things get tricky when we start to
</I>&gt;<i> look at what is available WITHIN the journal.  Some users will have
</I>&gt;<i> access to the entire journal from start to finish, other users will only
</I>&gt;<i> have access to records up until a certain year (usually 5 years before
</I>&gt;<i> the present year).  This isn't so hard to manage either, until you start
</I>&gt;<i> to think about a user asking for new or changed content.  What is &quot;new&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> or changed will be different for each harvester, depending on their
</I>&gt;<i> access rights.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One possible solution to this problem is to simply give them the
</I>&gt;<i> metadata and flag it as being unavailable in some way, but this is not
</I>&gt;<i> an ideal solution.  An ideal solution is to restrict access to the
</I>&gt;<i> metadata until such time as they are permitted to harvest it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I don't expect anyone else to have encountered this specific
</I>&gt;<i> problem, but if anyone has experimented with limiting access to an
</I>&gt;<i> archive for specific users or user-groups, I would love to know about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
