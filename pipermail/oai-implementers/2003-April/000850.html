To handle access rights for the content stuff is probably beyond the scope
of metadata harvesting (see also below)

I do not think this is an optimal solution.
Nobody will know that there is some important information out there, but
one is just unable to access the content.
Nobody will ask you then how this information might become accessible.
You should share the metadata, but possibly restrict access to content.

&gt;<i> Well, I don't expect anyone else to have encountered this specific
</I>&gt;<i> problem, but if anyone has experimented with limiting access to an
</I>&gt;<i> archive for specific users or user-groups, I would love to know about it.

You can easily restrict access to your Data-Provider on HTTP level, by
using e.g. IP restriction-based access. You can also restrict the use by a
password (.htaccess for Apache..).  The URL is then e.g.
<A HREF="http://user:password@www.myarchive.org/oai?verb=....">http://user:password@www.myarchive.org/oai?verb=....</A> in order to access
the Data-Provider.
