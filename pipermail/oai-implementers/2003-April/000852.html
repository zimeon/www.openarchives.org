There are two sides to this problem. The first side is access control:

- You can use IP based restrictions, and map those IP addresses to a set of
rights. This has the drawback that the harvesters could not be switched from
one machine to another without an intervention on your part.

- You can use standard user name/password (using .htaccess) and map those
user names to a set of rights. This is a little more flexible but a little
more insecure.

- You could use user name/password over an SSL connection, again mapping
those user names to a set of rights.

The second side is below:

</I>&gt;<i> As far as background information, we are an archive with about 400

</I>&gt;<i> to think about a user asking for new or changed content.  What is &quot;new&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> or changed will be different for each harvester, depending on their
</I>&gt;<i> access rights.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One possible solution to this problem is to simply give them the
</I>&gt;<i> metadata and flag it as being unavailable in some way, but this is not
</I>&gt;<i> an ideal solution.  An ideal solution is to restrict access to the
</I>&gt;<i> metadata until such time as they are permitted to harvest it.
</I>
Personally I would not expose metadata to which the users have no right to
unless they can easily get those rights, ie buy the article. I have been
very frustrated in the past when using systems, only to be told that I could
not have the article and there was not way for me to buy it.

But if there is a simple way for users to buy an article on your system, you
might want to consider making all the metadata available to give users a
choice in search service for searching the material. This would be of
interest to me as I run the myOAI search service (<A HREF="http://www.myoai.com/">http://www.myoai.com/</A>).

In the past I built a system called ScienceServer which had a subscription
component which did just that. Each user/institution was assigned a set of
subscriptions and all they saw were what they paid to access. This allowed a
consortium to maintain a single collection, serving individual members of
that consortium a virtual collection of the journals they had subscribed to.

This is complex but quite doable, and if you are looking for a consultant to
help you with this, I would be more than happy to do so.


&gt;<i> Well, I don't expect anyone else to have encountered this specific
</I>&gt;<i> problem, but if anyone has experimented with limiting access to an
</I>&gt;<i> archive for specific users or user-groups, I would love to know about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
