Hello, about a practical Static Repository / Static Repository Gateway 
implementation, I would put in evidence the results of our experience.

Searching Google for "OAISISTEMA" it is possible to find some information 
about our SR/SRG solution that allows Archeologia e Calcolatori journal to 
be OAI data provider since 2005. Our implementation that is completely OAI 
conformant (OAIster harvests the complete collection of our resources) has 
been also designed with the target of the widest diffusion of our metadata 
on the web. An interesting study, on "Search engine Coverage of the OAI-PMH 
corpus" performed by Los Alamos National Lab (Mc Cown F., Liu X. et al., 
2006)  shows that "Archeologia e Calcolatori" repository content is 
completely indexed by Yahoo, Google and MSN, with a 100% success rate. That 
means that our target has been succesfully hit.

In my opinion, the static repository idea, with a better consideration and 
support (what about the creation of some public SR gateway for a larger 
support for such a technology?) could be a really solution for the  OA 
paradigm diffusion: in particular to support author's self archiving as well 
as small institutions and small journals access to OAI.

The URL of Archeologia  e Calcolatori journal wich is edited by CNR  is 
http://soi.cnr.it/archcalc/. OAISISTEMA software solution is based on a 
simple Access database mapping Dublin Core elements on a relational set of 
tables. A Visual basic script creates XML static repository file. Other 
additional services (to support search engine crawlers and a local search of 
the repository on our website) has been created by ASP and XSL.

I have recently started learning about OAI and need to work as a service provider. I have learned many things about OAI but haven't found any tutorial that takes me step by step to harvest from a repository.
Can anyone point me to a tutorial that will take step by step on how to use programming language to harvest data from repository.

Thanks
