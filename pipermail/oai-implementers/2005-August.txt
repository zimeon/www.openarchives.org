Speaking from the perspective of a nascent service provider, I would  
have to say "the more the merrier" when it comes to exposing metadata  
via OAI-PMH. As a service provider, I can make my own choices as to  
which metadata format I prefer to harvest, and having a much richer  
schema (albeit one that may take some review and post-processing for  
my particular purposes), is still desirable over having no choice at  
all. Having said that, I would say that I would prefer to have the  
metadata exposed as separate descriptive metadata packages if  
possible rather than in a METS wrapper, since as you know the METS  
wrapper adds complexity. Specifically, I mean the data provider might  
offer three different schemas for the metadata:

1) the required simple DC
2) a qualified DC
3) MODS

as an example. This would allow me as a service provider to easily  
consume the metadata without first having to "unpack" and understand  
your particular METS profile. Especially since we are putting the  
metadata into our own METS profile on our end ;-). My two cents, for  
what it's worth.

	scholarly information

A couple of us here are planning to play around with an experimental development project involving retrieving data from OAI-compliant repositories and seeing what sort of merging and manipulation of the data we can do.

Specifically, we are looking for pointers to OAI-compliant repositories/collections/compilations of East Asian scholarly information, regardless of language.  These could be institutional repositories, research collections, etc.

We know of some, but would welcome additional suggestions or pointers to ones we might otherwise overlook.

Thanks for any help you can provide.  This should be fun.  :)

Hi all,
We are looking for such tool...a Java-based OAI data provider tool that supports generic XML-based metadata (input and output) and requires no database for operation. So far, the tools we found are supporting just DC or crosswalked to DC. DLESE seems to do some of it (1).

Any info/help/feedback is appreciated.

Thanks Jeff but so far we tried oaicat... it doesn't deliver non-DC as far as we know...it has to be crosswalked to DC....unless we do extra programming or a kludge...we need to deliver a customized metadata (CDWA Lite xsd not DC) to be harvestable (in <metadata>).

Karim,

OAICat does support additional metadata formats, but you're right that
custom code might be needed. My guess, though, is that this would amount
to a page or two of Java and/or XSLT. Let me know if you want to look at
it again and I can lend a hand.

Thanks Jeff for your help. We favor customizing oaicat by you and inject the code in the upcoming release of oaicat... we're building a new standard for the unique objects community (Museums-like but also archives and libraries).
Let's carry this discussion offline.

OAIB supports databases out of the box but it could be extended to  
support non-database targets via its "target API".

http://dlt.ncsa.uiuc.edu/oaib/

The Target API is detailed here:

a stub implementation is provided:

Karim, and all,

FWIW, I've used the DLESE tools to serve/harvest non-DC schemas. The  
software is very easy to install (assuming tomcat + struts is already  
running).  I found that the adaptation to non-DC is quite  
straightforward.

hi ariel,

without having tested it by myself:
try http://www.eprints.org/software/ - a free software based on linux,
perl and apache, which describes itself as "OAI-compliant
OA-Archive-creating".
