<PRE>Hello

My first post to this list :)

</I>
I have a full text search and retrieval background, so my comments should be
heard in that context. I think it would be a good idea to include full text
for indexing purposes, thee more text the better the precision and recall
when performing a full text search. Of course this should be balanced
against network bandwidth at the source. I think it should made clear that
this text should be used for indexing only and not for display.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can someone clarify the differences/advantages of harvesting data directly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using OAI vs. harvesting metadata using OAI followed by harvesting data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using HTTP based on the URL in the metadata?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One reason might be that the data is available in multiple formats.
</I>&gt;<i> In our case, the URL used as an identifier is a link to an HTML article
</I>&gt;<i> which is rendered from XML. This version looks a lot better to humans and
</I>&gt;<i> the URL is, we think, the appropriate identifier for the article, but
</I>&gt;<i> obviously the HTML wouldn't be so suitable for processing as the XML
</I>&gt;<i> version. We also have PDFs.
</I>&gt;<i> Now we could provide multiple identifier URLs in the oai_dc record
</I>&gt;<i> to allow harvesting that way, I suppose - or is this a valid thing to do? It
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be allowed by the OAI Dublin Core schema:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;element name=&quot;identifier&quot;  minOccurs=&quot;0&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but I seem to remember getting the impression from somewhere that you
</I>&gt;<i> should only have one identifier. Could someone clarify this?
</I>
I think you should only have one identifier for a document. Document format
and identifier are very separate things. Multiple identifiers for a document
is going to cause confusion and separate identifiers for different formats
for a document are going to cause ever more confusion.
