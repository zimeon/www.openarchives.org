Hmmm... the protocol is named the 'The Open Archives Initiative Protocol
for Metadata Harvesting&quot;.  Using it to harvest &quot;Data&quot; seems reasonably
non-intuitive to me, given this name.

I have no problem with the notion that one person's metadata is another
person's data.  It is a pretty extreme view to say that data in the form
of the full content of an article is metadata - which is what you appear
to be saying above?

I don't disagree that the protocol *could* be used to harvest data - I
just wonder if it *should* be used in that way.  Particularly at this
stage in the life of the protocol?

Can someone clarify the differences/advantages of harvesting data directly
using OAI vs. harvesting metadata using OAI followed by harvesting data
using HTTP based on the URL in the metadata?
