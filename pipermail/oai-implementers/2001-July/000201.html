I think you should not hesitate to experiment with full data export in
the way you suggest -- so long as you understand that it is an experiment.
It seems from reactions on this list that people will experiment with
harvesting your XML full-content.

The metadata focus of OAI must remain for the moment, not for any pressing
technical reasons but simply because it is politically much easier to get a
large group of archives to export of metadata than full-content.  Without
widespread support, OAI will go nowhere. I'm sure that there will, at some
stage, be an OAI-approved way to allow harvesting of full content but I
doubt that this will be compulsory (as oai_dc metadata is).

&gt;<i>   One reason might be that the data is available in multiple formats.
</I>
Yes, the whole issue of content-models (multiple formats, multiple parts,
etc) is avoided when we consider only metadata.

&gt;<i> 	Now we could provide multiple identifier URLs in the oai_dc record
</I>&gt;<i> to allow harvesting that way, I suppose - or is this a valid thing to do? It
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be allowed by the OAI Dublin Core schema:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	&lt;element name=&quot;identifier&quot;  minOccurs=&quot;0&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  but I seem to remember getting the impression from somewhere that you
</I>&gt;<i> should only have one identifier. Could someone clarify this?
</I>
It is my understanding that having multiple identifier elements is
fine. The trouble is that there is no well defined way to say what
they mean. Note that by being an `OAI compliant archive', a data-provider
says that automated harvesting of metadata is permitted. It is not
implied that automated harvesting of full-content from URLs
specified in the identifier elements is permitted. It helps
if this is spelled out in the Identify response, e.g. in the e-prints
description section for arXiv:

    &lt;metadataPolicy&gt;
     &lt;text&gt;Metadata harvesting permitted through OAI interface&lt;/text&gt;
     &lt;URL&gt;<A HREF="http://arXiv.org/help/oa/metadataPolicy</URL">http://arXiv.org/help/oa/metadataPolicy&lt;/URL</A>&gt;
    &lt;/metadataPolicy&gt;
    &lt;dataPolicy&gt;
     &lt;text&gt;Full-content harvesting not permitted (except by special
arrangement)&lt;/text&gt;
     &lt;URL&gt;<A HREF="http://arXiv.org/help/oa/dataPolicy</URL">http://arXiv.org/help/oa/dataPolicy&lt;/URL</A>&gt;
    &lt;/dataPolicy&gt;


Cheers,
Simeon.
