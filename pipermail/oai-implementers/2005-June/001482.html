</I>
It was intended to mean only the most recent changes. Thus, only the last
modification date for each record needs to be recorded. Looking at the
spec I see it is only implied that records have a single datestamp
associated with them:

spec&gt; ... A repository must update the datestamp of a record if a change
spec&gt; occurs, the result of which would be a change to the metadata part
spec&gt; of the XML-encoding of the record. Such changes include, but
spec&gt; are not limited to, changes to the metadata of the record, changes
spec&gt; to the metadata format of the record, introduction of a new
spec&gt; metadata format, termination of support for a metadata format, etc

&gt;<i> On the other hand, there seems to be no requirement that a modified
</I>&gt;<i> record gets exposed in its original, historical state; i.e. historical
</I>&gt;<i> revisions of metadata do not need to be retained to comply. This means
</I>&gt;<i> that in fact someone harvesting between 2005-03-01 - 2005-05-01 would
</I>&gt;<i> see all records in the most recent state anyway, thus including the
</I>&gt;<i> 2005-06-05 change.
</I>
Records are only ever exposed in their current state, a complete
modification history is not required.

&gt;<i> It therefore seems that for incremental date-based harvesting to work,
</I>&gt;<i> full historical information about modification dates is not strictly
</I>&gt;<i> necessary, as at the end of a full harvest throughout the full date
</I>&gt;<i> range all the data *will* be correctly sent to the harvester..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tracking a full history of modification dates for all records seems like
</I>&gt;<i> an onerous requirement. Is this really the intent? Does it really hurt
</I>&gt;<i> if only last-modified dates are retained?
</I>
Correct, only the last-modified dates need to be maintained.

Cheers,
Simeon
