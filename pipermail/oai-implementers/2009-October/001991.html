<PRE>Hi:

Pardon me as this is probably a very dumb question. But how might one send
vanilla XML (either with DTD or without - but no schema) as an OAI-PMH
metadata record? That is, to use OAI-PMH as a delivery mechanism for
arbitary XML.

Is there any generic schema-based XML wrapper that could be used? Or could
the XML be sent as oai_dc property? Or might there be some other way to
approach this?

Cheers,

Tony
