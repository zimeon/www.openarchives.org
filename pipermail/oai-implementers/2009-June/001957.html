In conjunction with ECDL 2009

###### Workshop Objectives ######

The implementation of nowadays Digital Libraries is more demanding than in
the past. Information consumers are facing with the need to access ever
growing, heterogeneous, possibly federated Information Spaces while
information providers are interested in satisfying such needs by sharing
rich and organised views over their information deluge. Because of their
fundamental role of information production and dissemination vehicle,
Digital Libraries are also expected to provide information society with
services that must be available 24/7 and guarantee the expected quality of
service. This scenario leads to the development of &#236;Very Large Digital
Libraries&#238; in terms of number of Information Objects and Collections to be
made available, users to be served and potentially distributed resources
needed to implement such systems. Such systems have to confront with new
challenges in a context having scalability, interoperability and
sustainability as focal points.

Interestingly, however, there is no clear and well-accepted definition of
Very Large Digital Library (VLDL). Some, in an attempt to give one, blur the
separation between Very Large Databases (VLDBs) and VLDLs and regard the
latter as VLDBs storing Digital Library content. Since in databases the
adjective &#236;Very large&#238; strictly refers to &#236;size of content&#238;, the implication
is that, similarly, VLDLs ought to be DLs storing digital content beyond a
given storage threshold. Despite being intuitively correct, this explanation
does not fully satisfy DL practitioners. Indeed, DL content design paradigms
cannot be conceptually separated by the relative functionalities as it
happens for DBs. DLs are of use to peculiar user communities whose
functionality needs, best practices and behaviour are well-accepted DL
systems requirements. As captured by the DELOS reference model for DLs, user
management, content management, functionality management, and policies are
equally important in the definition of a DL. Accordingly, as demonstrated by
real DL system experiences, VLDLs should be described as DLs featuring &#236;very
large features&#238; in one or more of such aspects.

The goal of this workshop is to provide researchers, practitioners and
application developers with a forum fostering a constructive exchange among
all key actors in the field of Very Large Digital Libraries. The workshop
will also be the opportunity to answer the open questions that had arisen
during VLDL first successful edition at ECDL 2008 (ref. VLDL2008 Workshop
Report, published in SIGMOD Records 2009).

###### Workshop topics ######

Topics of this workshop are of interest to, but not limited to, the
following research avenues:

Foundational topics

----------------

Definitional models, for VLDL content, functionality, users, and policies
(DELOS reference model):

- Architectural models for VLDL systems;

- Data models for VLDL content;

- Design methodologies for VLDLs.

System topics

----------------

Ideas, experiments and practical experiences in system design and

implementation:

- Integration and federation of existing DLs;

- User management in VLDLs;

- Security issues in VLDLs;

- Sustainability issues in VLDLs;

- Scalability issues in VLDLs;

- Distribution issues for VLDLs;

- Interoperability issues for VLDL content and functionalities;

- Quality of Service measures and operation of VLDLs;

- Storing and indexing issues in VLDL content;

- Preservation issues for VLDL content.

###### Important Dates ######

Paper submission deadline: July 6th, 2009

Notification of acceptance: July 31st, 2009

Submission of camera-ready papers: September 6, 2009

###### Paper Submission ######

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers.

Submitted manuscripts will have to be limited to 8 pages, following the
guidelines for the LNCS format provided by Springer. Preferred formats are
PDF or Microsoft Word. Papers should be submitted via email to
<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/mailman/listinfo/oai-implementers">vldl2009 at isti.cnr.it.</A> Papers submitted to the workshop will undergo a
peer-review process by Program Committee members. For every accepted
contribution, at least one author will be required to attend the workshop
and present the paper. Accepted papers will be published as a volume in the
DELOS workshop proceedings series (ISBN), which will also be made available
in the DELOS digital library.
