Subject: [OAI-implementers] Document usage into institutional repositories 
Message-ID: <48E5FF54.7060807@ifremer.fr>

Hello,

I have to prepare a study about the usage of the documents available 
into Archimer <http://www.ifremer.fr/docelec/>, our Institutional 
repository.

Here are some of the first results:

    *  There is now more than 3700 documents available freely (about
      2000 publications, 500 reports, 60 books, 900 conferences
      proceedings). 46% of these documents have been published after
      2000. These documents are mainly about life sciences but there are
      also some documents about physics, Geology...

    * It seems that 90% of the full-texts are downloaded directly from
      Google. Then, the success of a document is of course linked to its
      quality but also to technical aspects:

    * Documents that have a large number of pages (ex: theses) are more
      downloaded that document that have a few pages (ex: publications)

    * It seems than Google does not index documents that are bigger than
      10Mo. Then documents bigger than 10Mo are then downloaded 10 less
      times than other documents

    * Even if the documents are downloaded from Google, we can detect a
      high proportion of universities and scientific institutions in users.

    * Documents that are only available into our repository are, of
      course, more downloaded that documents that are available in many
      places. This is particularly true for publications. Recent
      international publications, that are also available from editor
      web site, are less downloaded that old publications that are only
      available from our repository.

    * It seems that the first one that put a document have a kind of
      bonus from Google. For example, when we put a publication on line
      before the editor, it seems that it is more downloaded, even after
      the publication on the Editor Web site. When we load a publication
      several months after it was available on editor web site, it can
      hardly be found on Google.   

    * In march 2008 (march is usually the higher month for stats), the
      documents were downloaded in the following way:
          o Reports average: 20 downloads (min : 0, max: 200)
          o Theses average: 50 downloads (min : 0, max: 300)
          o Publications average: 8 downloads (min : 0, max: 70)
          o Conference proceedings average: 15 downloads (min : 0, max: 100)


    * The average rate of downloads have decreases since last year.
      Indeed, the documents loaded after July 2007 match about 44% of
      the total documents available into our repository. However these
      44% documents match only 22% of the downloads during September
      2008. this is a little bit disturbing and I am not sure of the causes:
          o There are more and more documents available on the internet,
            so maybe it is more and more difficult for a document to be
            visible
          o Maybe there is a kind of a self saturation. For example,
            1000 of the 37000 documents are about oysters (which is one
            of the main research subjects in our institute). There are
            clearly some documents (ex: annual survey reports) that are
            quite similar, so there are not as interesting as there was
            all original search results.
          o Even if the full text are indexed quite quickly by Google,
            maybe it take some time before the new documents appear in
            top of google list.


Could you please tell me if you have the same comments on your own 
repository?

    * What is the average download rate per type of documents in your
      repository?
    * Does it increase or decrease when the number of documents is
      increasing?
    * ...


Thanks for your help.

Kind regards,
Fred

Hi,

We have been using for a while the OAICat software, the OAI-PMH repository
Java framework from the OCLC
(http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.htm.)

This library generates a "description" node in the Identify response with a
reference to this schema:
http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/OAI/metadata/toolkit.xsd

We've noted that in the last days the address "oai.dlib.vt.edu" is not
working. The DNS is resolving the address to the IP 128.173.49.52
(rocky.dlib.vt.edu), but the server doesn't respond.

As the address does not work, the scheme file cannot be found, and our
repository is not correctly validated.

Does anyone know if this error can be avoided in some way, if the schema has
moved or if the server will be running again in the future?

Thanks,

Jes?s L. Dom?nguez Muriel
DIGIBIS S.L.

Jes?s,

The XML Schema specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/#UsingSchemaLocationInQuarterly) states that "the schemaLocation is only a hint and some processors and applications will have reasons to not use it." The possibility that any given XML Schema can vanish from the web in an instant is one such reason. For this reason, it is safest to keep local copies of XML Schemas and use those for validation rather than routinely trust the schemaLocation.

It's possible that this schema is permanently AWOL. The workaround would be to create your own local stub replacement schema and configure your validator to use that instead of the one in the schemaLocation.

hi

sorry about the error ... this came up recently in a different community 
forum but was not fixed - i will try to resolve the problem as soon as 
possible.

unfortunately the missing server is at Virginia Tech and i moved on many 
years ago. i will try to get them to either resurrect the machine or 
transfer the domain to where i am now ...

ttfn,
----hussein

[Sorry for cross posting and thanks for your help!]

I'm starting a project to improve the shareability of the metadata records
in our DSpace repository. I'm gathering up some reading material for my
intern, and I'd like to give him something about OAI-PMH in DSpace (how's
it's implemented, what settings you can control, how to query it, etc.).
Does anyone know of a good overview? The only things I can find are vague
references in FAQs and technical queries on listserves...

Thanks!
Melanie

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Stored procedures references in oaicat.properties
Message-ID: <A03B064D174640CF9ACC61A4CA5BE817@DDLXSD1J>

Hi to all!

I'm quite new to OAI and to this list, so pardon me if the topic has been
addressed before.

The question is:
- Is it possible to include references to stored procedures, instead of
plain SQL queries, in the corresponding JDBCOAICatalog entries in
oaicat.properties?

We're using a rather complex Oracle database (it's a bibliographic
information repository based on ONIX for Books) and I would prefer to create
a more "OAI-like" shell by using stored procedures and views, than to
develop Java classes for data access and metadata transformations.

Thanks a lot in advance.

Dear Colleagues,

It is indeed my pleasure to introduce to you the Globethics.net
Library, launched on 9 October 2008 in a press conference in Geneva.
The Library is an endeavour by Globethics.net to bring together
open-access and toll-access literature in ethics in a single digital
library for the use of associated community (Globethics.net Network).
While we are still improving content, technology and resource
discovery of the website, we want to invite you to join us and help us
in improving this service by giving your insightful feedback.

Also, I would like to thank you for sharing your knowledge on various
aspects and questions in development of the Library, with particular
reference to OAI-PMH integration, metadata quality, among others.
Below are some representative links of the consultations done in your
forum during this time period.

JPeraita,

The JDBCOAICatalog class uses the java.sql.Statement class. I believe
that stored procedures require the java.sql.CallableStatement class
instead. Sorry.

In principle, though, you could write a knockoff of this class to call
stored procedures instead of SQL queries. This new class can be
configured by changing the AbstractCatalog.oaiCatalogClassName entry in
the oaicat.properties file. 

Some clues about customization can be found here:
http://alcme.oclc.org/wikid/CollectionOaiCat:CustomizationNotes.
