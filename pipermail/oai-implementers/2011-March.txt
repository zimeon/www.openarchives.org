DC-2011 Call for Papers
=========================

International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications:
"Metadata Harmonization: Bridging Languages of Description"

21-23 September 2011, The Hague, Netherlands

----------------------------------
DEADLINES & IMPORTANT DATES:
Submission Deadline: 16 April 2011
Author Notification: 18 June 2011
Final Copy: 23 July 2011
----------------------------------

Metadata is an increasingly central tool in the current web
environment, enabling large-scale, distributed management
of resources.  Recent years has seen a growth in interaction
between previously relatively isolated metadata communities,
driven by the need for cross-domain collaboration and
exchange.  However, metadata standards have not been able
to meet the needs of interoperability between independent
standardization communities.  For this reason the notion
of metadata harmonization, defined as interoperability of
combinations of metadata specifications, has arisen as a core
issue for the future of web-based metadata. Resting at the
heart of application profiles, metadata harmonization presents
a little understood, but critical challenge in design of
languages of description.  DC-2011 will explore the conceptual
and practical issues of design when the language solution calls
for cross-fertilization from different metadata specifications.

Beyond the conference theme, papers, reports, and poster
submissions are welcome on a wide range of metadata topics,
such as:

-- Metadata principles, guidelines, and best practices
-- Metadata quality (methods, tools, and practices)
-- Conceptual models and frameworks (e.g., RDF, DCAM, OAIS)
-- Application profiles
-- Metadata generation (methods, tools, and practices)
-- Metadata interoperability across domains, languages,
    time, structures, and scales.
-- Cross-domain metadata uses (e.g., recordkeeping, preservation,
    curation, institutional repositories, publishing)
-- Domain metadata (e.g., for corporations, cultural memory
    institutions, education, government, and scientific fields)
-- Bibliographic standards (e.g., RDA, FRBR, subject headings)
    as Semantic Web vocabularies
-- Accessibility metadata
-- Metadata for scientific data, e-Science and grid applications
-- Social tagging and user participation in building metadata
-- Usage data (paradata/attention metadata)
-- Knowledge Organization Systems (e.g., ontologies, taxonomies,
    authority files, folksonomies, and thesauri) and Simple Knowledge
    Organization Systems (SKOS)
-- Ontology design and development
-- Integration of metadata and ontologies
-- Search engines and metadata
-- Linked data and the Semantic Web (metadata and applications)
-- Vocabulary registries and registry services

SUBMISSIONS

All submissions for papers, reports, poster
abstracts, and community workshop and special
session must do so through the DCMI Peer Review System at
http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/dc-2011/schedConf/cfp
(see submission link at bottom of page).  Author registration
with the peer review system and instructions for the submission
process appear under the "Information for Authors" link.

-- All submissions must be in English.
-- All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the International Program
    Committee.

Publication

-- Accepted papers, project reports and poster abstracts will
    be published in the official Conference Proceedings at
    http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/ojs/pubs.
-- Special session and community workshop session abstracts
    will be published in the online conference program.
-- Papers, research reports and poster abstracts must conform
    to the appropriate formatting template available through the
    DCMI Peer Review System.
-- Unless previously arranged, accepted papers, project reports
    and posters must be presented at The Hague by at least one of
    their authors.
-- Submitting authors in all categories must provide basic
    information regarding current professional positions and
    affiliations as a condition of acceptance and publication.

FULL PAPERS (8-10 pages)

Full papers either describe innovative work in detail or
provide critical, well-referenced overviews of key developments
or good practice in the areas outlined above. Full papers
will be assessed using the following criteria:

-- Originality of the approach to the topic and potential for
    implementation
-- Quality of the contribution to the implementation community
-- Significance of the results presented
-- Clarity of presentation

PROJECT REPORTS (4-5 pages)

Project reports describe a specific model, application, or
activity in a concise presentation. Project reports will be
assessed using the following criteria:

-- Conciseness and completeness of technical description
-- Usability of the technical description by other potential
    implementers
-- Clarity of presentation

POSTERS (1-2 pages)

Posters are for the presentation of projects or research under
development or late-breaking results. Poster proposals should
consist of a one-two page extended abstract.  Posters will
be assessed using the following criteria:

-- Concise statement of research or project goals and milestones
-- Significance of the research or project
-- Framing of key barriers and future research
-- Statement of results and accomplishments
-- Clarity of presentation

One or more sessions will be scheduled for display and
discussion of posters at the conference venue.   Instructions
on the preparation of the display poster will be forthcoming on
the conference website.  Unless otherwise arranged, accepted
posters must be presented at The Hague by at least one of
their authors.  However, with prior arrangement, posters
abstracts may be included in the published proceedings and
presented by means of video ranging from 4-10 minutes in
length and uploaded to YouTube with the URL supplied at the
time the poster abstract is submitted.

SPECIAL SESSIONS & DCMI COMMUNITY WORKSHOP SESSIONS

Proposals for special sessions and community workshop
sessions should be 800-1,200 words in length including a
35-50 word abstract for use in publicizing the session.
Session proposals must identify the:

-- Session conveners
-- Where applicable, categories of target participants
-- Session:
    o Purpose
    o Agenda
    o Activities (including any technical requirements)
    o Ramp-up and follow-through (including after-conference reporting)
    o Workshop session proposals must identify the specific DCMI community
      (see http://www.dublincore.org/groups/#communities)

Conveners of accepted sessions will be expected to work
closely with the Workshop Chair to refine, schedule and
convene their session. The Workshop Chair, in consultation
with the Conference Committee, will review special session
proposals.  The Workshop Chair, in consultation with the
chairs/co-chairs of the relevant DCMI communities, will review
community workshop proposals.  Evaluation criteria for session
proposals will be: (1) quality and organization of content,
(2) justification of format; (3) evidence of interactivity
and participatory approaches; (3) inclusivity/diversity
of participation; and (4) the potential of the session
to engage the conference participants in general and, for
workshop sessions, the community of interest in particular
(including any necessary technical outreach beyond the venue
(e.g., Skype)).

Subject: [OAI-implementers] embedded xml / namespaces
Message-ID: <db77ce8d10e36c9131017efd9b3f7c01.squirrel@webmail.ifi.lmu.de>

Hi,

when embedding xml in GetRecord and ListRecords responses one has to make
a decision on how to deal with namespaces. If a namespace is declared both
in the conatainer OAI xml and the embedded xml document, it is correct
behaviour for a xml library to remove the redundant inner declaration.
However, a naive harvester that just cuts out the embedded xml will loose
the namespace declaration, making the document invalid.

Different OAI providers implement different behaviour here. joai seems to
fully embed the xml document, without any changes to namespace
declarations. Other implementations, however, treat the oai response as a
full xml document, removing duplicate namespace declarations.

The following two links illustrate this. Both metadata records originally
defined a xsi xml schema namespace (although they are not the same
document). The OAI GetRecord response also defines xsi. In the first one
the embedded xml retains the xsi declaration, in the second it does not.

http://china2.dwd.de:8080/oai/provider?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=iso19139&identifier=urn:x-wmo:md:int.wmo.wis.test3::ULBU01_LZSO

http://openwis-oai.akka.eu/openwis-admin-portal/srv/en/oaipmh?verb=GetRecord&identifier=urn:x-wmo:md:int.wmo.wis.test5::FKIO20FMEE&metadataPrefix=iso19139

Does anyone have a guideline how xml that gets embedded into the OAI
response xml has to be treated namespace-wise?

best regards
Timo
