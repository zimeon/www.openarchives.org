Subject: [OAI-implementers] Announcement of 2nd Open Archives Forum workshop, Lisbon, December 2002
Message-ID: <037c01c2696f$f72a8340$2c92268a@ULPCLC>

Apologies to those who may receive this announcement on more than one
mailing list.

OPEN ACCESS TO HIDDEN RESOURCES
2nd Open Archives Forum Workshop

The organizing committee is very pleased to announce the 2nd Open
Archives Forum Workshop, which will be held in Lisbon
on 6-7 December, 2002. Registration will open soon on the Open
Archives Forum website (http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/).

The objective of this workshop is to bring together organizations that
work in the archival and library fields in order explore whether, and
under what conditions, the open archive approach is viable for these
organisations. It also intends to promote the establishment of new
collaborative links aimed at building interoperable infrastructures
for supporting the dissemination of both archival and library
resources. A tutorial on the implementation of the Open Archives
Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) will be held the
afternoon before the workshop for those people who are not familiar
with this protocol.

The workshop will consist of both presentations given by invited
speakers and small groups' breakout sessions where the participants
can discuss key issues, such as:
* How far OAI-PMH is applicable to the electronic records of
traditional archives, whether historical or "born digital";
* To what extent OAI-PMH and Dublin Core have been tried out and
accepted in the library community;
* Can OAI-PMH enable innovative ways of cross-domain collaboration
between archival and library communities?
* How far OAI-PMH crosses over with other interoperability standards
and concepts, such as Z39.50 and web services.

One of the workshop speakers will be Carl Lagoze (NSDL) representing
the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) with an update on OAI activities.
Other speakers will include:
* George Mackenzie (National Archives of Scotland)
* Jose' Borbinha (National Library of Portugal)
* Mark Bide (Rightscom)

Who should attend.
* archivists and librarians who are considering opening their
repositories of information;
* technical, research and project managers who are interested in
providing services on interoperable open archives and libraries
* decision makers in the area of libraries and archives looking for
new strategic opportunities to promote their organizations and working
areas

Dear group members,
I am happy to inform that the problem with the CompleteListSize was =
just a
misplaced curly brace in the routine...

We have solved almost all the schema issues on our proprietary =

now we will concentrate our efforts on the UTF-8 issue...

thanks to all!

(Only tested using the Perl expat parser  ...)

I don't *think* your solution will cover all situations (e.g., it didn't
encode the last of the three example latin characters). Exhaustively parsing
all 8-bit character codes produces the following required regexps to go from
raw any-ascii text to UTF-8 parsable (i.e. a shot-gun approach):

s/&/&amp;/sg;
s/</&lt;/sg;
s/>/&gt;/sg;
s/[\x00-\x08\x0b-\x0c\x0e-\x1f]//sg;
s/([\x80-\xff])/sprintf("&#x%04x;",ord($1))/seg;

This will delete any control characters that aren't valid Unicode, and
entity-encode characters above 127 (note, there are control characters above
127 in the Unicode database but these seem to be accepted by the parser
...).

It would still be better to use a proper encoding transform than rely on
regexps :-)

Regards,
Tim.

We use Perl's sprintf function. For instance:
$creators =~ s/([^<>:a-zA-Z, .\/-])/sprintf "&#x%04X;", ord($1)/ei;

which converts everything but the characters within brackets to their
hexadecimal value and adds the "&#X" required for Unicode encoding.

Tim mentioned encoding support in perl5.8 in his earlier post and I tried
it out some time ago. It seems pretty good and is probably a good 
solution if the data coming from your database is in a well-defined (and 
supported) encoding such as latin1.

I played with the "from_to" function supplied by the "Encode" module and
it seems very easy to use. These functions will write multi-byte
characters instead of entities but that is fine.

The entity encoding of gt, lt, amp and quot is a separate XML issue which
should be handled by whatever XML writing code you are using.

Cheers,
Simeon.





Code I played with is below, test with:

simeon@ice ~>echo "çãö" | convert-encoding.pl -f ISO-8859-1 -t utf8
Ã§Ã£Ã¶
simeon@ice ~>

where the gibberish Ã§Ã£Ã¶ is actually the correct utf8 bytes displayed
incorrectly on my terminal, perhaps octal makes it more obvious:

simeon@ice ~>echo "çãö" | convert-encoding.pl -f ISO-8859-1 -t utf8 | hexdump -c
0000000 303 247 303 243 303 266  \n                                    



#!/usr/bin/perl5.8.0
#
use strict;
use Getopt::Std;
use vars qw($opt_f $opt_t $opt_h);
my $FROM='utf8';
my $TO='utf8';
unless ((&getopts('f:t:h') && !$opt_h)) {
  die "usage: $0 [-f from] [-t to] [-h]\n
Convert bytestream from one encoding to another.
  -f from   set incoming encoding [default $FROM]
  -t to     set outgoing encoding [default $TO]
  -h        this help.\n";
}
my $from = $opt_f || $FROM;
my $to = $opt_t || $TO;
use Encode 'from_to';

undef $/; #make read to string slurp all file 
my $data=<STDIN>;
&from_to($data, $from, $to); # from legacy to utf-8  
print $data;

Don't know if anyone has mentioned it on this list yet but the module:

 Unicode::String

is pretty useful for this character set business too...

Greetings,

Please be aware that there seems to be some subtle issues with 5.8 and
XML::Parser and XML::DOM that have cropped up on the perl-xml mailing
list. See for instance

Sorry if this is a dumb question, but what's the difference
between a "resource" and an "item" as it relates to the OAI-PMH?
Thanks for any clarification.

See: 
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm#DefinitionsConcepts 
 
Consider the example of a meteorite in a museum:
o resource: the meteorite (a real, physical object in this case)
o item: details recorded about the resource in the repository, might  
  include: 
  name="Fred's Meteorite";
  year-found="1996";
  weight="2lbs"
o record: a record disseminated in oai_dc might include the fields: 
  dc:title="Fred's Meteorite";
  dc:date="1996";
  dc:description="weighs 2lbs" 

Hope this helps,
Simeon

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAI 2.0 schema and Xerces 2.2.0
Message-ID: <46D7B75B426D7C4C9432E3E96B7D9F6A055A4F@opus.cs.cornell.edu>

There is a problem with schema validation of oai_dc for 2.0:

	http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd

and Xerces 2.2.0.  It really is a problem with the included schema:

	http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/simpledc20020312.xsd

as I reported to DC-Architecture in the message below.

Earlier versions of Xerces don't seem to complain.


Thanks to John Weatherley at DLESE for finding this.

Xerces 2.2.0 does not like the schema at

	http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/simpledc20020312.xsd


The issue is that Xerces 2.2.0 complains if you assign a namespace prefix to the XML namespace URI: http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace   (though it is still fine to import it.)   This behavior is currently peculiar to Xerces 2.2.0 ... but I'm not sure if Xerces 2.2.0 is right or wrong in it's complaint.


This could be fixed if the "x" namespace declaration was removed (leave the import), and references to it used the "xml" prefix instead:

<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:x="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" xmlns="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" targetNamespace="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" elementFormDefault="qualified" attributeFormDefault="unqualified">

becomes

<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" targetNamespace="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" elementFormDefault="qualified" attributeFormDefault="unqualified">


and 

<xs:complexType name="elementType">
- <xs:simpleContent>
- <xs:extension base="xs:string">
  <xs:attribute ref="x:lang" use="optional" /> 
  </xs:extension>
  </xs:simpleContent>
  </xs:complexType>

becomes

DOG - The Dienst 4.1  Open-Archive 1.1  Gateway (Moved to new location)
_____________________________________________________________


DOG   - The Dienst (4.1) to Open-Archive (1.1) Gateway has moved.

I am pleased to also announce that I have begun working on DOG Version 
2.0,
which will be compliant with the OAI-PMH 2.0 .  I am working on this,
with the support of Michael Nelson(ODU).

Test Site:      http://www.cs.odu.edu/~tharriso/DOG/gateway.html


Purpose
________________
The purpose of DOG is to make it possible for OAI enabled services to 
make
requests to, and permit harvesting of, any archive that supports Dienst
4.1 protocol requests, by using OAI 1.1 formatted requests. This service
may be used to make OAI calls to any Dienst archive. This service is
offered to the digital library community at large and may be called
remotely (to our server at ODU), or may be installed locally (at
conclusion of Beta review).


Features
________________
1.  Permits OAI calls to Dienst servers that support Dienst 4.1 protocol
     requests.
2.  Handles all OAI 1.1 verb request and all verb arguments.
     example: "until" argument implemented ( where no equivalent exists in
     Dienst 4.1)
3.  Requests for records (GetRecord) may be made with either Dienst
     formatted handle or OAI formatted  identifier.
4.  Handles archives that contain multiple repository identifiers.


Basic Request Format
_______________

Testing
______________
Dog has been tested on:
www.icase.edu
ncstrl.mit.edu
ncstrl.gmd.de
dienst.iei.pi.cnr.it

The URL at the top of this message will take you to the DOG Test Site.
Your feedback is welcomed.



Summary
______________
The goal of this project is to create a gateway between OAI 1.1 protocol
and the Dienst 4.1 Protocol. It is worthy to note that the scope of this
gateway is limited to scope of the OAI protocol and does not include
auxiliary services that may exist within a Dienst framework.

DOG has been written in JAVA and will be available (after BETA testing) 
to
interested parties, as a tar file, for optional local implementation. It
is not necessary to install DOG locally, as calls may be made it directly
as currently implemented at ODU. It is currently being run on a BETA
server at Old Dominion University, and will more to a more permanent
location at the conclusion of BETA testing.


I look forward to your comments,

When verb ListMetadataFormats is sent with no arguments it should return
a list of all metadata formats supported by the repository.

What is the proper usage or functionality of ListMetadataFormats when
the optional argument 'identifier' is included?

I have just started to look in making my databases OAI compliant.
I am currently running an image search engine which users use to search for
images and return results via a web page. All the pages are ASP with VBScript
and JavaScript.
The data is contained within a table in SQL server. What I am confused about
is, the table I am going to create for the metadata is going to contain
duplicate data e.g. contributor, date added etc... as these are all required
to be displayed to user upon a search request.

My basic understanding (which I think is wrong at the moment) is I'll have my
main table which houses all the data, then a smaller table which contains
metadata about each record, which is in a valid XML format.
Are there any other factors which I need to be aware of for my databases?

I'm trying to comprehend the workings but it's not very clear.

Thank you for you help.
John

Message-ID: <3DAE8BFA.3000509@kbr.be>

Hi,

can anyone tell me where I can find a metadata scheme for the delivery 
of OAI records in the UNIMARC metadata format? Are there also some tools 
available for translating UNIMARC to MARC21 and Dublic core?

Kind regards,

Mark

You can then create the necessary XML out of your metadata on-the-fly
(as you create your HTML out of your SQL).
For the Data Provider there is no need to store the data in XML format.

You can find a sample implementation in PHP (which also runs under
Windows) at http://physnet.uni-oldenburg.de/oai/ which does exactly that
(fetch SQL, map it, create XML).

All you need to do is to adjust the mappings from your personal data
to DC. If you prefer ASP, it should be quite easy to make ASP code
out of this.

When the optional argument identifier is included in the 
ListMetadataFormats request then only the metadata formats that a record 
with this identifier can be delivered in, will be returned.

John-

And in addition to solutions offered by Heinrich and Jeff, see:

http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/ProviderTools/TemplateAReadme.htm

for an example of an OAI ver. 1.1 provider that uses ASP - ODBC - MS Access.
We've not yet posted the OAI 2.0 version of this, and of course your
database schema will undoubtedly be different, but this implementation may
give you some additional ideas.

Mark,

If you don't hear from other UNIMARC users, you may want to contact the
UNIMARC maintenance agency (currently the Deutsche Bibliothek, but with
transfer to the National Library of Portugal planned) to see if they have
concrete plans.  The UNIMARC strategic plan certainly indicates an
intention to develop tools for "interoperability of metadata."
  http://www.ifla.org/VI/3/annual/spunimarc.htm

The Library of Congress Network Development and MARC Standards Office has
recently mounted a mapping (as a document) from UNIMARC to MARC21.

Tim,

Per a previous email on the oai-general listserv, there is a workshop
going on right now in Geneva and they are webcasting it.  They are also
providing archives for access.  Not quite the same as a true workshop -
but certainly closer than Geneva.
=20
Here's the message:
The "2nd Workshop on the Open Archives Initiative (OAI): Gaining
independence with e-prints archives" will be held from Thursday to
Saturday (17-19 October) at CERN, in Geneva:
http://library.cern.ch/Announcement.htm
=20
The registration was such a success that we were unfortunately not able
to accept all the people who wanted to attend the workshop. We thought
that a workshop dedicated to the OAI and some related initiatives should
also be as open as possible ; that's why we decided to "webcast" it.
=20
Webcasted lectures:
The webcasted talks will be available only a few minutes after the end
of each speaker's presentation. To watch a webcasted lecture, you will
have to go to the workshop agenda:
=20
http://doc.cern.ch/age?a02333
=20
A link will appear next to the title of each lecture, as soon as
available. You will find to kind of files:
- video files
- video files synchronized with PowerPoint presentations
=20
The lectures will be archived and we will keep them linked from the
workshop agenda.

Amy

Message-ID: <B1D41F4ABBC45949BC3539F5831D442504462C@EXCHVS2.cs.cornell.edu>


Open Access to 

Hidden Resources

 

6-7th December 2002, Lisbon, Portugal

http://www.oaforum.org <http://www.oaforum.org/>  

 

 

(Registration deadline: 1st November 2002)

 

The organizing committee is very pleased to announce the 2nd Open Archives Forum Workshop, which will be held in Lisbon on 6-7 December, 2002. Registration is open on the Open Archives Forum website (http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/).

 

The objective of this workshop is to bring together organizations that work in the archival and library fields in order explore whether, and under what conditions, the open archive approach is viable for these organisations. It also intends to promote the establishment of new collaborative links aimed at building interoperable infrastructures for supporting the dissemination of both archival and library resources. A tutorial on the implementation of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) will be held the afternoon before the workshop for those people who are not familiar with this protocol.

 

The workshop will consist of both presentations given by invited speakers and small groups' breakout sessions where the participants can discuss key issues, such as:

* How far OAI-PMH is applicable to the electronic records of traditional archives, whether historical or "born digital";

* To what extent OAI-PMH and Dublin Core have been tried out and accepted in the library community;

* Can OAI-PMH enable innovative ways of cross-domain collaboration between archival and library communities?

* How far OAI-PMH crosses over with other interoperability standards and concepts, such as Z39.50 and web services.

 

Invited speakers include:

 

* Jose' Borbinha (National Library of Portugal)

* Goran Kristiansson (The Regional Archives in Lund)

* Carl Lagoze (Cornell University) 

* George Mackenzie (National Archives of Scotland)

* Mark Bide (Rightscom)

 


Who should attend


 

* archivists and librarians who are considering opening their

repositories of information;

* technical, research and project managers who are interested in providing services on interoperable open archives and libraries

* decision makers in the area of libraries and archives looking for new strategic opportunities to promote their organizations and working areas

About Open Archives Forum.

The Open Archives Forum provides a Europe-based focus for dissemination of information about European activity related to open archives and, in particular, to the Open Archives Initiative. The aim of the Forum is to facilitate clustering of IST projects, national initiatives and other parties interested in the open archives approach. In order to do so, OA-Forum brings interested parties together to build a community of interest, enable exchange of information and establish a web-based European information source for open archives. In addition, OA-Forum undertakes comparative reviews of technical and organisational issues. OA-Forum is funded as an accompanying measure within the Information Societies Technology (IST) Programme, a theme of the European Union's Fifth Framework Programme managed by the Information Society Directorate-General of the European Commission. The partners of OAF are: University of Bath-UKOLN (United Kingdom), Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie della Informazione -CNR (Italy) and Computing Center of Humboldt University (Germany).

What is DBUnion?

As a general point, Perl is becoming default-UTF8, so even if it doesn't
look like its UTF8, it may be (the utf8 pragmas are to do with just the
source code, not the data going through the script).

Regards,
Tim.

hi

to clear up any confusion, DBUnion is more or less an OAI aggregrator 
that's used in the ODL project (http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/odl) at Virginia 
Tech.

the original question about utf8 is still unclear to me - i have 
contacted the author to try to resolve this between us.

CIMI News Release: October 15th, 2002
Release of CIMI XML Schema for SPECTRUM and Open Implementers Call for
Alpha Test Period

The CIMI Consortium (www.cimi.org) is pleased to announce the public
release of Version 1.5 of the CIMI XML Schema for SPECTRUM, and the
launch of an Open Implementers call to participate an Alpha Test Period.

The CIMI Schema will enable museums to encode rich descriptive
information relating to museum objects, including associated information
about people, places and events surrounding the history of museum
objects, as well as information about their management and use within
museums. The CIMI Schema will be useful for migrating data, the sharing
of information between applications, and as an interchange format for
OAI (Open Archives Initiative at www.openarchives.org) metadata
harvesting.

The CIMI Schema is based on the SPECTRUM, the data and collections
management standard for museum collections. SPECTRUM was developed by
mda
(www.mda.org.uk) and has been widely implemented in museums
internationally.

The Schema has been tested by CIMI members and data from a variety of
museum databases has been successfully encoded. Implementers from across
the museum and XML communities are now invited to review and/or use the
CIMI Schema in order that it can benefit from real-life use in projects.
This Alpha Test Period will encompass the following stages:

Stage 1	Freezing the CIMI Schema for use during the Alpha Test Period
until
June 2003, in order that implementers can make use of a stable product
and so that CIMI can gather feedback from its use.

Stage 2	After June 2003, CIMI intends to hold at least one Implementers'
Forum to evaluate feedback arising from the use of the CIMI Schema
during its first release and to address issues of how the community can
manage the ongoing extension and refinement of the CIMI Schema in the
future.

Stage 3	Review of the Schema following the Implementers' Forum and
public
release of Version 2 of the Schema in November 2003.

The CIMI Schema and its supporting documentation are available for
download
at: http://www.cimi.org/wg/xml_spectrum/index.html.

Further information about the CIMI XML Schema for SPECTRUM and its
development is available at
http://www.cimi.org/wg/xml_spectrum/index.html.

Questions about the CIMI Schema can  be addressed to the CIMI XML
Project Manager, Alice Grant at agrant@alicegrant.com.

Message-ID: <20021028221107.P9083@io.mds.rmit.edu.au>

Hi all,

I had not checked up on my OAI interop site for a while, so thought
I should check. Good thing I did - it was cactus. Looks like I put
the wrong version of the code into the reboot sequence, so it was
using old code with a newer DB structure - and failing on everything.

I have gone through the list and updated lots of entries. I have more
to do (I don't have all the recent entries yet), but manaully reharvested
lots of sites. I thought I would give a summary of my results here
so far in case anyone is interested.

Errors in the following may be my end!

The following sites appear to work:

    aim25, CCSDJeanNicod, CCSDarchiveSIC, CDLCIAS, CDLDERM, CDLTC, CSTC,

Found a few bugs our end too (but I won't report them! :-).
One bug is a spelling error in the log messages ("Idnetify").
The packet was correct, just the error message is misspelt.

Lots more to test, but I want to go home.

Alan

ps: If you want to look up the log records, go to

    http://teratext.com.au:8123/

Select "Collections" then click "Details" for the "OAI" collection.
Then click the "Log" button for the OAI data provider to look at
the log for. Hopefully it makes reasonable sense.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Minor annoyance - what is the official name of an OAI site?
Message-ID: <20021031185530.H19913@io.mds.rmit.edu.au>

Hi,

One minor annoyance (that I think I have reported before) is that the
list of OAI data providers on the www.openarchives.org site does not
list a 'id' for all bases in the XML document returned.

I then started thinking, what was the id attribute? Is it the repository
name, repository identifier, or just some other id that people decided
to type in when registering the repository? (I think its the latter)

So I thought, well OAI 2.0 has the <oaiIdentifier> description stuff now,
so I can go to a site and work out its identifier. The problem is not
everyone supports it. I just went to AIM25 for example (because
it was alphabetically at the start of the list). It returns a
repository name with spaces

    <repositoryName>AIM25 - Archives in London</repositoryName>

but no repository identifier. Doing a ListRecords showed me the
repository identifier I think is aim25.ac.uk, but I guessed this
as a human by looking at the first record that came back.
Records in a repository should keep the identifier of the original
record in the case of an aggregator, so this is not a reliable
approach to use.

Is it mandatory that all repositories have a 'repository identifier'?

Is it mandatory that Identify for OAI 2.0 make the identifier available?

Should the list on the open archives web site be updated to make sure
it has the correct repository identifiers for all sites?

I know I can go look up the spec, but I am trying to be provocative
here and elicit responses like "no, but it should be" or "don't be silly".
Do aggregators (who just get other people's data) have repository
identifiers even if they don't have any of their "own" content?

I guess my bottom line is that I think the page on the open archives
web site would be better if it included the official repository identifiers
for each registered data provider. I can write a script to generate my
own XML document (get all the URLs, do an Identify - if not good enough,
do a ListRecords).

I guess I am also encouraging people to go to the effort of including
the <oaiIdentifier> description in their OAI data provider implementations
too.

Maybe its just me being pedantic. We have tried to automate the updating
of our list of sites to harvest (for interop testing), but it keeps
getting duplicates.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210310917410.2866-100000@dhcp103-124.cs.cornell.edu>

In the general case, the best identifier for a repository is the <baseURL>
(the <baseURL>, identifier, metadataPrefix and datestamp uniquely identify
a record). I would suggest that you use the baseURL internally and display
the <repositoryName> for human readability.

It is not mandatory that repositories support oai-identifier and it is
thus not mandatory that repositories have a <repositoryIdentifier>. I
think that, if anything, the OAI web site should make information about
repositoryIdenifiers less prominent to avoid this confusion.

In the case of AIM25, they appear to use the oai identifier scheme
(identifiers like oai:aim25.ac.uk:69) but fail to include the appropriate
description block in the Identify response. This is broken. (The
description block should declare aim25.ac.uk to be the
repositoryIdentifier).

The aggregator guidelines say:
"Agents which re-export harvested records should do so with different 
identifiers unless the metadata is unaltered and the original identifier 
corresponds to a recognized URI scheme. It is also recommended that all 
repositories re-exporting harvested records use the repeatable provenance 
containers to provide provenance information."

The case of AIM25 is unclear, it seems that one could decide that the
URI scheme is recognized (it starts with oai:) or not (looks like 
oai-identifier but missing the description).

Dedupping is going to be an interesting problem as the number of OAI
services that re-export metadata grows. Both the use of globally
resolvable identifier schemes and provenance containers will help address
problem.

At the moment, the situation is complicated by the presence of a number of
duplicate data providers for v1.1 and v2.0 listed on the OAI website. This
should be improved when v1.1 repositories are removed from the canonical
data-providers list (scheduled for 1 December 2002:
http://www.openarchives.org/news/oaiv2press020614.html).

I hope that the central registry of OAI sites will become less important
over time. I hope that the "friends" container
(http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-friends.htm) will be used
to create a decentralized web allowing repository discovery.

Cheers,
Simeon

Hi all. I wanted to announce to this list an addition to the metadata
formats available for harvest from the OAI-PMH 2.0 data provider at the
Library of Congress ( http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/oai2_0?verb=Identify
). The newly available format is called Metadata Object Description
Schema or MODS. More information about the format can be found on the
Library's MODS web site at http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/. This
addition will be announced soon on the oai-general list, but if anyone
wants to give this a try, I'd appreciate hearing about any problems.

Use metadataPrefix=mods to harvest this format.

Thanks,

OAIster is a service provider using the OAI protocol to harvest 
repositories of digital object records and make them available to 
end-users. Currently, we are serving close to a million records from 
over 100 repositories. The number of records we have been harvesting 
has more than tripled since our launch at the end of June, and we 
expect it to continue to increase as the usage of OAI becomes more and 
more popular.

Please pass this information along to anyone you think would be 
interested. We welcome any comments and concerns you have about OAIster 
-- your help makes this service better.
