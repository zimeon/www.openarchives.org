Hello,
 
I have a question. I want to implement a harvester into my institucion.
Where can i find the framework for it? 
and... where can i find more information about the rules for this?

I suggest you start by looking at the tools listed at
http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html

There are some technical guidelines for harvesters at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-harvester.htm

Cheers,
Simeon

We haven't advertised this lately, but for anyone operating in a Windows 
environment, we have some code libraries for developing OAI harvesters. 
  The compiled versions and source code are available at:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47963&package_id=46165&release_id=314300

Included with these packages are a couple command line OAI harvesters. 
We have been using and enhancing the reap harvester for a couple years, 
and it is pretty full featured and stable.

Kind regards,
	Tom habing

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.2.20050718173010.023746d8@express.cites.uiuc.edu>

(cross posted to dc-collections)

Over the past year representatives of the Digital Library Federation (DLF) 
and the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) have been working on 
developing best practices for implementations of Open Archives Initiative 
(OAI) data providers as well as for 'shareable' metadata.

This group has found that the issue of set descriptions has been an area 
where the implementer guidelines are not well fleshed out and where current 
practices are inconsistent and often do not meet service provider needs. 
There is also some confusion about what should be included in a set 
description: a description of the collection of metadata in a set, a 
description of the collection of resources referenced by the metadata in 
the set, or some combination of both?

We believe there needs to be:

1)	a clarification of the difference between a description of an OAI set 
and a description of a collection of resources;
2)	an application profile to specifically describe an OAI set; and
3)	a recommendation on the mechanism to convey both a set description and 
collection description, if applicable.

We have prepared a discussion paper which explores these issues and 
proposes a draft of a possible application profile for an OAI set. This is 
available at: 
http://comm.nsdl.org/download.php/624/set-description_ver6.pdf (pdf file). 
We are actively seeking comments and feedback and welcome anyone who might 
want to participate in the further development of this work. Please contact 
Muriel Foulonneau (mfoulonn@uiuc.edu) and Sarah Shreeves 
(sshreeve@uiuc.edu) with comments, questions, and feedback.

Many thanks to the members of the DLF/NSDL OAI Best Practices group who 
have commented already on this draft...

Hello,

I read the document called "Describing OAI sets : a discussion paper" posted 
here by Sarah L. Shreeves and Muriel Foulonneau and found it very 
interesting.

I have just one question : is there a mean to specify in what languages the 
set description and the collection description are written ? If not, I think 
it could be useful, when a data provider wants to provide descriptions in 
multiple languages.

The xml:lang attribute may be used for instance in the <dc:title>, 
<dc:rights> and <dct:abstract> elements.

If I'm not wrong, the Library of Congress provides a set description both in 
english and in russian, using two different <dc:description> distinguished 
by the xml:lang attribute. (see 
http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/oai2_0?verb=ListSets the setspec is "prok").

Hi Frederic,

The schemas we intended to use (formats currently advised by the OAI
implementation guidelines) are derived from the Dublin Core Schema(s) and
allow the xml:lang attribute (not used enough ...).

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Complex objects/embedded metadata/multiple
	schemas
Message-ID: <19ADCC0B9D4CAD4582BB9900BBCE357401945948@tayexc13.americas.cpqcorp.net>

Hi all,

This issue has been skirted in a few previous mails.  Right now, DSpace
can expose metadata about complex objects via its OAI-PMH data provider
interface, either as MPEG-21 DIDL or METS.

One problem of course is that since METS is essentially an envelope for
other kinds of metadata, it's pretty pointless to just say "I support
METS".  It's one step further than "I support XML" but to get
interoperability you need to go quite a bit further.

In other words, as an OAI-PMH service provider (or a tool hoping to do
some resource harvesting/mirroring) I can't just ask for the metadata
prefix "mets" and hope to understand what comes out.  E.g. will it have
qualified DC in it, or MODS?

Perhaps, rather than by namespace/schema, I really need to specify by
profile (and in the case of DSpace even that's not likely to be uniform
across the board).  Should I be using a metadataPrefix like
"mets_dspace" or somesuch?  Just using "mets" might be setting an
expectation of interoperability/understandability that just isn't there.
On the other hand, using "mets_dspace" might be removing a possibility
-- if I expose METS which has qualified Dublin Core in it, a harvester
might at least be able to extract and use that, even if it doesn't
understand some of the other metadata embedded in the METS.

Another issue is whether having multiple schemas in harvested records is
going to cause a problem for harvesters.  Even in the simple case of
METS with some qualified DC in it, there's the METS and QDC schemas.  I
don't have enough experience on the harvester/service provider side of
things to know whether this will cause headaches.

Is this pushing really beyond what OAI-PMH was designed for?

All thoughts/comments welcomed...

Subject: [OAI-implementers] examples needed for OAI Best Practices Shareable
	Metadata
Message-ID: <42E6D0A2.2060909@usc.edu>

Greetings:

The OAI Best Practices Committee is finishing up the Shareable Metadata 
section.  As part of that, we (ok, "I") am searching for the following 
examples, but I've had no luck searching through registered DPs.

I'm hoping that "someone" on the Implementers list can point to an 
example metadata record (or two) for the following:  :-)

(1) An example of, "Linking", and,
(2) An example of, "Clustering"

for (from): 
http://oai-best.comm.nsdl.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DigitalTactileResource


and:


(3) [An example of] <dc:alternative> in a Qualified DC record
(4) [An example of a case] where there is no original title for a work,
(5) [An example of] using a metadata standard/format that does not allow 
for specification of sub-title
(6) [An example of] multiple titles...coded in separate fields.

for (from):  http://oai-best.comm.nsdl.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TitlePractices



I'll keep searching for the above examples, but would appreciate any 
pointers.  I've hit many dead ends, so far.

Thanks in advance,

Jewel
