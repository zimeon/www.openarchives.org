</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, this being a Science Foundation, where the service is to be
</I>&gt;<i> used by the research projects being supported, the idea of having a
</I>&gt;<i> built-in OAI compliant data provider came up a couple of days

</I>&gt;<i> and fill out the corresponding OAI meta-data for each
</I>&gt;<i> publication. Then the server could either just make available all the
</I>&gt;<i> meta-data of all projects in an OAI compliant way or it could also
</I>&gt;<i> provide a unified vision of the whole digital library, including
</I>&gt;<i> comprehensive searches, comprehensive browsing etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, my question is this: does anyone know of some existing software
</I>&gt;<i> for the Zope and/or Plone platforms which could either implement or at
</I>&gt;<i> least facilitate our implementation of these ideas?
</I>
&gt;<i> Is there an OAI compliant data provider (like eprints or Dspace or
</I>&gt;<i> CDSware) implemented on top of Zope or Plone?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would appreciate any information you might have to help us.

</I>&gt;<i> I just want to add that all the software involved in the project is

I'm not sure if this will be of use to you, because it is not an OAI 
data provider per se, but I am currently working on an OAI harvester in 
Zope/Silva for a customer of ours, the Erasmus University of Rotterdam, 
(Silva is an open source content management system, developed by Infrae, 
for which I work.) The harvester itself can collect all (or only 
selected) data from any number of OAI servers, and is independent of 
Silva. A Silva layer is used to present the harvested data in a 
user-friendly way, but I think it shouldn't be that hard to write your 
own presentation layer in vanilla Zope or something like Plone. This 
would help you to get existing OAI-data into your Zope-site, but would 
not be of use to you if you wanted to have a real OAI-Data provider 
written in Zope. Building that would not be that hard either, but I 
don't think it's on our short term to-do list. (It could be put there of 
course ;) The OAI-Harvester code will be released as open source, once 
it is in a stable and usable state, at the latest before September. If 
you (or anyone else) is interested in learning more, or having a look at 
the code while it is in a somewhat less stable state, contact me.
