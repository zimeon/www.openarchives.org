Subject: [OAI-implementers] Metadata Formats
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0110041656550.27353-100000@quake.dpc.ucar.edu>

I am implementing an OAI provider for a digital library project that will
eventually house and serve several different metadata formats. We would
like our collaborators to be able to request a listing of identifiers of
records that are available in a given format (not all records will be
available in all formats).

Currently it appears there is no direct way to make such a query using the
protocol (ie there is no option to include the metadataPrefix argument in
the ListRecords request). One cumbersome solution might be to make a
GetRecords request, then parse out only the identifiers from the return.

Can anyone recommend another solution? Is there a possiblity the option to
include the metadataPrefix argument in a ListRecords request might be
included in future iterations of the protocol?

I assume in the above you mean ListIdentifiers when you say ListRecords.
You are correct that there is no way to get a ListIdentifiers request
to return identifiers of records available in a particular metadata
format.

I think that with the current (v1.1) protocol your suggestion of
doing a ListRecords request (which I assume is what you mean by
GetRecords) with the required metadataPrefix and then discarding
all but the identifiers is the easiest way to accomplish what you
want.

Regarding the question of whether this facility should be added to the
protocol, I'm curious to know why you want to be harvest this subset
of available identifiers without also harvesting the metadata. If
this is a community specific situation then it might perhaps be best for
you and your collaborators to define sets corresponding to the
metadataFormats and then doing ListIdentifiers requests qualified by a
setSpec.

Cheers,
Simeon.

Using the setSpec is a good suggestion. We've envisioned using the setSpec
to denote each sub-collection where the setSpec hierarchy would be used to
describe sub-collection-specific attributes as opposed to metadataFormats.
If two separate sub-collections are available in the same metadataFormat
but are otherwise unrelated, one could certainly construct another set of
setSpecs to describe this relationship, however this muddies the semantics
of the setSpec.

Another way to look at it is from the harvesters point of view. If I know
I can only handle metatadataFormat oai_dc, and I'm interested in updating
my list of id's against yours, it would be nice to simply request a list
of identifiers of metadataPrefix=oai_dc.

We envision using ListIdentifiers as a way to synch metadata in the case
where records have been deleted. For example, if a record has been
deleted, a call to ListRecords&from=2001-09-17&metadataPrefix=oai_dc is
not guaranteed to reveal this deletion, and this would be the common daily
or weekly harvesting done by our collaborators. In such a case it's
necessary to make a call to ListIdentifiers in order to detect deleted
records in the harvested collection.

Using the setSpec for this is a good suggestion however and it certainly
beats having to use the GetRecords request when all you need are the ids.

Many thanks,

 - John

as far as i read the protocol, this is not the case ... each top-level 
"record" tag may have a "status" attribute just like the "identifier" 
tag for ListIdentifiers (see the first example under ListRecords in the 
protocol spec)

Subject: [OAI-implementers] requirement for oai_dc
Message-ID: <20011009231431.A7071@wotan.liu.edu>

  You may be aware that all records available through an
  OAI compliant interface are required to be  available in the 
  oai_dc metadata format. 

  It has been pointed out that, since all elements in oai_dc are
  optional, this requirement does not imply that oai_dc metadata
  has to be available. The oai_dc record can be empty. 

  Independently of that observation, the oai_dc requirement is currently 
  under review by the OAI technical committee. It is alleged that out there
  there are communities that wish to share metadata about 

  (1) item that have no semantically valid oai_dc representation. This is for
      example the case when there are personal data being exposed. 

  (2) items where the creation of an oai_dc record would require stretching
      DC semantics beyond what it is actually meant to be doing. 

  I am in charge of preparing a review on this subject. To inform
  my review, I would be interested to have your opinion. Please 
  let me know if your community has a requirement under (1) or
  if you feel that the oai_dc data that you are already providing
  has questionable semantics, as alluded to in (2). 

  If you think that the requirement for oai_dc is fundamental 
  to your work, please let me know that too. 

  Please respond to me personally, I will summarize the state
  of the question later. 


  Cheers,
