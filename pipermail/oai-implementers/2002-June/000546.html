</I>I think I'm about half way to agreeing with you. This approach does 
require a model which includes parallel metadata formats. So it 
would be OK for OAI, which is what we're talking about on this list.

So we could have a metadata format, say oai-cite (that's not a 
good name! - just something to work with). Then you could encode 
the metadata for a journal article something like as follows. I'm just 
considering the metadata for the article itself, not any references it 
may have - but probably a metadata format for those could be 
incorporated. (Doing this quickly, I've not included any schema 
declarations.)

&lt;metadata&gt;
&lt;cite:atitle&gt;Studying E-journal User Behavior Using Log 
Files&lt;/cite:atitle&gt;
&lt;cite:author&gt;Xu,Y&lt;/cite:author&gt;
&lt;cite:author&gt;Apps,A&lt;/cite:author&gt;
&lt;cite:jtitle&gt;Library and Information Science Research&lt;/cite:jtitle&gt;
&lt;cite:volume&gt;22&lt;/cite:volume&gt;
&lt;cite:issue&gt;3&lt;/cite:issue&gt;
&lt;cite:spage&gt;311&lt;/cite:spage&gt;
&lt;cite:year&gt;2000&lt;/cite:year&gt;
&lt;/metadata&gt;

But this is looking very similar to the OpenURL journal article 
metadata, which leads me to wonder if that can be used here as 
well. The main concern is that this is not a referent (or subject of a 
citation link) but rather an identification by citation metadata, 
unless it's seen as an introverted, self-referential link. Maybe this is 
an OpenURL context-object with a referring-entity but no referent?

To go back to the qualified Dublin Core case, from another email:

&gt;<i> &lt;meta name=&quot;DC.Identifier.citation&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> content=&quot;Library and Information Science Research 22(3), 311- 
</I>338 (2000)&quot;&gt;
&gt;<i> In that the entity Library and Information Science Research is 
</I>being introduced that &quot;has a&quot; volume &quot;22&quot; and issue # &quot;3&quot;. 

This is intended to be an &quot;is a&quot; relation where the entire content of 
this string 'is a' citation, and hence identifier of the article. There is 
no intention to say anything about the journal or issue outside of 
that exact citation. I think this is the same as an OpenURL citation 
where the complete set of metadata within the OpenURL identifies 
a particluar article by its citation. In fact, in OpenURL, different sets 
of metadata elements are used for journal articles (ja) and journal 
issues (ji). It is just coincidence that some of the constituents look 
the same to human readers. 

The document 'Guidelines for implementing Dublin Core in XML' 
<A HREF="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dc-xml-guidelines/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/dc-xml-guidelines/</A> includes 
examples of mixing DC metadata within other schemas. So I think 
one could include OpenURL jounal article metadata with a DC 
record (assuming it is alright to use the OpenURL journal article 
schema stand-alone).

For example:

&lt;metadata&gt;
&lt;dc:title&gt;Studying E-journal User Behavior Using Log 
Files&lt;/dc:title&gt;
&lt;dc:creator&gt;Xu,Y&lt;/dc:creator&gt;
&lt;dc:creator&gt;Apps,A&lt;/dc:creator&gt;
&lt;dcterms:created&gt;2000&lt;/dcterms:created&gt;
&lt;ja:jtitle&gt;Library and Information Science Research&lt;/ja:jtitle&gt;
&lt;ja:volume&gt;22&lt;/ja:volume&gt;
&lt;ja:issue&gt;3&lt;/ja:issue&gt;
&lt;ja:spage&gt;311&lt;/ja:spage&gt;
&lt;/metadata&gt;

Best wishes,
	Ann
