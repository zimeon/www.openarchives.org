<PRE>hi Jean-Yves,

I have a few comments:

* The Library of Congress recently released an XML Schema for MARC21 records, which could be used in stead of
oai_marc.  As the Library of Congress definitely has more authorithy than the OAI when it comes to MARC
records, I would say that usage of their format is preferred from now on.  The LoC recognized that we did not
have an alternative in the OAI-world but to create our own schema before they released theirs, and as a
result they have been so kind to provide an XSLT to migrate records from oai_marc to LoC MARC21 XML format.
see <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-marcxml.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-marcxml.htm</A>

* The approach you have taken is the &quot;all-in-one&quot; as opposed to the &quot;parallel&quot; approach we have been
discussing on this list.  In doing so, some non-standard MARC stuff has been done.  As far as I can tell,
nothing in what you have done will prevent you from adhering to a &quot;parallel&quot; approach once a guideline for
such would be released, because the core of your work is the parsing out of individual information-entities
and tagging them appropriately. Using the markup that you currently have, it should be posibble to convert to
a &quot;parallel&quot; format of the kind I suggested.  As a matter of fact, if you would be interested, I am very
willing to explore this path with you.  Please feel free to contact me directly for further discussion.

greetings

herbert

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree entirely with your suggestion about using OpenURL as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parallel metadata format.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, as the question which started this was about qualified
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DC, I would like to point out that there may be some confusion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about the meaning of 'citation', especially about the DC-Citation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stuff, which has also been referred to as connected with OpenURL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by the Ariadne paper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (<A HREF="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue27/metadata/">http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue27/metadata/</A>). A confusion which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably wasn't helped by my earlier email.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The term 'citation' is used to describe 2 similar but different things.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is easiest to desribe this for journal articles.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. The bibliographic citation information (journal, issue, pagination)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for an article as part of the metadata for the article itself. This is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what publishers refer to as the header information for the article.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. The citation information for papers cited by an article which are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; listed in the references section of the article.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The DC-Citation work is, so far, about (1). Maybe the choice of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; term 'citation' was unfortunate, because everyone assumes it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means (2), but it's difficult to think of a better word. This is why the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encoding suggested for dc-citation is within a dc:identifier element,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because of the recognition that the bibliographic citation can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effectively identify the article. [This could obviously be extrapolated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to (2) but would be within a dc:relation/dcterms:references element.]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The scenario you describe is for citation (2). Here the parallel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; metadata format within a context object you describe looks perfect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is obviously a major OAI requirement, for initiatives such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Citebase.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I think that citation (1) will also be needed as OAI is used for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more than just eprints repositories. For instance, if you wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide OAI records from an A+I database, or a journal article table
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of contents database, you would need to be able to detail the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; journal/issue information within each record. I could see this being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of use for harvesting records for the latest journal issues available
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in such a service. I think you can still use the OpenURL metadata
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for this but that it would be 'nested' within the DC record, similar to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the noddy example I previously wrote. At the moment we're still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stuck with using unrecognised DC structured values in literal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; strings within simple DC to pass this information around.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But at present, I think that the OAI priority is citations(2), and this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current development looks really promising. Citations(1) will need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more discussion within DC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Best wishes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       Ann

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;7F00,0000,0000&lt;/param&gt;&gt; 1. In the context of the OAI-PMH, it would make a lot of sense to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; treat citations as a parallel metadata format.  The unqualified DC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; record describes the &quot;paper&quot;, whereas another record (under the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; item) describes all the citations made in the &quot;paper&quot;.  That is what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Carl suggested in his mail.  And that is the approach that Stevan
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Harnad and I discussed at last year's OAI-related conference in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Geneva.  This approach makes sense in that it is extensible: it allows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; other stuff related to the &quot;paper&quot; (for instance usage logs,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; certification metadata, preservation metadata, etc.) to be treated in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; yet other parallel records under the same item.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2. When it comes to choosing a &quot;metadata format&quot; to describe those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; citations, looking at OpenURL makes a lot of sense.  Not only because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it is becoming a standard, but because its purpose really IS to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; describe stuff (read &quot;citations&quot; in this context) by building on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; broad range of identifier-namespaces and a multitude of metadata
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; formats.  Moreover, OpenURL allows not only for the description of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;citation&quot; but (optionally) also of entities that make up the context
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in which the &quot;citation&quot; appears.  That is very significant when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; thinking about the possibility of open linking at the level of OAI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; service providers. And it is significant when thinking of using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;OpenURL&quot; as a parallel metadata format, as it allows the citation to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; remain attached to the thing in which it is cited.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;/color&gt;[...]
