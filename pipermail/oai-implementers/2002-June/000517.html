<PRE>Stuart,

Indeed there is not yet a xml schema for qualified DC.  Encouraged by the success of (finally) producing a schema for unqualified Dublin Core (the one referenced in the OAI-PMH v2 specification at <A HREF="http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/simpledc20020312.xsd">http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/simpledc20020312.xsd</A>) a number of us in the DC and OAI community are in the midst of producing such a schema.  The timetable is for a solid proposal middle of next month with closure on the process by October.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] XSD file for qualified DC


Maybe I missed it but where can I find the XSD for qualified DC?

There are several websites that have XSDs for DC in RDF etc. but they
mostly say they are beta versions.

If there is not one yet, who would be the right person to convince to do
it?  I have thought of trying myself...but as I am new I don't want to
tread on anyones toes (as it were).
