Hi Susanna,

Early discussions of the oai-rights group led us to conclude that the work
could sensibly be split in two: rights about metadata (OAI-PMH records)
and rights about resources (things OAI-PMH records are about). We took the
easier half first and developed the current beta specification for
conveying rights expressions about metadata.

We intend to continue this work to develop guidelines for conveying rights
about resources within the OAI-PMH framework. Note that it is not clear
that this requires extensions to the protocol. For example, the technique
of using an additional metadata format, for say ODRL or CC, fits well
within the current model and protocol (it is just another set of metadata
about the resource). However, there are important issues with unambiguous
identification of the resource, profiling and such.

Cheers,
Simeon

Subject: [OAI-implementers] TRES NUEVOS PROGRAMAS:
Message-ID: <028201c4d968$6c10e810$0e00000a@pcjulieta>

TRES NUEVOS PROGRAMAS:

e-Librorevistas  + e-Librotesis + IAP impresi?n a pedido

 

Programa de tesis
 

e-Librotesis es un programa elaborado en cooperaci?n con las universidades de Am?rica Latina, Espa?a y Portugal actualmente conectadas a la plataforma e-Libroebrary. Se pretende que sea el recept?culo de ese c?mulo de trabajos de investigaci?n que permanecen est?ticos en los anaqueles de las bibliotecas, y, adem?s, la soluci?n para los autores que enfrentan serias dificultades para editar, publicar e imprimir su trabajo de tesis.

Autores y universidades recibir?n trimestralmente el pago de derechos, y tendr?n asegurada, como cualquier libro de las colecciones de e-Libro, la protecci?n contra la reproducci?n ilegal mediante la aplicaci?n del DRM (Digital Right Managment).

 

Sistema IAP ("impresi?n a pedido")

 

Tanto los autores como las universidades tendr?n a su disposici?n, al margen de las novedosas herramientas de aprendizaje InfoToolsT y las colecciones de e-LibroT, a las que tendr?n acceso, la posibilidad de imprimir ejemplares gracias a nuestro novedoso sistema IAP ("impreso a pedido" o Book on Demand), cuyo software de ?ltima generaci?n permite hacer tirajes m?nimos (12 ejemplares, por ejemplo) a un precio similar al de una impresi?n tradicional en off-set, la que, a diferencia de aqu?lla, exige hacer un elevado desembolso. Para tal efecto, las tesis se publicar?n tambi?n en www.e-libro.net, nuestro sitio hermano.

Programa de Revistas Cient?ficas

 

El programa e-Librorevistas aglutinar? selectas revistas acad?micas, para ponerlas al alcance de los investigadores y los estudiantes usuarios de la plataforma e-Libroebrary. Ser?, asimismo, una excelente oportunidad para las publicaciones peri?dicas con problemas de distribuci?n o peque?os tirajes.

Para llevar adelante este ambicioso programa, e-Libro ha creado el Instituto Superior de Investigaci?n (ISI), donde se seleccionar?n las mejores revistas acad?micas de Am?rica Latina, El Caribe, Espa?a y Portugal.

El Proyecto e-Libro para la publicaci?n electr?nica cooperativa en Internet responde a las necesidades de la comunicaci?n cient?fica en los pa?ses en desarrollo, y proporciona una soluci?n eficiente para asegurar la visibilidad y el acceso universal a la literatura en cuesti?n y superar el fen?meno conocido como ciencia perdida.

Este proyecto es el producto de la colaboraci?n de instituciones internacionales relacionadas con la comunicaci?n cient?fica y de editores especializados en el tema.

 

 

Modelo e-LibroT

 

El Modelo e-LibroT supone la concatenaci?n de los siguientes elementos:

- La publicaci?n electr?nica de ediciones completas de revistas cient?ficas, que representa, adem?s de la preservaci?n de las mismas, la organizaci?n de bases de datos bibliogr?ficas, la recuperaci?n de textos por su contenido (enriquecidos din?micamente con enlaces de hipertexto a bases de datos internacionales, usando las InfoToolsT) y la producci?n de indicadores estad?sticos de uso e impacto de la literatura cient?fica.

- Criterios de evaluaci?n basados en los est?ndares internacionales de comunicaci?n cient?fica.

- Fomento y desarrollo de alianzas entre los actores internacionales de la comunicaci?n cient?fica -autores, editores, instituciones cient?ficas y tecnol?gicas, agencias de apoyo, universidades, bibliotecas, centros de informaci?n cient?fica y tecnol?gica, etc.-, con el objetivo de diseminar el conocimiento. El ?xito en el desarrollo de la plataforma e-LibroT de revistas cient?ficas de Am?rica Latina, El Caribe, Espa?a y Portugal en los pr?ximos a?os contribuir? a que la informaci?n cient?fica y tecnol?gica generada localmente quede r?pidamente disponible, lo que incidir? en el aumento de su uso y beneficio en el proceso de toma de decisiones en los diferentes niveles involucrados.

- La poderosa plataforma e-Libroebrary, su potente motor de b?squeda y las InfoToolsT, el software con sofisticadas herramientas de aprendizaje l?deres en su tipo, adem?s de otros novedosos servicios.

- El sistema IAP ("Impreso a Pedido" o Book on Demand), que permite imprimir un m?nimo de 12 ejemplares de una revista, un journal o un libro que se encuentren agotados y por razones de mercado no convenga reimprimir por los medios tradicionales.

- Versatilidad para su utilizaci?n en las plataformas Linux o Windows.

- Uso de MARC21, lo que permite encontrar el texto desde cualquier biblioteca acad?mica.

 

Criterios de evaluaci?n

 

Si bien el Modelo e-LibroTM tiene definidos desde un principio los criterios de evaluaci?n para la admisi?n y permanencia de t?tulos en las colecciones nacionales y/o regionales, en la medida en que el mismo se extienda a otros pa?ses, se espera un enriquecimiento tal que conlleve a la generalizaci?n progresiva con vistas al establecimiento de criterios ?nicos.

La evaluaci?n emanar? de dos instancias principales: el Instituto Superior de Investigaciones (ISI) y la recomendaci?n que hace la universidad.

El ISI formar? un Consejo Editorial de car?cter p?blico; es decir que estar? integrado por especialistas reconocidos, de origen nacional e internacional. Se invitar? a participar en ?l a prestigiosos centros de investigaci?n, como la UNESCO, las universidades que ya son usuarias de e-Libro, la AICD de la OEA, con el prop?sito de que recomienden y avalen los contenidos acad?micos a subir.

El Comit? Consultivo estar? formado por representantes de la comunidad acad?mica. Tiene por objetivo, basado en la aplicaci?n de los criterios e-LibroTM, proponer:

 

- El enriquecimiento de los criterios de selecci?n.

- El perfeccionamiento del software InfoToolsT.

 

Los criterios propiamente dichos son b?sicamente los siguientes:

- Revistas incluidas en ?ndices internacionales. Se aceptar?n autom?ticamente aquellas publicaciones nacionales indizadas por instituciones reconocidas, ministerios, universidades y centros de investigaci?n.

- Revistas no incluidas en ?ndices internacionales, para ser consideradas por el Consejo Editorial. Cuando un t?tulo no est? autom?ticamente habilitado para su admisi?n en la colecci?n e-Libro, el mismo deber? ser evaluado por el Consejo Editorial.

- Alcance de las colecciones. Como principio general, dentro de la colecci?n e-Libro cabr?n las revistas cient?ficas que publican predominantemente art?culos resultantes de investigaciones cient?ficas originales y otras contribuciones de la misma ?ndole, que sean significativas para el ?rea espec?fica de la publicaci?n. El proceso de revisi?n y aprobaci?n de las contribuciones deber? ser realizado por especialistas.

Cada t?tulo estar? disponible en la plataforma e-Libroebrary a partir del a?o 2001. Las contribuciones pueden estar escritas en ingl?s (www.ebrary.com), portugu?s (www.e-livro.com) y espa?ol (www.e-libro.com).

hi Joseph

some thoughts ...

on a technical level, it makes sense that if there is to be a new 
version of OAI-PMH it should probably be layered over a (RESTful) SOAP.

on a practical level, there is a lot of existing community knowledge and 
infrastructure built around OAI-PMHv2.0 so we dont want to disturb that 
without enough of a reason.

on a political level, to go beyond the controlled experiments some of us 
have done would require the support of the DL community at large.

so, basically, we did the experiments and we know the issues. yes, it 
can work. but, no, im not certain we need to push this just yet. it is 
almost like the planets need to be aligned but they just dont seem to be 
aligned at the moment ... until they are aligned, OAI-PMHv2.0 may be the 
thing to stick to :)

ttfn,
----hussein

Hi Hussein,

Do you think it would be possible to construct a SOAP transport that 
wraps an OAI2 repository?
i.e. SOAP requests get translated into an HTTP query

I'm unsure whether SOAP allows an "ANY" container, which I guess would 
be required to allow metadata XML to transport through a SOAP body?

All the best,
Tim.

If there was consensus for how to do this, I could add SOAP access as a
gateway service to the ERRoL server at http://errol.oclc.org. This would
be easier than trying to retrofit it to all the existing OAI data
providers directly.

hi Jeff, Tim, et al

i agree - consensus is the issue here. there are certainly many 
different ways to encode OAI-ish data into SOAP envelopes. it shouldnt 
be too difficult to set up a process to decide on a single 
interpretation, but that should be within the auspices of the OAI (if it 
still exists) and, more importantly, i think we should put effort into 
it only if people think there is real benefit in doing it right now!

as a counter-argument, the dust on SOAP1.2 has yet to settle and WSDL is 
not yet a W3C recommendation ... alternatively we can adopt the WSI 
interpretation of Web Services, which does not rely on W3C 
standardisation but builds on the technical notes. all very political 
and complicated stuff indeed :)

in any event, if the technical stuff isnt a big deal then the pertinent 
question is: how do users (people who code their own data providers and 
harvesters) feel? is there a need to look at SOAPifying OAI-PMH at this 
point in time?

ttfn,
----hussein

ps. yes, Tim, you can easily create a layered SOAP/OAI system (see the 
paper at ECDL2004) ... and, yes, you can include the ANY bit because you 
can really include anything that XML Schema allows ...

For someone who is clearly too dense to get it (and not afraid to admit  
it), and for perhaps others who are in the same boat, could someone  
please describe the practical benefits of SOAP vs. OAI? That is,  
specifically what is enabled by SOAP that you cannot already accomplish  
using OAI? I've scanned the referenced paper for evidence and am still  
wondering. Thanks,

It's not a question of SOAP vs. OAI, it's a question of SOAP vs. REST.
OAI could, in theory, operate using either transport mechanism.
Currently, the OAI protocol is based on the REST model, but some people
prefer the SOAP model (although I can't imagine why. ;-))

In general, REST refers to the use of HTTP URL requests that produce
some form of HTTP response. This approach is so familiar to us with web
browsing that we don't even realize it is a convention for providing
lightweight web service like OAI and RSS.

SOAP, OTOH, generally requires intelligent clients (compared to web
browsers) that can encode requests in SOAP wrappers and decode the SOAP
responses.

Just to clarify:
There is indeed an HTTP based approach of SOAP, it is called "The SOAP 
HTTP Binding". Here is an complete request example from the chapter 
"SOAP HTTP GET Usage" of the W3C SOAP Primer [1].

GET /travelcompany.example.org/reservations?code=FT35ZBQ  HTTP/1.1
Host: travelcompany.example.org
Accept: text/html;q=0.5, application/soap+xml

The answer is in an SOAP envelope, a specific client is needed (as with 
OAI-PMH?).

For example Fedora (Open-Source Digital Repository Management System) is 
using such an approach in the Fedora-API-A-LITE [2].


Regarding the question on advantages of SOAP see the interesting 
discussion threads two years ago on "OAI-PMH & SOAP":
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-January/000294.html
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-February/000305.html

A person of the Inktomi company is speaking for SOAP, see:
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-January/000296.html
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-February/000306.html
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2002-February/000309.html

I think some of his arguments are still important. Here are some 
snippets of his arguments:
"With a SOAP
interface, it would be fairly easy to build a harvester for
our search engine. It would be a very nice sample program for our
indexing interface. But with a one-of-a-kind XML protocol, it isn't
worth the trouble.

I believe that not using SOAP is a serious mistake. It means that
OAI will remain a niche protocol, with few implementations, few
users, and little positive effect.

With SOAP, you get scaling support, test suites, development tools,
supported libraries, directory service, etc. A custom protocol can
never catch up. And implementors have much better things to do
with their time than re-invent RPC."
"I want that library information to be easily available to all,
not just people willing to run a library-only protocol."
"With a SOAP protocol, any scripted web page can make a call to OAI.
Servers like DP9 and the repository explorer become very easy to
write. A professor's list of publications could be built from
the eprint data."
"OAI is already using an XML RPC. Switching from a non-standard XML
RPC to a standard one should be an obvious decision."



As fare as I know: Google is investing in SOAP [3] but not OAI-PMH.

But are we losing track of the fact that OAI-PMH is a _harvesting_  
protocol and NOT a _searching_ protocol? Are potential SOAP users of  
OAI data providers clear that the only thing they may be able to do is  
request 85,000 records in order to get the ten they are really after  
(the "professor's list of publications" example below)? The Google API,  
for example, is searching of course, not harvesting. There is a  
difference.

The Google API is showing, that a big company is investing in SOAP. You 
are right, that the Google API is offered on the searching side. But to 
build an index on OAI resources, a search engine would need the 
possibility to harvest the mentioned 85,000 records. For this purpose a 
search engine would have to invest in OAI-PMH. That is the question: are 
they willing to invest besides of SOAP in the "niche" protocol OAI-PMH?

SOAP isn't by any means all about search interfaces - it's designed to  
be used for any web service.

  Remote search is one important kind of service  
[http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/srw/ ], metadata harvesting is  
another, 'what's the weather' is another, stock prices are another,  
customer contact management is another  
[http://www.sforce.com/resources/api.jsp] , mailing list management is  
another  
[http://www.lyris.com/products/listmanager/beta_news.html?s=sdbr ], the  
NCBI eutilities are another  
[http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/esoap_help.html ]

The fundamental point of SOAP is well expressed in the comment:

>> "With a SOAP

This is precisely the benefit of SOAP - it lowers the amount of 'one of  
a kind' work that an implementor has to do. And as a result it  
*dramatically* increases the chance that people outside the direct  
target area for the OAI protocol will actually use it.

Migrating OAI to use SOAP as its transport does seem long overdue...

Would it not be possible to build a SOAP "adapter" for OAI-PMH, ie, a SOAP
implementation that hid calls to the standard OAI harvesting protocol?
In fact, if I'm not mistaken, Jeff Young just volunteered :) to do so
something very much like that.

as a matter of fact, this is incorrect.  Google has recently been doing
things with the OAI-PMH.  the important thing for Google, as far as I
understand, is getting to content.  if enough content is available through
the OAI-PMH, they will use the OAI-PMH to get to it.  and it seems that
Google has decided that enough interesting content might be (or might
become) available through the OAI-PMH for it be worth their time.

The Google API is showing, that a big company is investing in SOAP. You 
are right, that the Google API is offered on the searching side. But to 
build an index on OAI resources, a search engine would need the 
possibility to harvest the mentioned 85,000 records. For this purpose a 
search engine would have to invest in OAI-PMH. That is the question: are

they willing to invest besides of SOAP in the "niche" protocol OAI-PMH?

I'm not sure it is strictly true that Google needs to invest in OAI-PMH
in order to "index on OAI resources". 

The Googlebot can crawl HTML representations of the metadata records
which are also exposed via OAI-PMH (assuming they are served at
persistent Google-friendly URIs etc) Isn't this exactly what services
like the DP9 gateway enable/provide?

http://dlib.cs.odu.edu/dp9/

As Jeff noted a couple of messages upthread, the issue is not SOAP v
OAI-PMH, or search v harvest, but whether an implementation of OAI-PMH
semantics over SOAP offers anything that is not available using the
current implementation over HTTP GET/POST.

I disagree.

Sure, in functional terms, a SOAP implementation won't offer anything 
that isn't available with the current HTTP/GET implementation.
That's like saying that HTTP isn't worth supporting because it can't do 
anything you can't do with your own ad hoc protocol over TCP/IP.

The reason that HTTP is worth supporting is that there are tools 
(browsers, client libraries, proxies etc) that support it.

And the same is true of SOAP. For better or worse, SOAP is the best 
supported standard for making web services (such as OAI-PMH) available.
And this means that there are high level tools for working with SOAP 
available in  essentially all major programming languages.
This makes writing robust clients and glue to consume the service 
*dramatically* easier. And this in turn will increase uptake of the 
service.

I agree that there are a number of tools that make working with SOAP
convenient in most major programming languages. In Java, for example,
developers can use Apache Axis or Sun's J2EE 1.4 tools to create bindings
at both ends of a SOAP service, and other languages have similar tools
available. In addition, standards are emerging for SOAP that natively
support things like authorization and authentication, integrity and
privacy, etc.

One could argue that REST-full Web services like the OAI-PMH also have a
large number of available tools for working with them.  Developers can
issue REST requests and inspect REST responses in their Web browser;  
Major Web browsers can apply XSLT to render a REST response as HTML
automatically; XML parsers and validators are available in all major
languages that make working with REST responses simple pragmatically; etc.

I believe that this high-accessible nature of the OAI-PMH as a REST-full
service helped contribute to it's widespread adoption. Can anyone name a
SOAP service API that has gained the popularity and breadth of use on both
the producer and consumer ends as that of the OAI-PMH or RSS?

Since the SOAP and REST service approaches offer different advantages, I
think it's not a question of whether the OAI-PMH should convert to using
SOAP but rather whether the OAI should consider developing a SOAP version
of the protocol, similar to the Z39.50 ZING initiative, which offers
something similar to both (SRW and SRU).

yes, but there are a number of problems with this approach, esp. for large
sites.  many web crawlers are biased to go "wide", not "deep", and DP9
produces deep trees that crawlers don't always traverse.

DP9 can also be unkind to repositories; the proxy between the robot and
the repository obscures any throttling the repository does.

DP9 is a neat trick, but it is not a complete solution.

I tried to come up with a harvesting-based mechanism to work around the
limitations of DP9 for the DSpace community.  Rather than work
interactively with a repository like DP9, I harvest the repositories and
create a set-based hierarchy of static HTML pages that I then expose to
search engines. You can see the prototype at
http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/DSpace/. This produces a bushier than
DP9 making it easier for Google et al to crawl in its entirety.

I think, OAI has done the right thing (OAI-PMH is based on the REST 
model) at the right time (in a time when SOAP was not well established). 
This approach was probably one of the reasons of the large success of 
OAI-PMH.

It seems to me, that now - when SOAP is well established - a migration 
of OAI to SOAP is advicable. This would give the chance to use SOAP 
tools and to open OAI for other purposes. As fare as I know, OAI-PMH is 
mainly used for metadata on publications (i.e. Dublin Core based).

I am interested to have a protocol for harvesting and also for specific 
retrieval of one record or only a part of this record. My background is 
metadata of social science data (DDI - Data Documentation Initiative). 
This standard has ca. 300 elements and the DDI documents could grow 
large. On "requesting a part of a record" see an older discussion thread:
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-implementers/2004-January/001137.html

I wouldn't want this to happen. It means suddenly harvesters will need 
to support SOAP (RESTful SOAP seems to be an oxymoron). This is a much 
heaviever burden for implementors; right now you only need XML 
processing libraries and URL capabilities, not full SOAP support. 
Debuggability with SOAP would also go down a lot.

I'd rather have the protocol evolve into a more RESTish direction 
myself, starting by the putting all verbs behind different URLs. Then 
you can have a single entry point url which delivers a bit of XML 
describing where all the other verb URLs are. It's probably also 
possible to RESTify things a bit more concerning the individual items, 
giving them each a separate URL.

I've implemented a Python-based OAI-PMH harvester, and having to work

I disagree that it'd be dramatically easier. I think it's overestimating 
the complexity of OAI-PMH, and underestimating the complexity of SOAP.

If I had to implement the oaiphm.py module using SOAP I'd have to find 
an up to date, functional SOAP implementation in Python. Is there one 
there that's kept up to date? I've heard mixed reports. XML parsers and 
http libraries are however available everywhere.

Debugging in case something went wrong would've been a lot harder, due 
to the added layers. Performance would quite possibly also go down, due 
to the added layers. I'd need to learn SOAP *and* the OAI-PMH model; now 
I just needed to learn the OAI-PMH model.

I've heard Python/XML people say SOAP is past the hill concerning buzz, 
and that they just don't run into it.

http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5484

This is an analysis of what went wrong (and right) with adding SOAP 
support to a Perl based CMS:

Disagreed from one implementer, at least. Having to work with SOAP 
would've made this developer less happy...

Very interesting!

That sounds more like REST, then. OAI-PMH is quite far away along the 
road to REST, though its RESTfulness could still be increased -- 
everything going through the same URL as it does now is not very 
RESTful, for instance.

REST (and REST-like - since neither OAI-PMH nor SRU is strictly REST)
works better when the client developer (or server developer for that
matter), is happy to deal with a chunk of XML and use their favourite
tools (DOM, SAX, XSLT etc.) to handle the XML.

SOAP works better when the WebService is well typed and parameterised,
and the client developer prefers to have a SOAP toolkit generate an API
(so the client developer never sees XML).

Of course in OAI-PMH (just as in SRW/U) the payload is going to be an
XML representation of the metadata so the developer will still have to
cope with XML even in a SOAP implementation.

REST is a lower entry point in terms of complexity (in that you don't
need REST specific tools - as John mentions a browser will do the job).
SOAP needs toolkits, and at present unless you are using C# or Java,
support can be patchy.

REST services tend to be more forgiving of variance/errors in the XML.
SOAP will give an fault if the XML isn't strictly correct. Again this
makes REST easier to implement in the short term, but can cause problems
long term.

REST is (currently) limited to working over XML, HTTP and using a
request/response model. SOAP, however, is not limited to using XML as
the transport encoding (as the programmer never directly works with the
XML directly, it is very easy to support other encodings, and there is
work on binary compact formats for limited bandwidth devices), is not
limited to HTTP as the transport, and is not limited to the
request/response model (indeed the current Axis and .Net SOAP tools
offer SOAP over message queueing systems).

Martijn,

You might want to look at the ERRoL server (http://errol.oclc.org/),
which provides a (somewhat) more RESTful view of (most of) the OAI
repositories registered at UIUC. Details are at
http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/oairesolver/. For example, see the
ERRoL services for the OCLC Office of Research Publications repository
at http://errol.oclc.org/orpubs.oclc.org.html.

It seems better to add this stuff as a layer on top of OAI rather than
muck with the protocol itself.

I should clarify - I wasn't saying that SOAP should or must be the *only*
syntax for expressing OAI requests.
REST has many benefits. A lot of services are  provided with SOAP and REST
interfaces.
And it wouldn't be so difficult to provide a gateway that could support the
legacy OAI  syntax,  to prevent archive implementers from having to rework
all their stuff.

But SOAP does have significant traction (again, I would point to
www.sforce.com as just one example: and note that Salesforce.com is a
company that *seriously* know what it is doing technically).

And SOAP takes care of all kinds of housekeeping issues that everyone has to
roll their own version of, when implementing an OAI-PMH client using raw
http and XML processing.

By the way:
I totally agree with Matt Dovey's points detailing some of the respective
(in many ways complementary) strengths of REST/REST-like approaches vs
SOAP.

This is a very good analysis. A very interesting point you make that I 
hadn't seen before is that due to the nature of OAI-PMH the developer 
will need to work with the metadata-specific XML anyway.

Calling the current approach 'legacy' already worries me; XML over HTTP 
is not legacy just yet. Why not provide a SOAP gateway instead if you 
want to support such legacy SOAP interfaces? :)

I'd say REST has a fair amount of traction as well. The "Architecture of 
the World Wide Web, First Edition" document references and describes it:

http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/

And xml.com this week is full of articles about REST:

http://www.xml.com/

That's the difficulty with frameworks and tools; they offer power but 
also a risk of complexity, which is hard to hide completely. I think 
most of the housekeeping involving OAI-PHM involves resumption tokens; I 
presume SOAP has some mechanism for batching results? (http 1.1 of 
course also implements a way to batch things, though this is probably 
harder to implement on the server side)

Subject: [OAI-implementers] persistent IDs: DOI vs Handle
Message-ID: <41BF871F.4080804@usc.edu>

How did you all decide on which kind of persistent ID to use for your 
digital items?

We at USC are in the midst of implementing our DL as a DP.  The content 
thus far consists of digitized images of (physical) photographs or 
maps.   Other collections to come include born-digital and born-physical 
audio, video, papers, etc., and so on and so forth.  Currently, we have 
122,000 unique items, w/another 50,000 from the "old" DL system to be 
migrated by June 30th 2005.  And more to come after that....

However, we (which really means, "I", as I have to make a 
recommendation) keep getting "stuck" on the persistent identifier 
question, particularly DOI vs Handle.  All items in the USC DL have a 
"unique ID", but we just don't have any persistent IDs assigned.  
Obviously, we can't go farther w/the DP implementation if we haven't 
decided on which type of persistent ID to use.

On the one hand, I see the advantages and disadvantages of going w/the 
Handle system...and on the other hand, the advantages and disadvantages 
of choosing DOI.  At various conferences this Fall, I also received 
advice from many people, some of whom are on this list, that recommended 
one choice over the other, but the advice always contradicted the 
previous advice.  ;-)

I am putting a matrix together to examine both, but...in my frustration, 
I wonder if I shouldn't just toss a coin in the air and which ever side 
it lands on is the one I'll use....

Any thoughts or advice on this process of choosing a persistent ID? 

Or, on the pros and cons of DOI vs the Handle System?

[Btw, I looked at the OAI Best Practices wiki and did not see anything 
listed yet on this issue, so perhaps this advice/discussion can be 
adopted for the wiki.]

Thanks in advance,

Jewel

Hi Jewel,

I suggest that you use an independent (oai:something) identifier system 
in your OAI interface. This will make your OAI items agnostic to any 
persistent identifier scheme you may use for your collection(s). The 
thing to keep in mind is that OAI is a transport - any important data 
(e.g. DOI) should be in your Dublin Core <identifier> fields. This will 
provide you with much more flexibility on how your data may be presented 
by services - e.g. while from a preservation point of view every image 
may need a separate identifier, if you had multiple photos of one event 
it may make more sense for an OAI service to show only one record 
(rather than 100 records, iterating over different angles of view ...).

All the best,
Tim.

Subject: [OAI-implementers] persistent IDs: DOI vs Handle
Message-ID: <5.2.1.1.0.20041216175433.02c27be0@mail.cilea.it>

Hi,

>Any thoughts or advice on this process of choosing a persistent ID?
>Or, on the pros and cons of DOI vs the Handle System?

my 2 cents on the topic.
1) DOI vs Handle is not a real question. DOI is 'only' a particular 
application of Handle. For a sysop Handle and DOI are the same:
-you recive a dump code that need a central server to be resolved
-differences: Handle is free (now, but in the future ? ). For DOI you pay. 
But the 'DOI system' have much option (for example metadata on the central 
server not only in you server as Handle, etc.)

The real confrontation is : Handle/DOI vs OAI-identifier 
<http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-oai-identifier.htm>.

Advantage of OAI-identifier:

-It is free now and for ever
-It is easier for Services Providers retrive metadata with OAI-identifier.
As example you can see ERRoLs 
<http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/oairesolver/default.htm>. This SP 
works better with OAI-identifiers
  than Handles. Remeber that now CrossRef gives free metadata from a DOI 
but in the future ?

Disadvantage of OAI-identifier:
-Data Providers must do more work. It is DP work to keep OAI-identifiers 
persistent
-The key point is: you select a web address (as http://eprints.rclis.org/), 
you need to mantain the same address (or a redirection).

Only my 2 cents.

Let's be clear about the difference between identifiers for resources
and identifiers for metadata about those resources. Handles and PURLs
would be appropriate for the former, OAI identifiers are relevant to the
latter.

Many thanks to all of you who responded both online and offline.

Just some responses to a few of the comments/suggestions.

(1) Yes, I understand that Handle vs DOI is technically a non-issue.  
The issue with this is policy/overall infrastructure/cost, which is, 
IMO, a stickier issue to wade through, hence my asking for advice on 
*how* it was waded thru by others on this list.

(2) I do understand the difference between an OAI-PMH metadata record ID 
and the item ID.  Really.  If I didn't at this point, I think both 
Michael Nelson AND Herbert Van de Sompel would petition UNC-CH to 
nullify/take back my master's degree.  ;-)

The problem is that currently I have a multi-media archive, but will 
eventually integrate into the current archive an Institutional 
Repository (which will contain both multi-media and text-based items).  
For the IR text-based content, I'd prefer to have DOIs.  But the overall 
DOI/Handle is not for multi-media (per the DOI web site) and as I am in 
Los Angeles at a school heavily involved in the movie industry, I can't 
exactly ignore that.  Which means I should look elsewhere than 
Handle/DOI for a persistent ID scheme to cover all objects (which I 
did), or use multiple persistent ID schemas for different formats (which 
sounds like a real pain and I considered for a nanosecond).  I've seen 
use of Handles for multi-media content (LC, DSpace) so in spite of what 
the DOI web site says, in application, it doesn't seem to be a problem.

As one person caught...yes, we have multiple .gifs of different sizes 
for each .tiff image (the .tiff rendition is not available to the 
public) tied to one metadata record with one unique (USC-centric) ID for 
the "unique item" and one unique ID for the metadata record (to be added 
in the OAI DP implementation).   We want to take the USC-centric unique 
ID and make it persistent outside our universe here. :-)

I did seriously look at ARK, also, but...have recommended to my 
colleagues at USC that we go with DOI, and that recommendation has been 
accepted.

Happy Holidays to you all.

Regards,

Jewel

Hi, 

there is a report on PI from a workshop organized by Erpanet in which some of
this issues are discussed.
See:
