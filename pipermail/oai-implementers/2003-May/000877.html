Why not additionally mimic the OAI interface on the SOAP/WSDL level for
harvesting purposes? I.e. the SOAP object could provide methods for RPC 
like
getRecord(), getIdentifiers() with the respective arguments (identifier,
until, ...) passed to them. Calling the remote procedures would return the
respective OAI result.

Has a kind of SOAP-OAI already been implemented somewhere or discussed 
on this
list? In fact, the OAI header corresponds to the SOAP envelope paradigm, 
both
use XML for data transport. SOAP does not only rely on HTTP, but would also
allow for asynchronous harvesting via SMTP.
