<PRE>There is an XML metadata format that strive to be a wrapper for complex
digital objects that may contain content as well as metadata:

METS - Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard  

<A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/</A>

&quot;The METS schema is a standard for encoding descriptive, administrative,
and structural metadata regarding objects within a digital library,
expressed using the XML schema language of the World Wide Web
Consortium. The standard is maintained in the Network Development and
MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress, and is being developed
as an initiative of the Digital Library Federation.&quot;


I believe METS could be used as a metadata format within OAI.


Another thing to take a look at is the Fedora project:

<A HREF="http://www.fedora.info/index.shtml">http://www.fedora.info/index.shtml</A>

&quot;The new system demonstrates how distributed digital library
architecture can be deployed using web-based technologies, including XML
and Web services and is designed to be a foundation upon which
interoperable web-based digital libraries can be built.&quot;

This isn't OAI, but is XML, web, WSDL, etc.

Hi

Marks question seems to come up fairly often - i.e how do I encapsulate
content with my metadata?

I have so far assumed that pointers (URLs probably) would be imbedded in
the metadata and the harvesting system has to have a method (apart from
OAI) to simply pickup all the referenced files by the pointers in the
metadata.

We are moving forward with our OAI efforts and will probably need images
to be able to 'harvested' (at a minimum a thumbnail probably).

Any list users have experience with this generally? or in the museum
context explicity?
