Herbert,
thanks for the email.  Yes, I completely agree with this analysis.  The
proposal is a bit of a hack, and we should perhaps have made this clearer
in the document!

However, I think it is a useful hack :-).  Particularly so in the context
of our other recommendations for using simple DC to describe eprints.
Furthermore, I would see it as good practice to embed XHTML &lt;link&gt;
elements into jump-off pages anyway - irrespective of whether the
intention is to ease harvesting by robots or not.  So I certainly don't
see our proposal as causing any harm.

The rest of your email raises some quite significant issues - some of
which I suspect are not very easy to discuss by email.  I don't propose
giving a detailed response here, but I would like to note a few issues for
consideration...

Firstly, your comments about the complexity of the objects being described
only goes part-way to describing the problem.  The OAI-PMH specification,
rightly, says very little about the nature of the resources that are
described by the records exchanged using the protocol.  However,
particular applications of the protocol do need to be clear about the
nature of the resources being described.  Furthermore, the complexity of
the problem is not just about whether the resources being described are
aggregations of multiple objects.  Part of the complexity arises because
those those resources/objects fit into a model of the real world that
spans both 'conceptual' works and specific digital or physical
'manifestations' of those conceptual works.

Does the oai_dc record that I allow you to harvest describe a conceptual
work (or expression of a work), an article for example, or does it
describe one of the particular manifestations of that work, the PDF copy
of the article for example?

You'll note that I am intentionally using terms from the IFLA FRBR
(Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) model here.

In our guidelines for using simple DC to describe eprints we made the
explicit decision to reflect the fact that most implementations of eprint
archives (that we looked at) appeared to be configured to expose oai_dc
metadata about the 'work' rather than about the particular manifestations
of the work (though actually, in many cases (even in our own guidelines
to a certain extent) there is a certain amount of fuzziness going on!).

Unfortunately, there is no real way of indicating in a simple DC record
that the work (as opposed to the manifestation) is being described - this
would be difficult even in qualified DC currently, because the current
DCMI Type vocabulary doesn't allow us to make those distinctions.  But, in
principle, the DC model is rich enough to handle this complexity - if
we are prepared to put the effort in to agree how to do it.

But the situation is even more complex than that because it is not clear
to me where OAI resources and records sit within the Web architectural
model of 'resources' and 'representations'.  My suspicion is that the FRBR
'manifestation' is the equivalent of the Web architecture
'represresentation' of the FRBR 'work' (if you see what I mean!).  The
oai_dc record (and indeed the jump-off page) is a 'representation' of
the 'work' (assuming that is what is being described).  But at this point
we almost certainly need a diagram or two! :-(

OK, so on then to the question about whether the protocol can and/or
should be used to exchange 'resources' as well as 'metadata' about
'resources'.

The protocol spec is very explicit in differentiating 'resources' from
'items' and 'records' and makes it very clear that the protocol be used to
exchange 'metadata' between services - I'm thinking of section 2.2 in
particular.  Now, with hindsight, I really wish we'd talked instead about
'resources' and 'representations' rather than resources, items, records
and metadata, because that would have given us much more flexibility about
what we do with the protocol.  But we didn't - and therefore, I think we
are constrained in terms of what we can do within the semantics of the
protocol spec.

This is not just to do with the words being used in the spec.  It has to
do with the entities in the model used by the protocol and the identifiers
that are assigned to those entities.  An oai-identifier, for exanmple, is
an identifier of an 'item', not of a 'resource' (in terms of the protocol
usage of those words).  It seems to me that things are likely to become
very fuzzy if the 'item' or 'record' suddenly becomes the 'resource' and
vice versa.

So, based on this, it seems to me that the protocol will 'break' if we
start using it to carry the 'resource' where the protocol expects to see
the 'record about the resource'.

Now, your complex example of the METS package or the MPEG-21 DIDL is an
interesting case - because those things can be used to carry both the
metadata and the object.  Is a METS package the 'resource' or the 'record'
in OAI terms?  The answer is that it is somewhere in-between.  I certainly
accept that the METS package is a 'representation' of a 'resource' - but,
as I mentioned above, unfortunately we didn't use the words 'resource' and
'representation' in the protocol spec.  Yes, the complex package can be
viewed as metadata - but metadata about what - about the 'work' that the
objects in the package 'represent', or about the particular manifestations
contained in the package??!

All in all, I think I'm happy with the case where OAI is used to carry the
METS or DIDL package that contain objects - but I would be much less happy
with a situation where the OAI-PMH is used to carry individual
manifestations (an XHTML document for example).  But the fuzziness between
the package and the item worries me and I'm not sure that we are going to
be able to tell them apart very easily in all cases.

Enough for now...  I agree with you that much more discussion and thinking
about these issues is required.  I'm certainly happy (and indeed
expecting) to be told I'm wrong about any or all of the above! :-)

Regards,

Andy.

&gt;<i> * The scenario as described in the propsoal, in which a single metadata record
</I>&gt;<i> corresponds with a single &quot;preprint&quot; is only a special case of - future -
</I>&gt;<i> reality.  Increasingly, objects held in and described by repositories will be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;compound&quot; or &quot;complex&quot;, i.e. consisting of multiple datastreams, not just a
</I>&gt;<i> single &quot;preprint&quot;.  I find that it would be desirable that a solution to get to
</I>&gt;<i> the content would be able to handle such situations.  The proposed solution
</I>&gt;<i> could actually accomodate such 'compound' objects, because the mutliple
</I>&gt;<i> datastreams are linked off the jump-off page.  There is, however, a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Let's presume we have a situation in which an object is deposited in an
</I>&gt;<i> institutional repository that has 2 datastreams, each of which actually has a
</I>&gt;<i> unique identifier, say a doi or something.  Thinking of a - future -
</I>&gt;<i> self-archiving scenario and the trend to accord identifiers at finer levels of
</I>&gt;<i> granularity, this is not unlikely at all.  Now we get 3 things in dc.identifier
</I>&gt;<i> (2 doi's and a link to a jump-off page), and 2 things in the jump-off page
</I>&gt;<i> (links to the 2 datastreams).  How do I know which doi goes with which
</I>&gt;<i> datastream?  Information that - I hope we will all agree - is rather significant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  The point I am trying to make is that the described scenario and its more
</I>&gt;<i> general problem domain (beyond eprints, and into the realm of objects with
</I>&gt;<i> multiple datastreams) may call for another approach.  Our research has shown
</I>&gt;<i> that such an approach can remain 100% OAI-PMH-based if a complex object format
</I>&gt;<i> such as METS, MPEG-21 DIDL or SCORM is used.  These formats can be &quot;parallel&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> OAI-PMH &quot;metadata formats&quot; through which harvesters can get to the content
</I>&gt;<i> without running into issues such as the ones mentioned above.  Content can be
</I>&gt;<i> embedded in the XML wrappers or pointed at by them.  Identifiers can be
</I>&gt;<i> unambiguously connected to content.  If content changes, the datstamp of the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;conplex&quot; record changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I anticipate concerns re the overhead of introducing a solution based on a
</I>&gt;<i> complex object format.  At this point, I would like to say 2 things with this
</I>&gt;<i> respect:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * It took 2 people on my team about 2 days to create a prototype plug-in that
</I>&gt;<i> enables OAI-PMH harvesting of content from DSpace repositories.  Our plug-in
</I>&gt;<i> rendered content using the MPEG-21 DIDL XML wrapper format.  Most of the time
</I>&gt;<i> invested in this plug-in was spent figuring out the DSpace API and a sensible
</I>&gt;<i> way to map the DSpace data model to the DIDL data model.  The prototype was
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrated at the DSpace federation meeting, last week.  Although
</I>&gt;<i> questions/issues did arise in the course of our work, non seemed unsolvable.
</I>&gt;<i> But it is my impression that the very fast delivery of a prototype indicates the
</I>&gt;<i> feasibility of the complex format approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I would personally be very willing to spend time with the apporpiate
</I>&gt;<i> representatives of the community - including yourself - to work towards a
</I>&gt;<i> solution that is future-proof and provides adequate guarantees regarding
</I>&gt;<i> perceived requirements of a content-harvesting solution.  I would actually
</I>&gt;<i> prefer that over going for a solution which is attractive at first glance
</I>&gt;<i> because of its obvious simplicity, but which seems to raise some relevant
</I>&gt;<i> questions upon closer inspection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To end, I would like to thank you for bringing this topic to the list.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> had many private email exchanges over the last few months especially with
</I>&gt;<i> representatives from DARE and DINI about this and related problem domains.  I
</I>&gt;<i> hope that your mail can be another impulse towards a joint action in this realm.
</I>&gt;<i>   The problem is very real, and I would love our community to jointly create a
</I>&gt;<i> really good solution to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> many greetings
