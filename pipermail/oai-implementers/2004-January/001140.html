<PRE>hi Joachim

no, i do not believe this can be done with OAI-PMH. at the risk of going 
off on a tangent, let me suggest some solutions ...

maybe what you need is an &quot;extension&quot; or &quot;semantic overload&quot; or a new 
protocol altogether. now, a number of us have played around with 
interesting ways to extend OAI-PMH and we have learnt important lessons, 
many of which may be obvious, but i will try to list anyway:

firstly, look for existing protocols. i dont know any off the top of my 
head but maybe someone else does. search protocols probably wont do the 
trick because it sounds like you want to transfer a specific part of 
each record in the full set.

if you cannot find an existing protocol, do NOT then overload/extend the 
meaning of OAI-PMH! instead, design a completely separate protocol if 
you need to. generally, it is not a good idea to muddy the waters with 
different versions of OAI-PMH, especially if you intend to interoperate 
with other people (what you do wholly within your system is of course a 
different matter).

for example, you could define a small specification called &quot;Part 
Extraction Protocol (PEP?)&quot; as follows:
-- ListRecordParts returns the metadata similarly to OAI-PMH but with 
additional parameters that specify (maybe using XPath) subtrees of the 
metadata records (noting that there will be validation issues)
-- GetRecordPart does the same but with a single record

there is no rule that states a single repository should support only one 
protocol - your repository can then support OAI-PMH on one baseURL and 
&quot;PEP&quot; on another, in just the same way as some current repositories 
support OAI-PMH on one baseURL and SRW on another (for searching).

lastly, adopt current best practices and standards as defined by the OAI 
and Web community. what this means is:
- don't use a different style of record encoding if people already 
understand the OAI style ... i.e., header/metadata/etc
- think about SOAP - it is now a standard so there is no reason why new 
protocols should not use it and there are some benefits to it (like a 
large community of practice)
- be RESTful ... keep the simple things simple

this sounds complicated, but i think we need to get beyond basic 
OAI-PMH. real services need more interesting protocols for components to 
interact and metadata harvesting only gives you, well, whole chunks of 
harvested metadata :)

by now you have probably stopped reading this message, but if not, i 
have one last suggestion: how about an &quot;other_protocol&quot; description 
format for OAI-PMH Identify responses? does anyone else think it will be 
useful to know what other protocols can be used to interact with a data 
collection? for example, OCLC's ETD collection could list:

&lt;description&gt;
    &lt;protocol:protocol xmlns:protocol=&quot;...&quot; xmlns:dc=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
       &lt;dc:title&gt;SRW&lt;/dc:title&gt;
       &lt;dc:identifier xsi:type=&quot;dcterms:URI&quot;&gt;
          <A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/srw/specifications.html">http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/srw/specifications.html</A>
       &lt;/dc:identifier&gt;
       &lt;dc:coverage xsi:type=&quot;protocol:version&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/dc:coverage&gt;
       &lt;protocol:baseURL&gt;
          <A HREF="http://alcme.oclc.org/srw/search/NDL/SearchRetrieveService">http://alcme.oclc.org/srw/search/NDL/SearchRetrieveService</A>
       &lt;/protocol:baseURL&gt;
    &lt;/protocol:protocol&gt;
&lt;/description&gt;

could this possibly be useful for discovery/advertising of services? it 
is somewhat halfway between &quot;friends&quot; and WSDL and might already be done 
- anyone have pointers? or thoughts in general?

ttfn,
