&gt;<i> it looks most interesting ... here are some thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - your descriptions are for an independent external registry, while i 
</I>&gt;<i> was proposing a &quot;friends&quot;-like services offered on the same 
</I>&gt;<i> archive. as such, &quot;title&quot; would be a moot point, while you (rightly)
</I>require it.

Yes, I don't think Andy was proposing a separate external service a la
JISC IESR (which I should add is still very much just at the pilot
stage!), but rather suggesting that the &quot;service description&quot; that might
be embedded in the OAI-PMH Identify response might be kept to a very
minimal DC-based record that included a pointer to richer details
provided using existing specs/standards.

I should add that (as an occasional but not terribly prompt or timely
adviser to the IESR project) I have an outstanding action against me to
explore some of the elements of that service description schema to see
whether some of the &quot;proprietary&quot; aspects might be represented using
WSDL.

&gt;<i> - your service identifiers are assigned by a central 
</I>&gt;<i> authority - with a 
</I>&gt;<i> self-description, that should not be necessary (and may even violate 
</I>&gt;<i> some information independence principles)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - you do not have a formal identifier for the protocol and i 
</I>&gt;<i> think that is quite important to match clients and servers for
</I>services. i was 
&gt;<i> suggesting the canonical URI of the protocol specification. 
</I>
Well, except in so far as they are drawn from the controlled list here

<A HREF="http://www.mimas.ac.uk/iesr/profile/vocabs/#AccMthdList">http://www.mimas.ac.uk/iesr/profile/vocabs/#AccMthdList</A>

in which each of those values could be assigned a URI. But at the
moment, you're right, I don't think they are, and I agree it would be
better to use global &quot;canonical&quot; URIs for the protocols. Those URIs
might or might not be the URL of a human-readable spec though.

My memory of the WSDL specs is a bit hazy, but I think they use XML
QNames (rather than URIs) to identify/reference what they call
&quot;bindings&quot;?

&gt;<i> if someone 
</I>&gt;<i> comes up with a new CGI-based protocol, they SHOULD have a 
</I>&gt;<i> specification written down somewhere, otherwise i don't see the point
</I>of 
&gt;<i> advertising the interface publicly.
</I>
I'd pretty much agree with that, I think.

&gt;<i> - WSDL is tricky. did you use the draft spec or the technical note? 
</I>&gt;<i> there are encoding differences between the two, so until this 
</I>&gt;<i> becomes a standard, i am keeping my distance.
</I>
Ah... not sure! I'd have to check! ;-)
