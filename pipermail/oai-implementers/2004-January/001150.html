<PRE>hi

just wanted to reply to one specific issue - where you ask if two new 
&quot;Part&quot; verbs should not be considered for a new OAI-PMH version.

the current OAI-PMH is very popular largely because lots of prospective 
features were thrown out (during development of the protocol) to keep 
things simple - thus making implementation easier, faster and more accurate.

the principle adopted was that PMH transfers data - raw data - and thats 
it. anything more interesting than raw data transfer should be viewed as 
a different &quot;value-added&quot; service provided by a repository or service 
provider. in all likelihood, if there ever is a newer version of PMH, it 
will still do only raw data transfer :)

i should also add that Tim's solution (DC records to describe data, with 
pointers to actual data) is something we implemented at VT a few years 
ago for data similar to yours (large files of XML-encoded numerical data).

ttfn,
----hussein

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much for all your comments and the summary, your input

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the summary from my perspective:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand, that the actual version of OAI-PMH can request a whole 
</I>&gt;<i> record (XML document), but not a part of record (a fragment of XML 
</I>&gt;<i> document).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The proposal from Naomi (1) is a workaround, which will work if it's 
</I>&gt;<i> only necessary to request only a few defined parts of a record.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jeffs proposal (2a) has the attractive idea to request a part of a 
</I>&gt;<i> record by the means of XPATH. In my eye's it's a drawback to depend on a 
</I>&gt;<i> external service for the reason, that the &quot;main&quot; protocol (OAI-PMH) is 
</I>&gt;<i> lacking this feature (nothing against external services). I would like 
</I>&gt;<i> to think more about a general solution (for DDI). But nevertheless, 
</I>&gt;<i> Jeff, thank you very much for your offer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hussein's proposal (2b) of a new protocol on top of or parallel to 
</I>&gt;<i> OAI-PMH sounds very good. The proposed way to add this new protocol 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be very flexible also for other new protocols, it would be a 
</I>&gt;<i> way of a general extensibility of OAI-PMH. The question seems to me: is 
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;requesting a part of record&quot; not a candidate of a new version of 
</I>&gt;<i> OAI-PMH? &quot;GetRecordPart&quot; and &quot;ListRecordParts&quot; were the tools I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> looking for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The actual version of OAI-PMH has the intention of requesting whole 
</I>&gt;<i> records (primary use of harvesting protocol). The question of requesting 
</I>&gt;<i> a part of a record by the means of XPATH will arise with large XML 
</I>&gt;<i> documents. The service provider could be interested only in a part of 
</I>&gt;<i> the information. Large XML documents have usually DTDs/Schemas with a 
</I>&gt;<i> deeply nested structure and a lot of elements or have repeatable 
</I>&gt;<i> elements which could be repeated very often.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The size of DDI files reach often 500-1000 KB. The description of a 
</I>&gt;<i> social survey consists often in several hundred questions/variables and 
</I>&gt;<i> in an extensive general study description.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see one problem with the idea to request fragments of a XML document 
</I>&gt;<i> stored in a record: the client would not be able to validate the 
</I>&gt;<i> response, because it’s only a fragment of a XML document. A better 
</I>&gt;<i> solution would be to embed the fragment in a frame of a valid XML 
</I>&gt;<i> document (like a &quot;condensed version&quot; of a XML document). That would be 
</I>&gt;<i> dependent from the XML DTD/schema (the question would be, which elements 
</I>&gt;<i> are required).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now we are just thinking about using OAI-PMH to offer DDI-files. 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps there is another way to offer XML files for service providers, 
</I>&gt;<i> Hussein mentioned SOAP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will try to give the DDI community 
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/DDI/users/listserv.html">http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/DDI/users/listserv.html</A>) a hint on this 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion thread.
