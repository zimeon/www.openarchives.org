Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.21.0111151827140.15924-100000@sun8.loc.gov>

Today, the Library of Congress has made records for two substantial
collections of photographs available for harvesting.  Brief descriptions
for these two collections are below.

Brief descriptions of all the Library of Congress collections for which 
records are available is at:

PS to the folks at arc:  I notice that you harvested the records from our
unadvertised test server.  You may want to pull them again from the
production server.  We have made some minor adjustments to the MARC to DC
mapping and the Dublin Core records will be "better" than those you have.

setSpec: gottscho

Architecture and Interior Design for 20th Century America: Photographs by
Samuel Gottscho and William Schleisner, 1935-1955
 
     Description: The Gottscho-Schleisner Collection is comprised of over
29,000 images primarily of architectural subjects, including interiors and
exteriors of homes, stores, offices, factories, historic buildings, and
other structures. Subjects are concentrated chiefly in the northeastern
United States, especially the New York City area, and Florida. Included
are the homes of notable Americans, such as Raymond Loewy, and of several
U.S. presidents, as well as color images of the 1939-40 New York World's
Fair. Many of the photographs were commissioned by architects, designers,
owners and architectural publications, and document important achievements
in American 20th-century architecture and interior design.

setSpec: horyd

Washington as It Was: Photographs by Theodor Horydczak, 1923-1959
 
     Description: Spanning from the mid 1920s through the 1950s, the
Theodor Horydczak collection (about 14,350 photographs online) documents
the architecture and social life of the Washington metropolitan area in
the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, including exteriors and interiors of
commercial, residential, and government buildings, as well as street
scenes and views of neighborhoods.  A number of Washington events and
activities, such as the 1932 Bonus Army encampment, the 1933 World Series,
and World War II preparedness campaigns, are also depicted.

The two collections are available as a single set, setSpec: lcphotos

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.10.10111170114460.3738-100000@defiant.cs.odu.edu>

hi,

In OAI_GetRecord.xsd, it specifies 

<complexType name="metadataType">
 <sequence>
  <any namespace="##other" processContents="lax"/>
 </sequence>
</complexType>

and in dc.xsd, it specifies like

<element name="dc" type="dc:dublincoreType"/>
<complexType name="dublincoreType">
....

The question is: If we use "processContents="lax" in OAI_GetRecord.xsd,
xmlschema validator will treat 
<GetRecord>....<xxx_dc><title>...</title></xxx_dc>..</GetRecord>  as
valid,
 
but <xxx_dc>...</xxx_dc> may not be the right format in our intention, it
passes schema validator only because processContents="lax" is used in
Get_Record.xsd. We probably want to always use <dc>....<dc>.

I have this doubt when I try to process OAI response with XSLT, the arXiv
uses <oai_dc>...</oai_dc>, it passed oaiexplorer test and other schema
validator (oracle and XMLSpy). But this really brings some troubles to
XSLT processing. 

If I change Get_record.xsd to processContents="strict", this problem will
be reported by schema validator.

Do we have special reason of using processContents="lax"?

Xiaoming Liu

Hi,

If I understand your query correctly, Chris (of e-prints) and I had a
discussion about this some time ago.

The conclusion we came to was that you should use the namespace attribute
rather than the name of the metadata enclosure (be it "dc" or "oai_dc"), to
identify the type of metadata.

I believe you can perform XSLT based on attribute values?

All the best,
Tim Brody

Message-ID: <3BF7F126.7060801@vt.edu>

hi

while it is true that namespace attributes can be used to disambiguate, 
the root tag of the metadata ("dc" or "oai_dc") has to belong to some 
namespace to be validifiable.

as it stands, that tag is defined in the schema for dc, and it is named 
"dc" so i believe that if you use "oai_dc" it is just simply not correct 
as far as schema validity goes.

and the problem doesnt end here, because with "lax" validation you can 
put any nonsense into your record and call it "dc" xml ...

i agree somewhat with Xiaoming and i have raised this issue before in 
the context of the repository explorer. the problem is that people with 
exotic data types may not have the know-how to write schemas. so its a 
dilemma: either we exclude people who cant write schemas or we allow 
people to ignore schemas altogether ... right now we are doing the 
latter and i dont know if that is reasonable.

we need to think this through more carefully ...

Subject: [OAI-implementers] DP9- An OAI Gateway Service for Web Crawlers
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.10.10111210015200.7225-100000@defiant.cs.odu.edu>

Hi all,

(appologies for cross-posting)

A new OAI service provider for Web Crawlers- DP9 is available, the idea
comes from one discussion in this list -- how to index OAI archives in
Google? 
 
DP9 is a gateway service that enables indexing of an OAI data provider by
an Internet search engine. The DP9 allows a web crawler to retrieve
records in an OAI collection by executing OAI requests and translating XML
responses into HTML format on behalf of a web crawler. 
 
Below are the services that DP9 provides:
 
An entry page,if Web Crawler find entry page and dig into these links, it
will index all records in an OAI data provider. 
 http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/index.jsp
 
Persistent and bookmarkable URL for OAI record. An example,     

 http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/getrecord.jsp?identifier=oai:arXiv:astro-ph/9501031&prefix=oai_dc
 
Parallel metadata Set, but only limited format is supported now,  new
metadata support could be easily added-- just send us your XSL file

http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/getrecord.jsp?identifier=oai:VTETD:etd-3345131939761081&prefix=oai_rfc1807
 
The DP9 code is available from 
   http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/install.jsp
It's based on JSP and XSLT, if you install it in your own server, it will
make your OAI compliant archive webcrawler-enabled, and with your own URL.
 
DP9 is a gateway service, it doesn't cache the OAI record and just
forwards any request to corresponding OAI data provider, so its quality of
service is highly depended on the server availabity of OAI data providers.
 
DP9 now uses the data providers list from OAI website
 http://www.openarchives.org/Register/ListFriends.pl

We'd welcome any feedback or advice.

Doesn't the '?' in this URL mean that at least some search engines will
not index this resource?  It might be better to configure things so that
the persistent URL is of the form

 http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/getrecord/oai_dc/oai:arXiv:astro-ph/9501031

maybe some won't, but I think that convention has been mostly ignored.

In http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/reports/ crawlers happily trudge through all
my reports, each of which has an index.cgi with arguments.  inktomi,
google and others happily invoke every possible combination presented to
them.

And robots.txt does not allow me to have a line like:

	Disallow: /reports/*/*/index.cgi

I could shut off all robots, but so far the load has not been too
bad.  But I'm considering using DP9 for robot access -- it might make
their crawls a little smarter.

regards,

Michael

Hi,

I have added a wrapper program, it will accept the regular URL and call
the corresponding jsp/servlet application. It's implemented by server-side
include method so there is no http redirection involved.

So now the new format is like a static one. like
 http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/getrecord/oai_dc/oai:aps:tmp1

The APIs and URLs I mentioned before are still valid, they implement the
functionalities behind the scene.

See the new format in http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/index.jsp
