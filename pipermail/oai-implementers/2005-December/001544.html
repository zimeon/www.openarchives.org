<PRE>Call for proposals - Code4lib 2006

We are now accepting proposals for prepared talks for Code4lib 2006. [1]
Code4lib 2006 is a loosely structured conference for library technologists
to commune, gather/create/share ideas and software, be inspired, and forge
collaborations. It is also an outgrowth of the Access HackFest, wrapped into
a conference-ish format. It is *the* event for technologists building
digital libraries and digital information systems, tools, and software.

At least six time slots will be available for prepared talks. We will choose
from among the proposals based on diversity of topics, usefulness, wow
factor, and potential impact.

Proposals of 75 words or less are being accepted for review now. Please send
your name, email address, and proposal to code4libcon. [2]

We cannot accept every prepared talk proposal, but multiple lightning talk
sessions will provide everyone who wishes to present with ample opportunity
to show off. The proposal deadline is January 2, 2006, and proposers will be
notified by January 9, 2006.

Prepared Talk Information

Prepared talks are 20 minutes, and must center on &quot;tools&quot; (some cool new
software, software library or integration platform), &quot;specs&quot; (how to get the
most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones), or &quot;challenges&quot; (One
or more big problems we should collectively address). We will evaluate
proposals on criteria of usefulness, newness, geekiness, and diversity of
topics.
