I just happened to run across this recently and can't remember seeing  
it announced on oai-implementors:

   http://drupal.org/project/oai2

Drupal is a rather elegant (and free) content management system  
written in PHP. My apologies if this already was announced.

Please can service providers harvest from this base_url.

The service located at http://eprints.dcu.ie/perl/oai2 will be retired.

Message-ID: <44EF0A41.8010602@ifremer.fr>

Dear all,

the "La P?rouse" library has just released Avano 
(http://www.ifremer.fr/avano/), an OAI harvester for the marine and 
aquatic sciences. It offers an access to electronic resources about 
aquaculture and fisheries for instance, but also marine biology, marine 
geosciences,...).

What's original in this harvester is that we developed a system that 
allow to detect notices about marine and aquatic resources loaded in 
non-specialized marine repositories such as ArXiv or PubmedCentral. This 
system is based on the detection of marine and aquatic terms such as 
oceanography or phytoplankton for example.

With this system, Avano is already able to offer an access to about 24 
000 notices that comes from more than 30 repositories. And we will load 
more repositories and more notices in the coming weeks.

We would be pleased if you could share your comments about this project.

Kind regards,
Fred Merceur

Hello,

since I sent this message on the oai-implementers list, the global 
Network of our research institute was indeed down most of the time. We 
first experimented some Apache problems, then some Internet server 
hardware problems, and this afternoon some Tomcat problems that make it 
very slow (it that what we call the demo effect?). These problems should 
be fixed now (until the next one :-( ), and Avano should offers fast 
responses back.

Sorry for all these problems.

Kind regards,
Fred

Your going to have to use a resumptionToken because there is a limit to how
big of a page should be.  A common thing to do is to return 100 records and
then use the resumptionToken mechanism to continue.

A better way to determine "chunk size":  
 
1.  figure out your average record size (in bytes)
2.  pick a number so response size is between .5 and 2 MB

Is this a CONTENTdm system?  'oai.exe' often indicates CONTENTdm, but 
not always.

Earlier versions of CONTENTdm did not have support for resumptionToken, 
but recent versions have.  If you have an old version of CONTENTdm you 
may need to upgrade.
