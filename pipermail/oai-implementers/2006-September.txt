Dear OAI Implementers' Community,

 

I have been the project manager on a two-year Institute of Museum and
Library Services (IMLS) funded grant, awarded to the Digital Library
Federation (DLF) to develop a second-generation OAI finding system and
leverage the lessons learned from OAI early adopters. A project team
composed of experts from Emory University and the universities of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Michigan, with the help of an extended
team of focus groups, scholars, and technical advisors, has worked
earnestly and effectively to prototype new and improved OAI finding
systems for libraries (DLF OAI Portal and DLF MODS Portal), best
practices for metadata creation and improved
communication/interoperability between data and service providers
(DLF/NSDL Best Practices for OAI Data Provider Implementations and
Sharable Metadata), and training materials for novice implementations
(DLF OAI Implementers' Workshop documents). Access to many of the
project deliverables and an abstract describing the project is available
from http://www.diglib.org/architectures/oai/imls2004/. I hope many of
you will benefit from this effort to further the mission and impact of
OAI.

 

Respectfully,

 

Barrie L. Howard
