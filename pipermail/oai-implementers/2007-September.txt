Message-ID: <AAC56210B95BE34FBCA9FE7822FD7E0D011A54F5@swnes02.english-heritage.org.uk>

Hi,
 
I've noticed that some service providers include thumbnails in their
search results.  I'd quite like to make this facility available for any
harvesters of our repository who wish to use it, but can't find any
specific references in any of the OAI DC guidelines explaining what the
XML should look like.
 
Can anyone tell me if there an accepted protocol for exposing
thumbnails, or is it something agreed between individual repositories
and harvesters?
 
Many thanks

A thumbnail isn't useful for information discovery per se, so I would  
imagine that it would be likely to be a repository-service issue. It  
may be that a OAI-service would have rules for finding thumbnails  
based on repository platform in the same way that has to have rules  
about finding the data/files/objects/bitstreams that correspond to an  
OAI item.

For example, if you know that foo.bar.org is an EPrints v3  
repository, then the item that corresponds to oai:foo.bar.org:10456  
would have a thumbnail for its first bitstream at http://foo.bar.org/ 
102/thumbnails/1/preview.png

This of course, is not a very satisfactory solution!

Hi,

At the University of Illinois, we have worked as a service provider on 
several possibilities :
- asking data providers to include a URL to a thumbnails in their 
metadata record. The easiest way was to use a thumbnail element, used by 
the National Library of Australia for their Picture Australia Service. 
That's DC + that element
- asking people to provider a richer representation of their resources, 
using a specific format which allows to express the different "views" of 
a picture (thumbnail, large ...). A similar approach can be taken with 
DIDL for instance or METS records. The work on this approach was part of 
the DLF-Aquifer project, 
http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october06/cole/10cole.html. The format does not 
really matter, but it is to propose a richer representation of resources.
- a 3rd approach consisted in using the URLs found in the records and 
parse the pages to either recognize or create a thumbnails from the data 
providers Websites (with their kind permission :-)). 
https://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/bitstream/2142/72/3/Assets.ppt.pdf  and a 
poster "An OAI-PMH Based Thumbnail Capture & Delivery Service" 
http://oai5.web.cern.ch/oai5/images/posters/31-Cole.pdf.
The following paper gives an overview of the issue 
http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january06/foulonneau/01foulonneau.html

Most service providers do not use thumbnails because they do not deal 
with pictures only. But Picture Australia is definitely a good example 
of SP dealing with pictures and having a clear interest in showing 
thumbnails. Aquifer uses thumbnails, American West as well, the CIC 
metadata portal, the IMLS digital collections and content. All those 
examples have indeed agreement between data providers and service 
providers. I am not certain of last developments, other people could 
complete. I do not think there are generally accepted protocols.

Hope that helps.

Hello list,

As someone relatively recently aware of OAI, I wondered if there'd been
any discussion of solutions to allow relatively normal people to be data
providers. Not to imply that the managers of university repositories are
abnormal, but the average Joe -- well, the average Dr. Joe who wants to
slap his latest article on his Web site and be "OAI-conformant"*.

I see there are a few OAI plugins for "normal person" CMSes:
WordPress: http://www.wallandbinkley.com/quaedam/?p=50
Drupal: http://drupal.org/project/oai2
Zope: http://www.pentila.com/produits/ZOpenArchives/

Another approach is copy & paste metadata. Creative Commons, for
instance, uses Dublin Core properties in its license metadata (e.g. in RDF):
http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Implement_Metadata

Does anyone have thoughts on OAI for "normal people", e.g. desirability,
feasibility, implementations?

* For the sake of argument, Dr. Joe isn't archiving in his university's
institutional repository because it doesn't have one, there's not a
disciplinary repository in his field, etc.

Any thoughts on what to do if an identifier moves to a different set? This
situation does not warrant a 'delete' response, but if a user pulls a given
set one day and then later pulls the same set the moved record will appear
to have been deleted.

As I read the spec, the client in your example would be incorrect in 
concluding from the absence of the record in a set that it has been 
deleted. If the repo supports deletion, then it must comply with 2.5.1:

> responses to selective harvesting requests with set membership and
> date range criteria that include deleted records must include the
> headers of these records. Incremental harvesting will thus discover
> deletions from repositories that keep track of them.

If it doesn't, the client could issue a GetRecord and check for 
idDoesNotExist.

Hi Gavin,

Just saw the following message.  If you're interested in such things,
and by the looks of it you are, you might want to stop by #code4lib on
freenode.  Lots of people in there dealing with data-transmission
standards and information-access challenges in all kinds of
environments.  There's also a pretty active code4lib mailing list.

My own opinion is if you're interested in opening up your data via OAI,
by all means, go for it!  That's what the OAI plugins were created for.
It's not clear from sites like oaister.org and openarchives.org what
their requirements are for a data contributor, and having been involved
only within an institutional setting I don't know about "the average Dr.
Joe", but I think you'll find as long as you provide an OAI-conforming
repository you won't run into a lot of friction.

Happy hacking,
Gabe

I would also put in a plug for building a Static Repository, designed for
those without the resources for developing their own OAI repository. There's
information on the openarchives.org site:
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm
and also on the OAI Best Practices site:
http://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/oaibp/index.php/StaticRepositori
es

Tom Habing at UIUC has also created a FilemakerPro tool (thabing at uiuc dot
edu), and folks at Emory have created a Metadata Migrator
(www.metascholar.org/sw/mm/) tool for mapping records to OAI.
