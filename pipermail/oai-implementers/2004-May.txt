Subject: [OAI-implementers] Kepler Version 1.2 - Sourceforge Release
Message-ID: <OF3E365528.CF24C9E6-ON85256E97.00797842@cs.odu.edu>

The Digital Library Research Group at Old Dominion University is pleased to
release Kepler Version 1.2 as open source software, and is available for
download at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/oaikepler/


The objective of Kepler is to give any user the ability to easily
self-archive publications by means of an "archivelet": a self-contained,
self-installing software system that functions as an Open Archives
Initiative data provider. Kepler archivelets are designed to be easy to
install, use and maintain. Kepler is a perfect solution for those that need
to be OAI-PMH compliant, but do not have the resources for more complex
OAI-PMH software installations. Some features of Kepler include:

*Configurable community standards
*Tailored publication and search services
*Broad and fast dissemination
*Interoperable with other communities

For more information, please visit the Kepler web site:

This project is supported by NSF Award 205486 and is a joint effort of
various parts of the US Geological Survey (USGS), Old Dominion University
(ODU), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the Open Language Archives
Community (OLAC).

Subject: [OAI-implementers] New OAI set from LC -- of digitized books
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.21.0405251616520.21247-100000@sun8.loc.gov>


This is a message to selective harvesters of records for LC digitized
historical content.  Today we released a new set of records -- for about
250 digitized books, corresponding to the American Memory collection
  American Notes: Travels in America, 1750-1920                           
  http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/lhtnhtml/lhtnhome.html                      
                                                                          
We also created a combined set -- lcbooks -- which for now just includes
this collection and the collection of dance manuals released some time
ago.  More books will be added over the coming months.  Some may be
individual books digitized for reasons other than inclusion in an American
Memory collection.
                                                                          
Please let me know if there are any problems.
