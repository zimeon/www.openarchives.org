<PRE>Using the setSpec is a good suggestion. We've envisioned using the setSpec
to denote each sub-collection where the setSpec hierarchy would be used to
describe sub-collection-specific attributes as opposed to metadataFormats.
If two separate sub-collections are available in the same metadataFormat
but are otherwise unrelated, one could certainly construct another set of
setSpecs to describe this relationship, however this muddies the semantics
of the setSpec.

Another way to look at it is from the harvesters point of view. If I know
I can only handle metatadataFormat oai_dc, and I'm interested in updating
my list of id's against yours, it would be nice to simply request a list
of identifiers of metadataPrefix=oai_dc.

We envision using ListIdentifiers as a way to synch metadata in the case
where records have been deleted. For example, if a record has been
deleted, a call to ListRecords&amp;from=2001-09-17&amp;metadataPrefix=oai_dc is
not guaranteed to reveal this deletion, and this would be the common daily
or weekly harvesting done by our collaborators. In such a case it's
necessary to make a call to ListIdentifiers in order to detect deleted
records in the harvested collection.

Using the setSpec for this is a good suggestion however and it certainly
beats having to use the GetRecords request when all you need are the ids.

Many thanks,

 - John

</I>&gt;<i> I think that with the current (v1.1) protocol your suggestion of

</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the question of whether this facility should be added to the

</I>&gt;<i> this is a community specific situation then it might perhaps be best for
