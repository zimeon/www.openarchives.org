</I>
In my scenario, I was assuming that not all records in a repository are
actually exported via OAI-PMH (e.g. this is the case for Invenio
instances such as the CERN Document Server). In our implementation, only
records that belongs to at least a set are actually exported. So if a
record was at some point in the past available in a set, it would have
been exported as well when the ?set= argument was missing. On the other
hand, if the record is removed from the set, and is in general no longer
exported (but is still in the repository), then there will be no
advertisement about this event (in incremental harvesting).

In general this problem simply show up when a record is no longer
exported, but nevertheless it is still available in the repository (and
hence can't really be considered as formally &quot;deleted&quot;).

&gt;<i> Yes, but you can keep doing incremental harvests instead of throwing
</I>&gt;<i> everything away and doing a full reharvest every month. So it is not
</I>&gt;<i> that clear which scenario consumes the most bandwith.
</I>
Indeed :-)

&gt;<i>Ah that sounds very interesting indeed. I wont be attending OAI7 this
</I>&gt;<i>time since I opted for the EuroPython conference in Florence, which is
</I>&gt;<i>in the same week.. I'll suggest the talk to my colleague who is going.
</I>
Ooh... Also this one looks very interesting! 

Cheers!
	Samuele
