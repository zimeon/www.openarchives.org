<PRE>Hi Jasper,

&gt;<i> &gt; Another issue that came up recently has to do with incremental harvesting. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; harvester guidelines mention that for the value of the from parameter, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `responseDate` should be used, and that it is advisable to overlap by a small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; additional amount.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it would be better if a harvester does not use the responseDate, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead uses the latest datestamp of all harvested records.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Consider the following situation:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Someone modifies a document in a database at 4 o'clock.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An external OAI service gets updated once an hour, so it will have the changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at 5 o'clock. The OAI software will use the modification dates from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; database, so at 5 o'clock the modified record is added with a datestamp of 4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; o'clock.
</I>Wich in turn evoces the fatal consequences you describe.

Whenever you have an intermediate service as base for the repository,
you have two choices:

- Keep copies and on update of each individual record modify its
  datestamp to the time of update (or - if you get a copy of everything:
  modify the datestamps of all records newer than the last update

- Keep a *complete* list of all individual times an update of the
  service has taken place and adjust all internal queries for time
  intervals and all Datestamps in OAI-Headers to the correct (upper
  or lower) interval boundary from this list.

Personally I'm involved with repositories for which unfortunately none
of these strategies is feasible: The OAI service does not have a
database of its own and the database it utilizes is updated infrequently
by prompting administrators to upload a &quot;production version&quot; of the
database onto the web-exposed host. And none of the persons involved
takes the trouble adding the timestamp of this action to a config file.

But also better-kept repositories sometimes have trouble with their
indexing and erroneously deliver no records for intervals where there
actually had been some changes, thus arising the need to re-harvest.
Unfortunately the protocol specification does not include measures to
communicate such reharvesting instructions, the known harvesters then
are alerted by a mailing list, but of course OAI-PMH is mostly
about giving access without the need of prior &quot;registration&quot;...

The strategy you describe fits the above scenarios very well and
can be implemented in harvesters very cheaply: For incremental harvesting
the timestamp of &quot;last successful harvest&quot; has to be stored anyway and
noting the first (of several delivered) ResponseDates or the maximum
of all delivered dateStamp's does not make much of a difference.
Semantically it would constitute the &quot;evidenced last known state&quot;
of the repository...
