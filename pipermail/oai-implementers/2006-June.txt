Subject: [OAI-implementers] New version of the PKP Metadata Harvester now
	available
Message-ID: <4481ABCE.5030508@sfu.ca>

Version 2 of the Public Knowledge Project Metadata Harvester is now 
available at http://pkp.sfu.ca/harvester2 . The Metadata Harvester is 
open source software, under the GPL license, developed and maintained by 
the Public Knowledge Project, a three-way partnership of the Faculty of 
Education at the University of British Columbia under the direction of 
John Willinsky; Simon Fraser University Library; and Simon Fraser 
University's Canadian Centre for Studies in Publishing (CCSP).

The Harvester provides the ability to aggregate and search metadata 
exposed using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata 
Harvesting (OAI-PMH). Features include:

-Ability to harvest OAI metadata in a variety of schemas (comes with 
unqualified DC, the PKP (Open Journal Systems/Open Conference Systems) 
Dublin Core extension, MODS, and MARCXML).

-Flexible search interface that allows simple searching and advanced 
searching using crosswalked fields. Advanced searching of archives that 
share the same schema is possible using fields as defined in the schema. 
When creating crosswalks for searching, administrators can define 
elements as text, date, or HTML multiple select interface widgets.

-Ability to perform granular harvesting using setSpec and timestamps.

-Ability to perform post-harvest and pre-indexing 
filtering/normalization on metadata.

-Ability to customize the user interface using CSS and template-based HTML.

-Ability to add plugins for extending harvesting, filtering, and other 
types of functionality.

-Searching is highly scalable (creates an inverted index for searching).

Development of version 2 of the PKP Metadata Harvester has been 
supported by the Canadian Association of Research Libraries 
(http://www.carl-abrc.ca/), Simon Fraser University Library 
(http://www.lib.sfu.ca), and the Public Knowledge Project 
(http://pkp.ubc.ca/).

The Harvester is a PHP/MySQL application and has been tested on Linux, 
but should run on any platform. Administrator and technical 
documentation for the Harvester is also available. Community support is 
provided through the PKP Support Forum at http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum/ .

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Draft of 'Expressing Dublin Core metadata in XML'
Message-ID: <5639156310BCBA459673B0D709D28C0F161C84@eduwbl01.edu2000.com>

Members of the list may be interested to note that DCMI recently
announced the availability of a document "Expressing Dublin Core
metadata in XML" [1]. This is a working draft which has been circulated
for public comment.

The primary motivation for this work is to provide an XML format which
is based on the DCMI Abstract Model (DCAM) [2], and which provides an
XML serialisation for all of the constructs of the DCAM (or at least for
some well-defined subset). This XML format is referred to in the
document as DC-XML.

The DC-XML format is a different XML format from that specified by the
current DCMI recommendation for expressing DC metadata in XML [3]. That
recommendation pre-dated the developmemt of the DCAM, and was based on
models for a "simple DC metadata record" and a "qualified DC metadata
record".

Further details are provided in a message to the dc-architecture mailing
list [4]

For OAI-PMH implementers, the following points may be worth noting:

(i) The publication of this draft does not in any way change the nature
or status of the oai_dc XML format defined by the OAI-PMH specification.


(ii) The oai_dc XML format is an implementation of the "simple DC
metadata record" model and of the guidelines for XML encoding described
in [3]. Applications based on that XML format and on that "simple DC
metadata record" model will continue to function.

(iii) It will be possible to specify an algorithmic transformation
between the oai_dc XML format and the DC-XML format (e.g. in the form of
an XSLT stylesheet), so that oai_dc instances can be transformed into
DC-XML instances and made accessible to applications based on DC-XML and
the DCAM.

(iv) Some OAI-PMH implementers have developed XML formats based on the
"qualified DC metadata record" model and on the guidelines for XML
encoding in [3]. Again, applications based on such XML formats and on
that "qualified DC metadata record" model will continue to function. 

(v) Unfortunately, the "qualified DC metadata record" model does not
correspond to a subset of the DCAM. There are constructs in the
"qualified DC metadata record" model that do not have a clear
correspondence in the DCAM.  It is therefore probably not possible to
define a mapping between the constructs of that "qualified DC metadata
record" model and the DCAM. (Note: this was the case before this recent
draft was published).

(vi) Although a general mapping is probably not possible, the developers
of individual metadata formats based on the "qualified DC metadata
record" model _may_ be able to specify a mapping between the way the
constructs of the "qualified DC record model" have been used in the
context of their formats and the DCAM. 

(vii) If such a mapping can be made, then it would be possible to
specify algorithmic transformations (e.g. XSLT) between each of those
XML formats and the DC-XML format, so that instances could be
transformed into DC-XML instances and made accessible to applications
based on DC-XML and on the DCAM, if required. However it seems likely
that such transformations would have to be developed on a
format-by-format basis.

Cheers

Pete

Subject: [OAI-implementers] A brand New software to build OAI-PMH
	Institutional Archives
In-Reply-To: <445F2BE7.80405@area.bo.cnr.it>
References: <op.s867ndv92yyrvh@maxpc-3b0tx5z2f> <445F2BE7.80405@area.bo.cnr.it>

Dear all,

few weeks ago, the digitAlexandria project (www.digitalexandria.com),
 from the Italian National Research Council, has released
the pre-beta version of Archivemaker, a new software
for building OAI-PMH-compliant institutional archives.
The main characteristcs of the software are:

- Few minutes are enough to install and build the archive
- An average pc user can easely do all the work
- Direct and easy groupware management
- Powerful management of the internal and external visibility
     of each document
- Automatic creation of a web page showing the archive.
     A provisional page is here (remember that is not an official
     page, but a test page):

  http://bdaweb.bo.cnr.it:8000/servlet_query-browse_gtype-0_gid-83_opengid-79_style-bda

If you want to try the software, you can get it here,
along with a Beginner's Guide:

http://bdaweb.bo.cnr.it:8000/download_am.php

You can sign in with the following UN and PW:

UN		PW
guest2e	Guest2e
guest3d	Guest3d
(capital letters count)

Try the first; if it's busy, try the
second. If they are both busy, ask another UN and PW
by replying this email.

We will be grateful to all those who will report us bugs,
advices and suggestions at tech@bdaweb.net.

Max

Message-ID: <3147686DE3EDFF4EB9041934ACEE3F44383112@file-srv.nelinetinc.nelinet.lan>

I've noticed that a lot of groups that do harvesting are experimenting
with automatically clustering together similar metadata terms in order
to aid browsing.  Sounds neat (and potentially quite useful).

My question is, how?  Are folks using some sort of off-the shelf
clusterer or indexer, or is everybody rolling their own code?

Subject: [OAI-implementers] OAICat set lists question
Message-ID: <44A52268.2090903@hulmail.harvard.edu>

I'm having trouble figuring out just what the Crosswalk properties 
should look like for OAICat.  Currently I have a property as follows:

Crosswalks.MODS=edu.harvard.hul.ois.oaiprovider.MODSCrosswalk

But I have to override several functions in the MODSCrosswalk class to 
get a reasonable response to ListSets, and suspect that there's 
something I'm not missing.  Can someone offer some hints?

Hi Gary,

Let me contact you outside the list to find an answer. I don't think
others will the solution that interesting.

I meant ListMetadataFormats, of course.
