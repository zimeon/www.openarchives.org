	items, new dc types
Message-ID: <19ADCC0B9D4CAD4582BB9900BBCE357401AA0E02@tayexc13.americas.cpqcorp.net>

Hi Liam,

Actually it's a weird corner case where it's not clear to me what the
'right' thing to do is.  It could be that the repository explorer is
wrong, or DSpace.

Basically
http://demo.openrepository.com/demo-oai/request?verb=ListIdentifiers&met
adataPrefix=oai_dc asks for all records which have oai_dc metadata.  You
*have* to ask for a particular metadata prefix with ListIdentifiers.

But when you actually ask for the oai_dc metadata on a deleted item,
DSpace reports there is no oai_dc metadata for that item.  Because there
isn't.  Because it's been deleted.

However, if DSpace simply didn't include <record status="deleted"> for
that item in the ListIdentifiers response, harvesters would never know
the record had actually been deleted.

DSpace could simply claim to have oai_dc metadata for deleted items in a
ListMetadataFormats response, but this doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, it could give an 'idDoesNotExist' error code, but this
doesn't feel right either.  ListMetadataFormats doesn't provide any
means to indicate something like status="deleted".

I've CC'd this to oai-implementers, in case anyone there can give us
some pointers -- what's the appropriate behaviour?

well, for starters, i would say the repository explorer is wrong and 
shouldnt make any ListMetaFormats requests for deleted ids ... so ive 
fixed that! it now searches for the first non-deleted id in the ListIds 
response or assumes no id exists if all ids are deleted.

the broader question of orthogonality of the deletion feature is of 
course more difficult ... (and something we dredge up every now and then 
with no resolution :))

Hi,

     in course of designing a business registry for a region I wonder 
whether OAI-PMH could be an enabling technology for implementing 
UDDI.V3. I would be grateful for any information about relevant activities.
