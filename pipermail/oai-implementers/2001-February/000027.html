I have found temporary tables make life simpler ... or at least as easy as
implementing encoding and decoding of resumptionToken strings.

A more detailed explanation of what I'm doing:

The resumptionToken I'm generating is a &quot;session token&quot;, that is it is
unique to the query that generated it (and is not supposed to be harvester
understandable).
For each token I generate I create a table with the same name, see tmpXXX
below. ( FYI I'm using token = offset+remote_addr+time+rand()+metadataPrefix )

The resumptionToken has a limited life-span, currently I've got it set to
30 minutes. Each time the resumptionToken is used I refresh its
timestamp, so if a query takes longer than 30 minutes (with multiple
resumptions) it will not timeout.

Each time a query is made I clear tables older than 30 minutes. BTW The
time to live (TTL) of tokens is unspecified by OAI (an error 400 should be
returned if you have discarded the token - not yet implemented by me).

My tables:
tmpIndex
========
	tableName = The unique name of the table
	timestamp = The last time this table was accessed

tmpXXX
======
	pos = The index of the identifier, used for finding the offset
		to resume from
	identifier = The OAI identifier

I have purposely not copied the metadata into the temporary table to avoid
getting &quot;explosive&quot; growth in database size, besides it makes finding the
offset faster and the operation to find the metadata given an identifier
is O(1).

Chris has suggested some improvements to this scheme:
- Store the request parameters in the tmpIndex, therefore if two (or 40)
harvesters simultaneously request the same data you need not run the same
search more than once
- Store the metadataPrefix in tmpIndex, therefore avoiding the need to
encode this parameter (the resumption offset still needs to be encoded)

As a last thought about timeouts:
What do you do if a harvester requests, gets a resumptionToken, then uses
that token a week later? My instinct would be, if the token is still
alive, it should complete the list as it existed a week ago rather than
putting in any alterations. But ... I can't see anything in the OAI
protocol that makes it explicit about whether alterations to data should
be reflected during flow control (?).

&gt;<i>    And yes, I for one would like to see your OAI &quot;bits&quot;;  I'd love to
</I>&gt;<i> compare how I'm doing things with how others are, to see if I can improve
</I>&gt;<i> on my methods.
</I>
Thank you. I am coding in PERL modules - I will make an effort to get it
all together in a web page - I fear they will not be as accomplished as
Jeff Young's servlets!

All the best,
Tim.
