Subject: [OAI-implementers] static repository gateways
Message-ID: <BAY128-W441CA5280075E3D8CA4F13C62D0@phx.gbl>

I am working with a group to make their
digital collection harvestable as a static repository and looking
for a directory of gateways to register with. Could someone point me to
a list of gateways?

Thanks so much,
Elizabeth

Hello Elizabeth,

You should be able to such information at:
https://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/oaibp/index.php/StaticRepositor
ies
There isn't a list, per se, but it mentions the UIUC and Los Alamos
gateways, and how to set up your static repository with the UIUC service.

From HUTCHINSONA at si.edu  Tue Feb 19 14:33:32 2008

Subject: [OAI-implementers] Time stamp preventing OAI harvest?
Message-ID: <E89010005DD2A14C9BA6B4AF11BF84B89E34C6@SI-ECL03.US.SINET.SI.EDU>

I have been trying to run the conformance test for my repository as a
data provider using the tool at
openarchives.org/data/registerasprovider.html. 

 

I enter my URL and the site passes the first test. I click on the link
provided in the acknowledgement email and during phase two, the message
I get back is that my server is throwing an HTTP 500 error.

 

And if I use the following link on my own:
http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace-oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix
=oai_dc

I do indeed get an HTTP 500 error

 

But when I include the timestamp as in:
http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace-oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix
=oai_dc&from=2006-05-15

It returns the data seemingly without any problem.

 

My oaicat.properties file contains the time stamp listed above
(2006-05-15) but the conformance test tool does not seem to recognize
it. Is there something else I need to do to conform, pass the validation
and set up my repository as a data provider?

 

I have considered searching the OAI implementers archive but an
exhaustive search it would require opening each month's messages one at
a time (unless I'm missing something).

 

Thanks in advance for any advice,

 

Alvin Hutchinson

Hello,

I guess you archive will have to be able to answer the 2 queries. 
Indeed, when you will register your archive into an harvester, it will 
fisrt run a complete harvest to get the backlog. So the harvester will 
run the query that does not work on your archive.

http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace-oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

Then, most of harvesters will run regulary some incremental harvesting 
to get the records modified, deleted or added since the previous 
harvest. To do so they will run the query with the from parameter.

http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace-oai/request?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&from=2006-05-15

Kind regards,
Fred

Hi Alvin,

As maintainer of the validator I argue that you must support the query without
dates because it is part of the specification. As Fred points out, it is also
commonly used.

Cheers,
Simeon

Subject: [OAI-implementers] UM Announces Additional Collections for OAI
	Harvesting
Message-ID: <C3E4B1C0.14B40%khage@umich.edu>

The University of Michigan Library is pleased to announce that records
pointing to digitized materials from our Digital Library Production Service
(DLPS) and Scholarly Production Office (SPO) are available for OAI
harvesting through the same data provider as our MBooks collection records.

    http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/o/oai/oai?verb=Identify
    http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/o/oai/oai?verb=ListSets

To date, these records have been available through our "broker20" data
provider (http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/b/broker20/broker20/). We will be
turning off OAI harvesting from this service on March 3, 2008.

DLPS/SPO records available in the new service have been reviewed for correct
mapping and clarity. Additionally, new and modified records will show up
faster as the result of more streamlined processing.

For any questions about the service, please contact dlps-help@umich.edu.
