Message-ID: <200503031836.j23IaAGD032310@ramsay.cis.strath.ac.uk>


Hi,
apologies if this has been brought up before.

I have just read "Resource Harvesting within the OAI-PMH Framework" (Van de
Sompel, Nelson, Lagoze, Warner), where issues of ambiguity in locating
resources as well as changes to resources have been related to the
inadequacy of simple metadata formats (primarily Dublin Core) in supporting
OAIPMH-driven resource harvesting. 

Part of the argument is based on the observation that, in the semantics of
the OAI-PMH, datestamps capture change to metadata (records precisely), but
not change to resources. The latter may then go unnoticed (if the metadata
has not changed) or too eagerly assumed (if the metadata only has changed).
Problems are thus those of incomplete or inefficient resource harvesting. 

Complex object formats are offered as a potential solution, for they
represent metadata along with the corresponding resources (by-value or
by-reference), so that any change to the latter induces change to the entire
representation and thus the updating of datestamps.

A couple of questions now:

1) how do complex object formats may help with the problem of redundant
harvesting?
2) more importantly, is the propagation of change from resources to metadata
really dependent on the exchange format? Couldn't a provider use DC and yet
enforce a strong versioning policy which translate changes to resource in
new items (and thus records)? Even when (minor) changes are allowed to
preserve the identity of the resources, and thus no versioning takes place,
could not a provider reflect those changes in the datestamp of the
associated metadata records?

Overall, I wonder whether both problems are not related to the provider's
policy rather than the exchange format per se. At best, the adoption of
complex object formats reveals a commitment to change propagation -- among
many other complexity-inducing management policies. This commitment is then
most visible in the case of inclusion by-reference of content within the
overall resource representation; without it, the complex object format alone
would offer no solution. If it's about policy rather than format, then one
wonders whether a complex object format is really a minimal solution for the
datestamp problem. Put another way, should I adopt the overall complexity of
a complex object format to guarantee correctness of incremental resource
harvesting, or should I just introduce as much complexity as needed for the
problem and retain the low costs of a DC-based solution for the rest?

Any comment appreciated,

f

It depends on how your CO is constructed.  For example, if your CO
provides the following datastreams by-value:

        MARC + TIFFs + OCR + PDF

and you change your MARC -> DC mapping, then the changes will be
limited to oai_dc records and not oai_didl, saving you the penalty
of downloading the large CO.  However, if you change your MARC in
the above example, you will download the entire CO again.  Also,
if you edit any of TIFFs _or_ your OCR _or_ your PDF you will
download the entire CO again. The reason is that the OAI-PMH only
knows a single datastamp, and that is the datetime of creation /
modification of the digital object as a whole.  as soon as one of
the constituent datastreams MARC, TIFF, OCR, PDF) changes, the
datestamp of the object changes.

Having said that, one can imagine optimizations that would combine
OAI-PMH semantics and semantics _outside_ of the OAI-PMH.  For
example, imagine that:

(*) the CO that represents our digital object provides all its
datastreams by-reference (instead of by-value)

(*) we insert metadata into the CO that expresses the datetime of
creation/modification of each constituent datastream.

Both can be achieved using a decent CO format.  In this scenario,
the OAI-PMH datestamp of the CO triggers reharvest of a very
lightweight CO every time a constituent datastream changes.
Introspection of the harvested CO would reveal the creation /
modification datetime of each constituent datastream, and based
upon this, a decision can be made whether or not to collect the
datastreams that were provided by-reference.  This would be the
scenario:

1.  We do verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_didl&from=2005-01-01

2.  Record1 is the only match

3.  We examine Record1 to find:

Record1 (all datastreams are by-ref):
         - MARC (2005-01-30)
         - OCR (2005-01-25)
         - TIFF1 .. TIFFN (2003-07-23)
         - PDF (2003-07-23)

4. We can now decide to only dereference the MARC and OCR.

There are three problems:

1.  This introduces new, potentially confusing semantics for DC
(and MARC, etc.) and OAI-PMH.  If a "regular" harvester downloads
a DC record that says it has changed on 2004-12-23, and it is bit
equivalent with a the same record that last had a datestamp of
2003-02-21 -- what would that mean exactly?

2.  Related to the above, you would have to convey to harvesters
that you "do" or "do not" adhere to "DC-update means resource updates"
policy.  This could be done with a <description> container in an
Identify response, but this would likely be community-specific and
hard to generalize.

3.  You still need to convey how to "grab all the stuff".  In the
CO example above, the value in DC.Identifier is probably just a
"splash page"; how to grab the MARC, OCR, TIFFs, PDF etc. is not
easily conveyed in a generalizable manner.

In summary, chosing a sufficiently rich CO format will prevent
the above problems and ambiguities.

thanks for the exhaustive reply.
here are some further comments.

I am afraid I don't follow here. if DC is not in the CO example, how does
the change to the MARC->DC mapping relate to our discussion on CO support
for avoiding redundant harvesting? the assumption for that discussion is
that there is some metadata-only change to the CO, right?

indeed. that's exactly why I had the impression COs could well amplify the
problem of redundancy rather than solving it: changes to the 'metadata
parts' (MARC above) would force redundant harvesting of all 'content parts'
which are included by-value, whether the DIDL harvester planned to harvest
those resources or not.

> Having said that, one can imagine optimizations that would combine OAI-PMH
semantics and semantics _outside_ of the OAI-PMH.  For example, imagine

sure. but what does that imply? seems to me we have eliminated what
distinguishes COs from 'simple' metadata records (the included content,
perhaps dynamically generated, perhaps not Web-accessible) and we've added
conventions/extensions to the use of CO formats at both ends of the data
exchange. this is certainly an option, but had we not started with wanting
to avoid conventional/extended use of formats in the first place? put
another way, why not add datestamps to dc.format and have harvesters inspect
those instead? wouldn't it be in fact a simpler proposition to present to
those harvester which have an interest in resorce harvesting and are
currently DC-based? 

In any case, note that the 'redundant harvesting' issue requires a
commitment from DPs to report resource changes, and that this commitment is
not only outside the scope of OAI-PMH, but also outside the scope of CO
formats as such. Multiple datestamps have to be mantained and their changes
have to be reported, and this follows from policy not, say, DIDL.

sorry, I did not make the context sufficiently clear. I was trying to point
out that (i) there is little in the definitional 'complexity' of CO formats
(i.e. the fact that they include content representations) which directly
solves the datastamps problems (redundant and incomplete harvesting), and
that (ii) a solution relies on DP policy and on a format which might expose
that policy to interested harvesters. 
As to the format, the comparison is thus between an ad-hoc DC extension and
a CO format, say DIDL. Whichever you go for, questions 1) and 2) admit the
same answers. For example, plain-DC harvesters should see 'cloned' records
no more than they should se DIDL records and no more that plain-DIDL
harvesters (use DIDL but don't care for resource harvesting) should see
'cloned' DIDL objects which *refer* to an updated PDF without including it.
They will not be asking for them and they will not be given any.
In both cases, we have got two communities of adoption, DC and DIDL, and a
set of conventions/extensions proposed to support a particular usage:
resource harvesting. To the members within the community which do not
follow/interpret those conventions, the 'clone' record cannot be explained
(not that it would be noticed, or harmful at that); to those who do,
however, it means what they agreed it should mean, that resources referred
to by the data have changed and should be re-harvested. 
If we instead assume that DIDL harvesters are by definition aware of the
conventions specific to resource harvesting via the OAI-PMH, wouldn't we
also deny that DIDL is a 'strong standard' and thus lose the obvious reason
to prefer it over some newly convened-upon DC extension?

> 3.  You still need to convey how to "grab all the stuff".  In the CO

sure. my issues were with the datestamp part of the argument, i.e. the
'locate resource change' part. again, my doubt was on the inherent virtues
of COs to solve datastamp-related problems of resource harvesting.

as to the 'locate resource' part of the argument, I agree that it would be
good thing if DPs converged towards a potentially strong standard as they
show will to cooperate towards the particular requirements of resource
harvesting. In this sense, it would be interesting to gauge the cost of
adopting a CO, say DIDL, within the infrastructure of the existing OAI
community (both server and client sides costs of course) and then to compare
that cost with that associated with a convened-upon DC extension or, at
that, with the cost associated with an ad-hoc protocol extension blessed by
the OAI for the purpose. For example, one might argue that a protocol
extension would talk to the same interested parties a CO format or DC
extension would. It would work smoothly with existing exchange formats,
orthogonally addressing directly the redundant and incomplete harvesting
problems. Further, it would not require that resources be Web-accessible to
be harvested. 

your paper, thoroughly enjoyable and insightful otherwise, does not seem to
address these cost issues and comparisons directly. Initially, I got the
impression COs would solve the problems of resource harvesting by virtue of
their definitional properties. seems to me the argument is all but
technical, for it has to do with growing a community around a strong
standard which *may* nonetheless prove relatively cheap to adopt wrt to the
alternatives. but does it?

hi,
I don't think this has been directly brought up before on the list
(apologies otherwise).

When writing up about the protocol's exchange model, I found myself
wondering about the *necessity* of the item-resource distinction, which is
otherwise very clear. Given that the unit of exchange remains the metadata
record, what design considerations suggested to identify full abstract
descriptions of resources rather than the resources themselves? IOW, as a
data provider or aggregator, what problems do I incur into by reading a
getrecord request as one for a record in a given format about a resource
with a given identifier? Isn't it indeed the case that DPs at the edge of
the OAI network generate/map OAI identifiers from internal resource
identifiers? As I wonder how the relationship item-resource could not
possibly be one-to-one, the question seems at least licit. Perhaps I am
missing something obvious here. Any suggestion?

cheers,

Hi,

I think the idea with this distinction is that there may be multiple items
that disseminate different assertions (but in the same metadataFormat) about
the same resource.  Example: Bob's item about the resource http://w3.org/
says the dc:title is "The W3C", and Cindy's items says the dc:title is "The
homepage of the W3C".

that makes sense, of course. thanks. is there anyone 'using' the distinction
in that sense? since we're at it, how common is it for datestamps to be
actually attached to records, as per specs?  iow, who's keeping persistent
records in different formats and allow the latter to change independently
from items and each other? Aggregators? What class of changes are record-
but not item-dependent, btw? 
 
thanks,

Fabio,

LC, in providing access to digital reproductions of content in its
collections does find the 3-level distinction useful -- even if the
OAI terminology is not intuitive to my colleagues.

In LC's lcoa1 data provider, most of the "items" are essentially master
descriptive records in the MARC format.  The OAI "records" are generated
on the fly from those master records.  Recently, we changed the MARC to DC
transformation.  We changed the datestamp on all the virtual oai_dc
records when we changed the transformation, but the marc21 and mods
records have earlier datestamps.  The marc21 datestamps will correspond to
the last time the underlying MARC record was changed in the OAI
repository.  A mods record timestamp may correspond to the last update to
the underlying "item" or the date we last changed the MARC to MODS
transformation.  We maintain datestamps for OAI records even though the
records do not actually exist.

These 'items' (master descriptive records) are maintained independently of
the resources they describe.  In the oai_dc records, the significant
attributes (dc:date, dc:creator, etc.) usually relate to a physical
original which hasn't changed since it was created (usually before 1923
for copyright reasons and maybe many centuries before that) and the fact
that it was digitized by the Library of Congress is of secondary
importance for discovery.

That may provide an example of why the distinction is made for OAI.  
It certainly doesn't mean that every implementation needs to make use of
the distinction.  If the master metadata for your OAI implmentation is
embedded into the resources, for example, it would make little sense to
distinguish item from resource.

> What class of changes are record- but not item-dependent, btw?

if someone running a harvester wanted us to specify something more or
something differently, and we could comply, we would. the datestamp
would then serve as an indication to the harvester that we had made
the change(s), and which records had changed. in our case, this would
typically affect dc_qual and not oai_dc, so dc_qual would change
independently of oai_dc and of the items (to go back to the first
question).

> we are.

good, yours is example number 2 I've gathered, after Library of Congress. 
I suppose you also generate the different formats on the fly rather than
actually store persistent versions, right? That is, I assume that, for each
item, you only persist record datestamps for each format you disseminate,
along with a master record datestamp (like Library of Congress), is this
correct? And also that every time you actually change the item/master-record
-- in the day-to-day operation of your repository -- you also update all the
datestamps you are maintain. 
In any case, you're doing this to potentially avoid SPs having to repeat a
historical harvest of records which have not actually changed but appear to
have because a mapping of the master record onto another format -- say a
newly adopted format of no relevance to old SPs -- has. Is this also
correct? 
>From a repository-centric perspective, this seems to me quite a service you
do to SPs and the OAI-PMH. I find it interesting for it shows that, even
within the OAI-PMH, some service costs may be absorbed by DPs rather than
SPs. 

I wonder now if DP could be as good-willed as you are and yet avoid the
bookkeeping you are doing by: 
(i) avoid updating the item/master-record datestamp when a format mapping
changes, and 
(ii) use out-of-band techniques to tell harvester which are interested in
the mapping change that, as a result of that change, they should do a
historical re-harvest. 

All the other harvester would still be spared from doing costly and yet
irrelevant historical harvests. Of course, this requires DPs to know who's
harvesting them and for what. 

So, at least 4 possible scenario for DPs:

1) only one dissemination format: don't bother and attach datestamps to
items/master-records.
2) many dissemination formats: bother and keep/mantain datestamps for each
format disseminated.
3) many dissemination formats: bother, attach datestamps to
items/master-records, and tell only some harvesters to re-harvest in case of
per-format change.
4) many dissemination formats: don't' bother (and be evil)

Any comments appreciated.

fabio

I don't understand why oob techniques would be required.  If a repo
exposes metadata formats:

	- xyz (native)
	- abc (dynamically generated from xyz)

it is easy for the repo to associate a datestamp with the mapping itself
("from" shown):

foreach $record (@records) {
  if ($request->format eq "abc") {
    if ( ($request->datestamp < $record->datestamp) ||
         ($request->datestamp < $map_to_abc->datestamp) ) {
           push(@result, $record);
    }
  }
  if ($request->format eq "xyz") {
    if ($request->datestamp < $record->datestamp) {
      push(@result, $record);
    }
  }
}

a new mapping of xyz->abc will not impact xyz harvesters, and keeping the
datestamp with the mapping function doesn't represent a hardship for the
repo.

Michael

absolutely yes! much better. I can now make sense of the following excerpt
from Section 3 of the Implementation Guidelines:

"The datestamp values used for OAI are for the purpose of incremental
harvesting. They should be changed to reflect any change in the item which
includes any change to any of the disseminations. For example, even if the
underlying master-record within a repository is not changed, a change to the
way that some formats are generated on the fly should result in updates to
the datestamps of all items for which that format may be disseminated. One
way that this may be implemented internally when building a datestamp index
is:

if (internalItemDatestamp > disseminationInterfaceDatestamp) {
  datestamp = internalItemDatestamp
} else {
  datestamp = disseminationInterfaceDatestamp
}"

which I tended to find a bit obscure. many thanks indeed.

fabio

we precompute the metadata portion of the OAI response for all
metadata formats we support. we generate the rest of the response,
including the datestamp, on the fly from a record in our
database. this record also contains a pointer to the precomputed
portion.

yes.

no, but only because we don't disseminate master records via
OAI. however, we know what that datestamp would be, so if it were ever
to change, then ...

yes.

if we were to add a new format, the records for the new format would
get a datestamp more recent than that for any of our other formats,
because we'd want the harvesters to pick them up. the records for the
old formats would not receive a new datestamp, because nothing about
them would have changed.

hi,

I'm trying to test and validate a static repository file. I followed the
guidelines at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm.

while testing/validating it, I get errors: e.g. with the explorer
at
http://re.cs.uct.ac.za/cgi-bin/Explorer/2.0-1.46/testoai?archive=http://oai.ask23.de/static/ask23-oai.edit.xml
(as proposed by http://www.language-archives.org/sr ) or with the
Experimental OAI Static Repository Gateway at http://libtest.lanl.gov/

okay, that indicates, that there's something wrong with the xml. but: if
I use other static repository files to validate, e.g. the sample at the
OAI guidelines or the sample given at http://libtest.lanl.gov/vb1.xml, I
get the same errors.

funny. so what's wrong? the xml files or the explorer and validators?

thanx in advance, ulf

Hi Ulf,

Did you register your file at a Static Repository Gateway?
A Static Repository file by itself is not a valid OAI repository,
it needs a gateway to respond to all OAI verbs. There are several
to accomplish this: register at a gateway of your community
e.g. OLAC, register at a demonstration gateway at http://libtest.lanl.gov/
or try to install/implement a gateway yourself (see e.g. 
http://srepod.sourceforge.net for a implementation).

KR,

Patrick

It seems that the repository you mention does not respond the requests via
the HTTP POST method correctly, although HTTP GET works OK.
