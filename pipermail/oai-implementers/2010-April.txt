Message-ID: <4BC5E6DC.1050308@proescholdt.de>

Hello,

the XMLSchema at http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/OAI-PMH.xsd 
requires strict validation for the content of <setDescription> in a 
reply to a ListSets request, while allowing arbitrary namespaces.

I'm wondering how one goes about validating such XML. It is clear that 
one would validate against OAI-PMH.xsd, but in order to validate the
content of <setDescription> one would also have to load the 
corresponding XMLschema. Since the namespace can be anything it can 
obviously not be imported into OAI-PMH.xsd.
Is one supposed to fetch the XMLschema from the supplied schemaLocation
before validating?

The background of my question is that I'm tracking interoperability 
issues between two OAI implementations. (joai,genoetwork). joai returns 
the attached reply, which does not validate against OAI-PMH.xsd.

any hints would be very much appreciated
thanks
Timo

hi Tim

it seems there is a small error in the specification of the XML schema 
in joai. the setDescription's dc tag needs to have an absolute URL for 
the oai_dc schema in schemaLocation, namely:

   xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/
                       http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"

once that is fixed, it validates without a hitch.

ttfn,
----hussein

Tim,

jOAI does provide an absolute URL for the oai_dc schema in the
schemaLocation, but the example you attached does not.

For example, here's a ListSets response from the DLESE jOAI instance:
http://www.dlese.org/oai/provider?verb=ListSets

The Xerces validator that comes with jOAI shows it as valid:
http://www.dlese.org/oai/provider?verb=Identify&rt=validate

Could it be that the schemaLocation is being changed somewhere in your
processing?

hi and thanks,


did you import the oai_dc.xsd in the OAI-PMH.xsd? I can only get the
jOAI response to validate if I add the oai-dc XMLschema to OAI-PMH.xsd using

	<import namespace="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" 
schemaLocation="oai_dc.xsd"/>


This is fine for this purpose here, but I'm wondering what a generic 
solution would look like. Since any namespace can occur inside 
<setDescription> I cannot import them all in OAI-PMH.xsd.

thanks
Timo


P.S the incorrect xml doc in my email as due to my messing around with 
the code. jOI does of course provide correct xml.

Timo,

You might try a different tool for validation. Many tools will
automatically fetch all schemas that are referenced in the instance
document and apply them to the element on which they appear.

A number of validation tools are listed here, although this list is a bit
old:
http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema

Best,

 - john
