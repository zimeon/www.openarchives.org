Subject: [OAI-implementers] Release of OAI rights specification
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0505032059130.22530@dhcp103-124.cs.cornell.edu>


We are pleased to announce the release of guidelines for conveying rights
expressions about metadata in the OAI-PMH framework:
  http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-rights.htm

The guidelines specify a mechanism for including rights expressions that
pertain to the contents of the <metadata> parts of records in OAI-PMH
responses. No new rights expression language has been created. Instead,
the specification provides a mechanism to include existing and future XML
rights expressions. Description of rights expressions associated with set
and repository aggregations is supported through manifests of rights
expressions in set and repository descriptions. The design has been guided
by the need for simple and clear semantics that will allow
service-providers to make harvesting and use decisions based on these
rights expressions.

The guidelines were developed by the OAI-rights effort initiated in
collaboration with project RoMEO, and have benefited from the broad
experience of a number of contributors:

A somewhat late response to this thread...

I think that they key to avoiding sets being misused as a poor man's
search is education. We must keep repeating the mantra that this is not
what OAI-PMH was designed to do and if search is desired then SRU/SRW or
similar should be used. Shirley Hyatt and Jeff Young have demonstrated
OAI-PMH and SRU/SRW playing nicely together at OCLC
(http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march05/hyatt/03hyatt.html)

The problem of items moving out of sets is a real one, and one we need to
address within the protocol.

Having said this, there may be situations where Robert's suggestion makes
sense. However, just as with sets, I suspect deployment should be
judicious -- to meet real selective harvesting needs.  I note that one
additional requirement for implementation is that items MUST be identified
using a recognized global URI scheme. Unless that is the case then
harvesters should assume that ids within OAI-PMH responses are local, and
then multiple repositories with the same content would be confusing.

Cheers,
Simeon

Hi,

a 3rd party would like to consider extensions of the oai:recordType
component of the protocol's schema in order to disclose per-record
information other than and in addition to descriptive metadata (say
contained in a <foo> element following the <metadata> element). The extra
information is optional, in that standard OAI requests simply do not trigger
its generation; accordingly, the party would very much like this kind of
extension to be backword-compatible, so that a single implementation of the
extended server would equally serve old and new clients of the protocol.
Conceptually such an extension *is* backword-compatible but the protocol's
schema does not cater for it (why?). The 3rd party must either extend within
the OAI namespace, which it does not own (apparently a bad practice even
when technically harmless) or else extend into a new namespace and accept to
break all namespace-aware old clients. Is this correct and, in case, is
there a way around it? Or must the 3rd party admit that standard and
extended implementations of the protol must live (and be maintained) side by
side at two different URLs? 

regards,

fabio

Fabio,

I am not sure I understand your question correctly, but assuming I do, here are 
the ways to achieve what I think you want to achieve without having to extend 
the protocol:

(*) Introduce an extra harvestable metadata format - <bar> - that encapsulates 
the "normal" one and the "additional" one (note that using XML Schema, the 
nature of the additional one can be defined in an open-ended manner : any 
namespace ...)

<metadata>
<bar>
<dc/>
<foo/>
</bar>
</metadata>

(*) If the "additional" stuff is metadata about the "normal" stuff then put it 
in an "about" container

cheers

Herbert,

the 'additional' stuff is indeed about items, not their metadata (so outside
the <about> container). 
Defining a new metadata format does not seem satisfactory, because it either

1) freezes the format of both 'normal' and 'additional' stuff, and I am
after a general, application-independent mechanism.
2) does not mandate either (is a container) but consumes the possibility of
specifying precise formats for 'normal' and 'additional' stuff.

To rephrase, a harvester may want any combination of formats for both
metadata and extra stuff and I'm after mechanism that does not rely on the
standardisation of specific combinations of 'normal' and 'additional' stuff
(say DC&add1, MARC&add2, DC&add3, MARC&add1, ....). I'd rather having the
two parts to be standardised separately and combined on a per-request basis.


cheers,

fabio

Fabio,

I guess you may want to look at complex object formats such as MPEG-21 DIDL and 
METS, which natively allow you to "wrap" lots of things.

See, for example, http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december04/vandesompel/12vandesompel.html

Subject: [OAI-implementers] W3C Workshop on XML Schema 1.0 User Experiences
Message-ID: <20050513150426.GD2683@openlib.org>


  Given the dependency of OAI on XML Schema, I hope this will be 
  of interest to many here. Lobbying for what the OAI community
  needs from Schema will be much welcome. 


  Cheers,

			CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

	   W3C Workshop on XML Schema 1.0 User Experiences


The W3C is organizing a Workshop on XML Schema 1.0 User Experiences to
gather concrete reports of user experience with XML Schema 1.0, and
examine the full range of usability, implementation, and
interoperability problems around the specification and its test suite.

  When:  21-22 June 2005
  Where: Oracle Conference Center, Redwood Shores, CA, USA

The full Call for Participation is available at:

     http://www.w3.org/2005/03/xml-schema-user-cfp

   20 May 2005:  Experience reports due
   6 June 2005:  Program available
   10 June 2005: Registration closes
                 (N.B. registration will close earlier if full)

  - To ensure maximum diversity among participants, the number of
    participants per organization will be limited to two individuals.
  - There is no registration fee.

-----------------
Workshop Overview
-----------------

  This workshop will gather concrete reports of user experience with
  XML Schema 1.0, and examine the full range of usability,
  implementation, and interoperability problems around the
  specification and its test suite. Topics of discussion include, but
  are not limited to, the use of XML Schema in vocabulary design, Web
  Services description and toolkits, XHTML, XML Query, and XML Schema
  editors.

  Expected participants include schema authors, authors or users of
  public or standard schemas, developers and vendors of schema-aware
  code generators, schema-aware middleware, schema validators, or
  other schema-related software, and the W3C XML Schema Working Group.

  Desired outcomes of the workshop include:
  * A plan of action for addressing existing interoperability issues
    connected with XML Schema 1.0.
  * A plan of action for addressing existing problems with XML Schema
    1.0 through errata and clarifications.

  Attendees are encouraged to bring (or provide in advance, in their
  user experience reports):
  * Use cases and proposed guidelines to address them using XML
    Schema.
  * Tests (or real schemas) with interoperability issues, whether the
    issues are due to a lack of clarity of the XML Schema
    specification or to discrepancies in the implementations.

We look forward to your participation and contributions to this
workshop.
