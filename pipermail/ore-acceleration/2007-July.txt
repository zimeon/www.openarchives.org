Hi all:

 

My guess is that people "registered" for the blog but didn't "subscribe".  So
please do the following as soon as possible:

 

1.        Go to http://ore.blogging.com/

2.       Login under your user name and password

3.       Click on "My Preferences" in the upper right menu

4.       In the "Notification" section select "For all articles" for both
"Receive article email notices" and "Receive comment email notices"

 

Also you can syndicate the feed from the link on the blog home page.

 

Let me know if you have any problems.

 

Carl

Hi all:

 

I've jump started the blog with a post.  Those of you subscribed have gotten
notifications.  Those not subscribed (I know who you are!) are missing the
action ;-)

 

I've also added an "essential readings" list on the blog page.  These are
what I consider documents essential for preparation for the August meeting.
I'd like to keep this as the absolutely essential list. Your suggestions are
welcome.

 

Carl

All,

Perhaps you've recvd email notices when the blog has been updated, but I
don't think I have.  Herbert drew my attention to some recent posts (he
had not recvd notices either).  I just posted 2 comments and only recvd an
update for 1.

fyi,

Michael
