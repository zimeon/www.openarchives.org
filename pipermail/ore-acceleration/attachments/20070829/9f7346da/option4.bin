\f0\fs24 \cf0 1.       A Resource map (Rem) is a resource that identifies and describes an aggregation of resources\
\
2.       URI-Rem is:\
\
a.       The identity for linking, citing, making assertions about the aggregation of resources  as a whole.\
\
b.      The URI from which a Rem (serialization) is obtained\
\
c.       MUST exist and MUST  be protocol-based\
\
3.	The Resource map (serialization)\
\
a.       MUST include a Manifest (Man)\
\
b.      MAY include types and relationships\
\
4.       A resource that is aggregated by the Rem is called a Target resource (Tre)\
\
a.       A Tre MUST be included in the Man of a Rem \
\
5.       URI-Tre is:\
\
a.       The identity of a Tre, unchanged from its \'d2original identity\'d3\
\
b.      MUST exist and MUST  be protocol-based\
\
c.       Is what is included in the manifest and in all assertions in the Rem (typing, relationships)\
\
 i.      Understanding is that all these are contextualized assertions about Tres, in the context of the Rem\
\
d.      The identity for linking, citing, making assertions about the Tre as a standalone object.\
\
6.       An "O" resource (resource) is a resource that identifies and describes a surrogate for a Tre; the "O" resource (Ore) is a surrogate for the Tre in the sense that it is a "stand-in" for the Tre in the context of the aggregation of resources that is identified and described by the Rem. \
\
7.       An "O"  resource (serialization) is a description of a "O" resource (resource).\
\
a.	The description includes  the original URI-Tre  with a \'d2ball of URI-R context\'d3 around it.  Probably s/t like:\
\
 i.      The id URI-Tre\
\
 ii.      The id URI-Rem\
\
 iii.      Possible metadata\
\
8.       URI-Ore is:\
\
a.       The identity of  the "O" resource.\
\
b.      A surrogate URI for a corresponding URI-Tre\
\
 i.      SHOULD be the linking, citing, making assertions about the Tre as a contextualized resource\
\
c.       MUST be protocol-based\
\
 i.      MUST provide access to the "O" resource (serialization)\
\
d.      SHOULD be explicitly  defined and resolved by the author of the Rem\
\
 i.      In which case clients MUST use it for citation of contextualized resource.\
\
e.      MAY, if not  explicitly defined ,be inferred by the client via protocol-defined mechanisms.\
