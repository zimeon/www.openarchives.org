<PRE>Dear All,

I have just joined this list, as part of my own 
strategy in getting started with OAI. My main interest 
in knowing about OAI is to be able to provide Brazilian 
researchers from the social sciences and humanities 
with OAI facilities. It is actually part of a research 
project in which I have worked over the last few days. 
I will therefore, be highly interested in exchange 
ideas and receiving suggestions on this.


</PRE>
