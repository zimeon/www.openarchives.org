<PRE>Hi,

I have just jointed this list and my main aim is to get 
started with OAI information. I have recently become 
involved in a R&amp;D project which aims to provide 
Brazilian academic researhcers from the social sciences 
and humanities with OAI facilities, amongst a few other 
resources. Therefore, I have the expectation of, joing 
th elist, I could be well-informed about OAI, and also 
could both exchange ideas and receiving suggestions 
from now on.

</PRE>
