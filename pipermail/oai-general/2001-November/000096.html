*** CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ***

	Museums and the Web 2002
	April 17 -20, 2002
	Boston, Massachusetts, USA
	<A HREF="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2002/">http://www.archimuse.com/mw2002/</A>

Deadline: November 30, 2001.

Thousands of cultural heritage institutions are now on-line, 
presenting programs, creating communities and delivering information 
using the world wide web. But museums, libraries, archives and others 
involved in creating digital heritage have much to learn about what 
makes web sites successful. To facilitate this exchange of 
information, Archives &amp; Museum Informatics organizes an annual 
international conference devoted exclusively to Museums and the Web. 
Since the first Museums and the Web in 1997, the conference has grown 
steadily to become the largest gathering of cultural heritage 
technologists world-wide.

You are invited to play a role at Museums and the Web 2002. Deliver a 
paper, demonstrate your site, host an on-line activity, orchestrate 
an event or present a workshop the program is made up from 
suggestions by professionals like you!

Full details and on-line proposal submission are available at 
<A HREF="http://www.archimuse.com/mw2002/">http://www.archimuse.com/mw2002/</A>

The MW2002 program addresses Web-related issues for museums, 
archives, libraries and other cultural institutions. Participants are 
selected by the Program Committee, based on the quality of their 
proposal and their previous work.  The Deadline for Proposals is 
November 30, 2001. Watch for the Preliminary Program on-line in 
January, 2002.

Accepted speakers must write full papers for the MW2002 Proceedings, 
available to all registrants at the conference, and published 
pre-conference on the Web. Others may write papers if they wish. All 
papers are due February 15, 2002.

Conference Papers are on-line for all previous Museums and the Web 
conferences. See <A HREF="http://www.archimuse.com/mw.html">http://www.archimuse.com/mw.html</A> for links. Printed 
proceedings (with an accompanying CD-ROM) are also available.

Web. If you would like to receive the Preliminary Program, please
