Subject: [OAI-general] Draft Response -- Kepler: Author-Based Archivelets
Message-ID: <OFF7A1B2E7.A05186F0-ON85256A64.0042F218@cs.odu.edu>

Deat Stevan,

Thanks for you  assessment about the Kepler. One aspect, which we may not
have made it very clear in our paper directly relates to the concerns you
have raised. We envision Kepler framework to be deployed to support
different communities, where a community would provide the required
functionality via its service provider. For example, it is possible to have
a technical report community that uses the Kepler framework to provide
various high level services including long term preservation function.
This typically would be provided by the community service provider, which
will keep a copy of the technical reports published by individual
publishers. In fact, on one end of the spectrum you can treat  Kepler
archivelet as nothing but a publishing tool for a given community or an
institution.  I hope this clarifies some of your concerns.


Regards,

Zubair

As far as I can tell (and I hope my more technical colleagues will be
able to confirm or correct this), Kepler is a kind of smaller-scale
eprints.org archive-maker. It too creates an (OAI-compliant?)
archive, but at the individual rather than the institutional level.

As such, if it works and is robust, it is more than welcome! It can
contribute to the freeing of the refereed literature.

Only three things worry me about Kepler.

(1) It looks like it is appealing to authors to SELF-PUBLISH (rather
than merely to self-archive their research, pre- and post-publication).
This "vanity press" motivation is, in my opinion, at odds with the
self-archiving intiative, whose primary goal is to free the refereed
journal literature on-line.

(2) One advantage of institutional rather than individual archives is
that it puts the long-term preservation function into stronger and more
durable hands. Can individuals promise this same reliability?

(3) The association with Napster is not a confidence-enhancing
one...
september98-forum@amsci-forum.amsci.org

But the proof of the pudding is in the eating. If the Kepler software
works, and is robust, reliable and lasting, then I certainly hope
authors will use it, and register and maintain their archives at OAI.

"Peer Review" and "Preservation" are high on the list of prima facie
worries that are retarding self-archiving. It is very important that
our efforts refute rather reinforce such worries...

ACM SIGIR 2001 WORKSHOP

ON

OPEN ARCHIVES:  COMMUNITIES, INTEROPERABILITY, AND SERVICES

New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.A.
September 13, 2001


OBJECTIVE

This workshop aims to promote interoperability among open archives and
digital libraries. It will help in the building of (1) services to support
such interoperability, and (2) communities interested in working together to
share information.

This workshop will allow those involved in the Open Archives Initiative
(OAI, www.openarchives.org), and those wishing to become involved, to extend
the Initiative through (a) sharing of technology, (b) description and
demonstration of services, and (c) community-based discussion of conventions
that ensure interoperability. Groups of people interested in applying OAI
through collaborative, federated, and distributed activities are encouraged
to use this workshop as a way to plan their future coordinated work in
connection with OAI. 


TOPICS OF INTEREST

In general, this workshop will include an introduction to OAI and provide
technology sharing and community building opportunities. With regard to OAI
and related technology, the following topics will be discussed:
* OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting 
* Interoperability needs of individual communities 
* Building cross-archive services 
* Creating standards to support community-wide services 
* Evaluation of the work done thus far 
* Research issues 
* Organization of the OAI 
* Future directions of the OAI

Part of the workshop will be devoted to group discussions. Some may focus on
some of the above mentioned topics. But it is expected that most groups will
represent various communities. Thus grouping may be based on genre, e.g.,
those working with: educational resources, preprint services, technical
reports, electronic theses and dissertations. Other groupings may be based
on discipline, e.g., physics, chemistry, computing, information retrieval.


WORKSHOP CHAIRS
Edward A. Fox (Chair), Virginia Tech (member of OAI Steering Committee)
Hussein Suleman (Co-Chair), Virginia Tech (member of OAI Technical
Committee)


PARTICIPATION

Expected audience: Archivists, librarians, publishers, researchers and
representatives of user communities with an interest in interoperability of
digital library systems and the building of services to support user
communities.

This will be an open meeting with selection of participants based on
submissions to the Chairs giving:
* a one paragraph summary of prior or planned involvement in the Open
Archives Initiative;
* a position statement of not more than 1000 words (half on what a person
can contribute to the meeting topics and half on their background/prior
work);
* a list of others applying to attend with whom community discussions might
proceed (if known).

Submissions should be sent in ASCII or MS-Word form. All submissions will be
reviewed by the organizers. The position statements of invited participants
will be reproduced and distributed at the workshop.


CORRESPONDENCE

Please send all correspondence to both fox@vt.edu and hussein@vt.edu


IMPORTANT DATES

Submission (position statement):  July 16, 2001
Notification of acceptance:   July 31, 2001
Final submission (of revised position statement): August 15, 2001   
Workshop:     September 13, 2001


FURTHER INFORMATION

Background on OAI: The Open Archives Initiative develops and promotes
standards that aim to facilitate efficient dissemination of content. Its
goal is to to serve communities wishing to share any type of information by
ensuring interoperability and componentized, layered services. OAI was
launched in October 1999 to provide a forum to discuss and solve problems of
interoperability, initially among author self-archiving solutions. Now OAI
aims to support all archives, both those focused on e-prints (e.g.,
preprints and reprints, often connected with journals and conferences) and
those representing a wide variety of other content types (e.g., theses and
dissertations, Web log files, and educational resources). The emphasis has
been on allowing harvesting of metadata that describes diverse "records" of
content, stored in managed repositories.

Yes, this is the point. Users don't really care what format for meta-data a 
site is compliant with, but want some validation that the materials there 
are "peer reviewed".

It seems that from the point of view of a Google user, it doesn't matter 
whether they are compliant to your format or not, since Google will do its 
ordinary search.

What is the difference between "pre-refereeing" and "anything you want to 
stick on the web and claim it is being sent somewhere"?  I was assuming 
here that the point of having a special category was to have the effect of 
refereeing so you could trust the material more. I can't trust something 
because someone just says it is "pre-referee" and puts it on some site that 
uses some format.

Correct. And one of the eprints.org meta-data tags is "refereed" and
another is "journal-name". It is possible to restrict search to only
those papers that have the refereed tag ON.

But I think you missed my point about content. The biggest and oldest
of the Open Archives, the Physics Archive (arXiv.org) has 150,000
papers (tiny by google standards but huge, among scholarly/scientific
disciplines, relative to what is NOT thus freely available online).

Many people have said across the years that the Physics ArXiv will
need some sort of "certifier" (and conceivably some day it will).

But to date, it is totally unnecessary. Those preprints and postprints
are all SELF-CERTIFIED as such by their authors, and with virtually no
exceptions what they say is true. Why? Because this is an esoteric
literature, written BY researchers, FOR researchers -- for their peers
(the same peers who do the peer review). And there is simply no
motivation to cheat. (What would be the motivation?)

And I should add that although there is no certification, there IS
screening, to exclude the obvious frauds, like porn, weight-loss, or
just plain quackery. 

CogPrints (cogprints.soton.ac.uk), the Cognitive Sciences Archive, also
has this screening, and it too has virtually nothing in it but
bonafide preprints and postprints.

Some day some more rigorous screening may be needed, but for now, the
only real quality controller that we need is peer-review itself, and
that is already taking place (as most of the 150,000 preprints in the
Physics Archive turn into refereed, published postprints).

The right way to think of the literature in this special set of
interoperable archives (particularly with the refereed tag ON) is
as simply a free online version of what you would find behind the
firewalls of the publishers of these journals, for a fee. 

And my proposal is that google might create a sector, or a sub-engine,
that searches all and only this interoperable set of archives (with
referee tag ON if you like).

I think you are not contemplating the situation I have in mind:

Here is a current exact comparison. This is a google search on
"superstring" (which, by the way, is a term of art: I could have
picked much more awkward examples):

http://www.google.com/search?q=superstring&btnG=Google+Search

It returns 21,800 hits, the first 10 of which are not even
refereed journal articles (let alone all and only refereed
journal articles). I have no idea what most of those hits are,
but picking out the refereed articles from among them would be 
a long and tedious exercise -- and with a more awkward search term,
could become like finding a needle in a haystack. And the google-style
link-frequency metric is no help here.

But if you instead do the search with cite-base, which is restricted
to the OAI eprint Archives:

http://cite-base.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search

you get 1250 hits, every single one of them a preprint or postprint,
exactly as if you had done it in an indexing/abstracting database
devoted exclusively to the refereed physics literature. And you can the
hits ordered by author citation-impact, paper citation-impact, author
download-impact or paper download-impact.

What made me think of collaborating with google is that although you
might say: "Sounds like you've already got need you want there, with
cite-base!" the fact is that we still have the problem of CONTENT that
I mentioned.

Physics is doing relatively well, but even there, at the present linear
growth rate, it won't be till 2011 that that entire year's Physics
papers are all free online. And the other disciplines are much further
behind.

Google, with its wide usage for other purposes, if it implemented an
scientific/scholarly sub-engine along the lines we discussed, could
help attract all that content into the archives much much faster (while
establishing itself as the search engine for the refereed
literature).

The filtering is done by peer review. Then the authors self-certify
their own papers as peer-reviewed, and the archive screens for
relevance and quackery. At this time, that is definitely all that is
needed. If a day comes when there is so much content up there that it
is drawing in junk too, it will not be difficult to make the screening
more rigorous, both at the archive and the archive-registry level.

Let me add that the adopters of the eprints.org archive-creating
software are universities and research institutions. And they are
doing it to increase the visibility, accessibility and impact of
their refereed research. It is in their interests to screen out the
junk too.

But right now the main objective is to draw the (pre/postprint) content
into those archives!

Your expectation would be reasonable, if the actual evidence were not
exactly the contrary.

We don't need archives that "referee" preprints (those would simply
be online journals!). We need archives that make the refereed papers
available to everyone for free. As a bonus, there is also the
pre-refereeing stage of the papers -- but as always, the "caveat
emptor" rule prevails with unrefereed material.

But surely, before worrying that there might be a tremendous incentive
out there for researchers to falsely label their unrefereed preprints
as a "refereed postprints" (with what journal name/date, by the way?),
you should ask yourself what is to be gained by that? especially when
balanced against what there is to lose as soon as the obvious fraud is
exposed?

Best wishes,

Stevan

Yes, I agree, and this is why the physics archives have worked.  I don't 
think the approach will work as well in areas where there are commercial 
interests (e.g., computing technologies and medical cures) or ideological 
differences (e.g., the archaeological history of Palestine) and when a mass 
audience is present (people who aren't researchers but want to find a 
medical cure or buy a piece of technology).  The motivation to cheat will 
rear its ugly head..

Getting a mass search engine like Google involved ups the ante.  I think 
that having a separate portal for "scientific-scholarly" resources that 
don't have mass visibility may be better.  This might piggyback off of the 
Google database if that can be done effectively.

How about the simplest possible implementation - a search page that calls 
google and automatically adds the equivalent of "and ''oams' in meta tags" 
to the query.  Anyone can get a page included by putting this in the meta 
information, but as you say, we need to count on people not to cheat.  It 
doesn't enforce compliance with a standard, but does let them declare that 
something is scholarly/scientific.  It makes it a lot easier to get people 
to buy in, rather than persuading them to implement complex meta-data.

To cheat by pretending one's paper has appeared in a refereed journal
(which?) when it hasn't? How often do you think that might happen?
And what prevents the same person (with the same commercial
interests) from direct emailing of the bogus journal article, with a
bogus journal front-piece to the target audience. Where is the
edvantage of dropping it in an eprint archive?

Terry, this is all very new stuff. All kinds of possibilities enter
the imagination. It's important to sort the plausible ones from the
implausible ones before letting such thought-experiments govern our
behavioral strategies.

Maybe that's a way to do it, though I'm not sure what it entails. The
possibility I had (in my imagination) was simply a google button that
then restricts the google search only to the registered OAI-compliant
eprint archives, with "refereed" flag on...

An unscreened "oams" tag that anyone could use would really invite
abuse and would be self-defeating. It takes much more to set up an
OAI-compliant eprint archive, screen it, and register it with OAI than
simply to attach oams to all files. Besides, all the OAI-compliant
archives are interoperable, and google could trigger on their other
important tags, like "refereed" and "journal name".

It seems to me the registered set of OAI metadata tags is the critical
element here, not an arbitrary oams tag attachable to any file
(except if there were a way to get the "oams" tag authenticated -- but
that would be just re-inventing the OAI without the
interoperability!).

Hello

I've just had a play with Kepler and thought I'd share my thoughts. My 
comments are based on a brief experience and the technical report, but I'm 
sure Xiaoming Liu will correct me if I make technical errors about his 
software.

This is true, Kepler is VERY easy to download and use. It's well packaged for 
it's target platform (windows).

I take exception to this. Software that immediately `phones home' to a 
hard-wired registration server IS NOT PEER-2-PEER, it's just another tier in 
the client server model. To be peer-to-peer, Kepler would have to contact 
other user-level Kepler/OAI clients directly and exchange information about 
other Kepler/OAI clients.

This may be the intentions of Keplers builders, but since it contains no 
copyright release for mirroring, copying or distribution, the legal footing of 
such long-term preservation providers would be dubious.

Kepler is written in Java, so it could be restructured to run as part of a web 
server. This would, of course, require that the suer be running a web server 
and have the admin rights to change it's configuration, something not required 
for Kepler.

One of the key problems I see with Kepler is that there's little or no user 
education or encouragement to create and check accurate metadata. Documents 
with little or no meaningful metadata are going to be VERY hard to browse no 
matter how intelligent the Service Provider.

On the bright side, having a very-light-weight OAI implementation will make 
testing new implementations against it very easy.

Stuart,

I wanted to clarify on the "similarity" of Kepler framework with
peer-to-peer broker based model. The proposed Kepler  framework supports
two types of users: individual publishers using the archivelet publishing
tool and general users interested in retrieving published documents. The
individual publishers interact with the publishing tool and the general
users interact with a  service provider and an OAI compliant repository
using a browser. In a way, the extended OAI framework looks very similar to
a broker based peer-to-peer network model [Bob2000]. Typically a user is
both a data provider (using Kepler archivelet) and a discovery user (using
Browser) that accesses a service provider. Thus, the primary mode of
operation might be construed as one of exchanging documents. Note that a
user directly connects to a Kepler user, after getting information about
the document from the service provider,  for downloading the published
document.  You can view Web Browser + Kepler archivelet as a peer-to-peer
node of a broker based model, where Registration Service + Service Provider
can be viewed as the broker. Consider the following scenario: User 'A'
contacts the broker and query where can he get a specific document. Broker
sends a brief information about the document(s) of interest and also point
out the coordinates of the user "B", who has the document. User 'A" then
contacts user 'B' directly to download the document. I hope this clarifies.
In the end, I should mention  that we are not claiming that we are building
a peer-to-peer networking infrastructure. It so happens that we noticed
some similarity between the Kepler framework and the peer-to-peer broker
based model, and we thought of pointing it out in the report.

Subject: [OAI-general] Eprints works! Caltech registers two new repositories in OAI!
Message-ID: <0C2C50C9B668D311878100A0C9EA3676A70BC2@dungeon.library.caltech.edu>

It is my pleasure to announce that Caltech just registered two new
repositories with the Open Archives Initiative.

CAV 2001 is the conference proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium
on Cavitation.
CSTR is a repository of technical reports of the Caltech Computer Science
option.
Both repositories can be found at http://library.caltech.edu/digital

Beyond these two, we are also working on several other repositories: for the
Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative, for the Control and Dynamical
Systems option, for the Environmental Engineering option, etc. We are well
under way to deposit our first Electronic Thesis.

This has been a significant teamwork:

Caltech reference librarians are actively recruiting faculty into this new
publishing venture. Once faculty sign on, librarians handle most
document-management and metadata issues. For the repositories we just
registered, this work fell primarily on Kim Douglas (Director of the Sherman
Fairchild Library and Head of Technical Information Services) and Hema
Ramachandran (Reference Librarian). However, all librarians are getting
involved as they are signing up new options.

Kim worked with Adam Cochran (Caltech's Intellectual Property Counsel) on
copyright issues. Authors who deposit material in our repositories retain
copyright, but grant a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to Caltech. (See
http://cav2001.library.caltech.edu/permission.html for details.) Of course,
Caltech makes this material available for free. (See
http://cav2001.library.caltech.edu/copyright.html for details.)

The technical aspects are taken care of by the Library Information
Technology group members Ed Sponsler and Betsy Coles. Ed focuses on Eprints
and Betsy on ETDs. Both work closely together, and both support our
librarians as they learn to conquer all the document-management issues
related to these projects.

All of the above would not have been possible without the Eprints software.
Without Eprints, we would still be in the software-development stage.
Instead, we could focus on the development of a service. We owe a great debt
to Stevan Harnad and his group for their contribution to the scholarly
community.

                  and Metadata Applications 2001

                   http://www.nii.ac.jp/dc2001/

Date:       22 - 26 October 2001
Venue:      National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan
Sponsors:   National Institute of Informatics (NII, http://www.nii.ac.jp/)
            Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI, http://dublincore.org/)
            Japan Science and Technology Corporation 
            (JST, http://www.jst.go.jp/EN/)

Providing machine-understandable data on the Web has become a priority
not just for publishers and scientific communities, but for a wide
range of commercial ventures and services.  Resource discovery across a
diversity of services on the emerging Semantic Web is facilitated by
the use of shared metadata vocabularies such as the Dublin Core
Metadata Element Set.

The Dublin Core workshop series has provided a forum for international,
cross-disciplinary metadata development since 1995.  DC-2001, ninth in
this series, will include an international conference for the broader
metadata community with three principal missions:

-- to provide a forum to discuss further development of the Dublin Core
   and related metadata standards

-- to provide a forum to present and exchange new ideas about metadata
   and applications, not limited to Dublin Core, and

-- to provide tutorials on the creation, management, and use of
   metadata applications.

DC-2001 is the first event in the DC Workshop series to be hosted in
Asia and is also the first event to include conference and tutorial
tracks in addition to the workshop.

The Conference track of DC-2001 (Wednesday-Friday, 24-26 October)
invites submissions of papers in the following areas:

-- Conceptual models for metadata
-- Implementation of systems and tools for metadata applications
-- Surveys and case studies of metadata applications
-- Novel activities based on metadata
-- Interoperability among metadata systems
-- Relationships among various metadata standards

The Workshop track (Monday-Wednesday, 22-24 October), will feature
technical meetings of ongoing working groups of the Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative.  The agenda for the workshop track is under
development in DCMI Working Groups.  All active members of working
groups, and others who would like to become active, are invited to
participate.

Deadlines

  Paper Submission:             20 June 2001

Dear all,
Sara Bertocco, from SISSA, wrote an article about Torii. You'll find it in
the last issue of our HEP Libraries Webzine, released about 20 minutes
ago...
http://library.cern.ch/HEPLW/

The new issue is mainly dedicated to open archiving and some related
issues:

1- How and Why To Free All Refereed Research From Access- and
Impact-Barriers  Online, Now - Stevan Harnad, Les Carr, Tim Brody

2- Distributed Information Services in Physics - E. Hilf, M. Hohlfeld, T.
Severiens, K. Zimmermann

3- Exposing and Harvesting Metadata Using the OAI Metadata Harvesting
Protocol: A Tutorial -  Simeon Warner

The tutorial written by Simeon Warner (LANL) should be very useful to the
OAI community.

Sincerely,
Jean-Philippe Schmitt
