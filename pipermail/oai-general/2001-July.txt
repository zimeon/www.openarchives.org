Subject: [OAI-general] OAI protocol version 1.1
Message-ID: <3B3F7E38.94E7F47E@cs.cornell.edu>

dear all,

(appologies for cross-posting)

As announced, we are releasing version 1.1 of the Metadata Harvesting
protocol of the OAI.  This version is compliant with the W3C XML Schema
Recommendation of May 2001 (see primer at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-0-20010502/).

* Version 1.1 of the Metadata Harvesting protocol of the OAI is now
available at http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm .

* Instruction for migrating from version 1.0 to version 1.1 are at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/1.1/migration.htm .

* Details about the OAI strategy to phase out version 1.0 are at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/1.1/migration-strategy.htm .

The migration should really be simple. We wish you the best of luck with
it.

cheers

Carl and Herbert

Sorry for the cross posting.  I have have two specific questions, one for
the OAI General and one for the OAI Implementors.

We are creating a Digital Library of Science Education data, however we are
following a different approach than many digital libraries.  We are
targeting amateur astronomers and grade schools and places that will have a
small number (10 to 40) of data items.  They will run an out of the box data
provider package.  We will use OAI to harvest their metadata and provide a
web page to search all these smaller sites.  This was intended to have a
Napster-like architecture.

The problem is that being smaller, more informal sites they probably will
not be 24x7 systems.  In fact, we expect them to fail unexepectedly and go
offline frequently for potentially long periods.

The question for the OAI general is, should less reliable sites like the
ones we are targeting still register with the OAI data provider list?  Or is
there some implied quality of service with respect to uptime?  We need a
mechanism for giving each data provider a unique ID and the OAI Repository
Identifier would be perfect, but requires joining the list.

The question for the OAI Implementors is, we are creating a set of tools
specifically to deal with the unreliability of the sites.  We are using
using Jini to setup a dynamic registration and notification system.  This
way our service provider will get a list of all data providers THAT ARE
CURRENTLY UP.  Also, the servive providers will be notified if a data
provider comes up or goes down.  It will also be notified that a data
provider has changed its metadata and a harvest request should be sent.  Is
this toolkit something that would be of interest to other people/projects?

Hello -

	I would really like to see the registration dates on repositories
currently registered at www.openarchives.org. An accelerating rate of
appearance of new repositories would seem to be a powerful argument for
implementation.

Hi Robert,

It's interesting that we are doing similiar work in kepler project.
(http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april01/maly/04maly.html), the approach of
kepler is like:

1. We maintain a centralized registration server (LDAP).
2. Whenever user installs the unstable data provider( we call it
archivelet), the user will register a unique name in LDAP.
3. Whenever user starts/stops, archivelet will notify the LDAP server.
4. The service provider will periodically query the LDAP server, get all
the active archivelet list, and do the metadata harvesting, besides,
service provider will also cache full-text document.
5. The end-user could search service provider, get the cached full-text
document, or get the original document from archivelet if it's active.
6. The service provider is also a data provider too, and could register
it in OAI website (but archivelet won't). it could expose the
harvested metadata. However, it will assign new OAI identifier to
harvested data, thus it won't arise any naming conflict in OAI naming
space.

We are also interested in the "notify/subscribe" model as you mentioned,
basically OAI protocol is "pull" model based, your solution is like kind
of mixture of "push" and "pull" model, and there are probabaly another
pure "push" model- data provider sends its update to service provider
directly. It willl be very interesting to study the trade-off of these
approaches and their influences to OAI protocol. 



regards,
liu

Subject: Re: Developing an agenda for institutional e-print archives

John MacColl (SELLIC project, University of Edinburgh) has kindly given his
permission for this edited version of his report on the OAi day to be
circulated to the DNER list. The event will also be covered in the September
edition of Ariadne (issue 29).

'Developing an agenda for institutional e-print archives'
Report of Meeting, Institute of Mechanical Engineers, London. 11 July
2001.

The meeting was chaired by Sheila Corrall. The first presentation was given
by Catherine Grout, Assistant Director (Collections) of the DNER, and
essentially outlined the JISC/DNER perspective on the OA initiative, which
is that open archiving provides a technology for cementing the DNER
architecture. The DNER investment over the next few years will be primarily
in middleware, fusion and infrastructure services. Her assumption seemed to
be that content and presentation are already largely catered for (a view
which was challenged later during the moderated discussion at the end of the
day).

JISC services supplying or facilitating access to content are the RDN and
MIMAS, which are seeking to make their metadata OAi-compliant. JISC has also
funded the eprints distribution work at Southampton, and is supporting the
Open Citations project. Tools, guidelines, best practice case studies and
pilot projects are all likely to be the sort of initiatives which JISC will
wish to fund. JISC will be interested also in projects involving communities
other than libraries.

Michael Nelson, (NASA) gave an entertaining historical overview of the OAI
in
'OAi past, present and future'. Distributed searching,  the computing
science 'hammer' to the 'interoperability nail'  is hard to do. There were
many attempts in the mid-90s, which failed. the OAI alternative, metadata
harvesting, proposed instead by Van de Sompel (now the e-Director of the
BL), Nelson, Lagoze and others, was also hard to do. Every archive had its
own different format. The repositories which were included at the beginning
included arXiv (physics), Cogprints (cognitive science), NDLTD (theses) and
RePEc (economics).

The OAi idea separates out data providers from service
providers. Data providers must provide methods for metadata harvesting. The
OAI  is only about metadata  not full-text. It is also neutral with respect
to the source of the metadata. The protocol, launched in January/February of
this year, has been frozen for 12-15 months to allow services to be built on
a stable platform. Nelson also explained the difference between OAi and OAIS
(Open Archival Information System), which is a developing standard for
digital preservation. This has confused a lot of people.

The protocol uses XML, which has lots of advantages (e.g. schemas to
determine compliance). But it is unforgiving and  a strong disciplinarian,
in that it forces clean metadata. The OAi
protocol is always a front-end for another dataset: it has no interface for
record input or deletion. Eprints, for example, is an archiving system with
the OAi protocol built in.  The protocol also supports sets to partition
archives, e.g. by discipline.

Stevan Harnad, Professor of Cognitive Science at the University of
Southampton, then gave a paper on 'The potential of institutional eprint
archives'. OAi has widened from its original focus on eprints, and  Harnad
wanted to narrow the focus back to the original publication type (i.e. peer
reviewed papers). He now calls this the 'Self-Archiving Initiative'. He was
very much in favour of archiving at the institutional level rather than by
discipline - he argued that the motivation to do this is institutional,
since institutions lose when their own researchers work cannot be read by
other researchers, because they are debarred from access due to high
subscription costs. Harnad advocates that all research universities mandate
a CV with all published papers linked to an institutional archive. There is
therefore an explicit link there to RAE methodology, which could make the
RAE redundant (the impact would be measured by continuous assessment.)
Harnad has been trying to persuade a group of Provosts of elite US
universities to do this. In the UK, the people we need to persuade are the
Funding Councils, in order to change the methodology for research
assessment.

After lunch, Paul Ayris, Director of Library Services at UCL, spoke on 'Why
research libraries need open archives'. The cumulative increase in the RPI
since 1986 is c. 50%; that in periodical prices is nearly 300% - while at
the same time library funding in real terms has dropped by about 1% over the
same period. The NESLI deals which have been brokered have proved difficult
for CURL, since they have been based on traditional spend on print journals.
This is effectively a tax on research. CURL wants to lobby for a general
review of STM publishing by the Director of Fair Trading. CURL will produce
advocacy packs for its member institutions for next academic session, to
alert Principals and Vice-Chancellors of the problems.

As Chair of the relevant CURL Task Force, Paul advocated the establishment
of OAi servers in institutions  though consortial or regional models may
also be appropriate. Libraries should lead this. He asked about the costs of
OAi, in terms of staffing, metadata and infrastructure. There is also the
need to clarify the ownership of IPR. In the action plan he suggested,
Glasgow, Nottingham, Edinburgh, Southampton and Strathclyde are all setting
up archives: could JISC fund an evaluation of these? Can JISC funding also
be provided to support the establishment of archives in all institutions?
Charles Oppenheim mentioned in the Q&A that JISC is setting up an IPR
committee under Brian Fender, and including Charles. This will address many
of the issues which Paul had raised.

The next paper was given by Chris Rusbridge and William Nixon of the
University of Glasgow: 'Setting up an institutional eprints archive': what
is
involved? The Glasgow model is inclusive of all types of scholarly
publication, including reports, conference papers, monographs and book
chapters. They had hoped to invoke their archive in the current RAE, but
could not get things established in time. They were explicit about long-term
digital preservation not being part of the aim.

 The Glasgow server has only 15 papers at present. Some of the formats
supported by the eprints software were questioned by Chris (Word and HTML,
for example). Glasgow has added PDF and planning for XML. Being able to link
in to the authentication structures of the institution (as in single
sign-on) would be a good thing.
Links to Reference Manager should be supported, and a better audit trail is
required, as in submission date. He also asked whether any quality checking
should happen.

Chris Rusbridge spoke of his wish to set up an e-theses service at Glasgow,
possibly using NDLTD (Networked Digital Library of Theses and
Dissertations). City University is so far the only UK university in
membership of NDLTD. He said that NDLTD is likely to increase use of these
by 400%, according to Virginia Tech figures.

The final paper was by Rachel Heery: 'European support for Open Archive
activity'.
She introduced a new European project, the Open Archives Forum, an
Accompanying Measure funded by the EC IST programme whose partners include
Humboldt University and IEI-CNR in Pisa. Part of the EC motivation in
funding this is to release the value of the invisible web (materials at a
deep level not often picked up by search engines); and to act as a focus for
dissemination, the collaborative development of software, and to help build
a community of interest. This work is also exploring some of the relevant
business models. It will also evaluate the OAi protocol technologies,
comparing the protocol with  HARVEST and Z39.50, for example, and asking the
question whether DC is sufficiently rich as a metadata format.

The day then concluded with an open discussion session, moderated by Jan
Wilkinson, University Librarian at the University of Leeds. Gordon Dunsire
made a plea for the initiative to cover all scholarly material. That point,
however, had already been granted. There was a suggestion that an XML
cleanser be provided to the community (to clean up bad xml in metadata
records). Ronald Milne presented the case for disciplinary rather than
institutional archives, echoing a point made earlier by Peter Brophy. This
did not receive too much support, though the point was made that most papers
these days are written by authors from
several institutions. The JISC view on the day seemed to be that there
wasn't a contradiction between the two approaches (the metadata could be
produced on an institutional level, and another party might produce a
discipline based view).

Charles Oppenheim made the point that institutional frameworks can help
junior researchers. John MacColl suggested that JISC should fund a pilot
study in a small group of institutions to assess research impact, by
requiring that researcher CVs are deposited online with links to papers in a
local open archive, as Stevan Harnad had suggested in the morning session.
This should also assist in the filling of archives. There was some support
for this notion of a pilot initiative funded by JISC, from Paul Ayris. This
connected with Catherine Grout's reminder that there is a research contract
obliging this in the case of some research councils. Fred Friend also
supported the notion of tackling the Funding Councils on this. Chris
Rusbridge suggested that JISC may make such deposit a condition of any grant
it awards. Thomas Krichel suggested the creation of a disciplinary archive
in library and information science.

Sheila Corrall concluded the meeting with a summing-up: funding from JISC to
allow us to build on existing projects and to experiment; a side by side
institutional/disciplinary approach, since the two are not mutually
incompatible. She also suggested that JISC invite bids for imaginative
suggestions for populating archives, of either type. They should put the
funding up and invite us to bid imaginatively for it.

Garey,

Currently you can determine both the registration date and the date a
repository was last validated by pointing your browser at
http://oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu/Register/BrowseSites.pl -- but only
one site at a time.  Would you like a separate display that lists

Donna -

	I got what I needed using the technique you suggested. Thank you.
I don't know what would be appropriate on the website. I am looking for
support for an internal proposal to implement an OAI repository and I
thought the information would be useful, but for the website you might
argue that registration rates, though interesting, would be more likely to
foster mistaken impressions of success or failure than otherwise.
	I, by the way, am relying not only on how many and when, but who.

Hello all,


I have a question about OAI and its relationship to intellectual
property concerns that I sense might arise - that is, if not 
beaten back with explicit legal disclaimers on the part of 
OAI data providers. This is not a hypothetical interest.


One of the most important things about OAI (to my mind) is
that it explicitly promulgates a principle I call "metadata
transparency" - that organizations who want to make their 
information accessible to as broad a range of users as possible
will make metadata accessible for harvesting by a potentially
equally large range of organizations that want to build 
interfaces to these contents. This is very appealling and
has great applicability for many communities.


The problem I am wrestling with is that what happens
if an organization builds an OAI repository and then 
makes a claim that they hold the intellectual property 
rights to the repository?

Under recent WIPO treaties, this would seem to be a 
legitimate claim since aggregates of fact or data like this
can be considered "original works". If this is so, 
might it not stop other organizations from aggregating 
the same data (perhaps to build a competing data service 
with some prettier interface or better whizbangs)? 


I know this goes counter to most definitions of "open" 
and that really a repository built upon metadata made 
freely accessible SHOULD not do such a thing, but what 
protection is there for a data provider to ensure that
such as situation does not occur? 


Should OAI have some sort of GNU-like license that should
be signed onto that would preclude service providers 
from unfairly exploiting open archives to the detriment
of others? From the OAI perspective, what IP would a 
service provider have claims to?


I look forward to your comments with interest.

Dear Terry,
You raise a very relevant issue, but it might be not a real
problem in the OAI scope...
The idea behind OAI is not to consider "the metadata as THE
resource", but to raise the awareness about the resource that the
metadata describes. In that sense, the value is in the resource,
and not in the metadata that it announces.
IMHO, the organizations willing to put their metadata available
trough an OAI interface must be aware that such metadata will be
"lost" for the public domain. In fact, they should be happy if
someone else will produce added value on the top of it and makes
money with that, since the target is the resource that the
metadata describes...
Regards,
José Borbinha
PS: Maybe this is more like distributing Linux flavors, where the
kernel is always the same, and is free, but you can sell
something more with it, and everyone wins...

  RePEc does not run an OAI repository as yet, but 
  we have the firm intention to set one up AND to
  claim intellectual property rights to the data
  therein.

  Everybody who does not like the usage conditions

  one.

  How come? Our collection has usage conditions, but
  is freely available within those conditions.

  Why not?

  Imagine that you built for 8 years a digital library that is
  arguably the largest distributed academic digital
  library in the world. You and your mates have been 
  working on it for nothing essentially, at the margin
  of regular jobs, in overtime spent at the computer in
  the office rather than with your girlfriend at home.
  Then one day, out of the blue. you find that a commercial company
  have built a web site, have used all your data and claim
  that *they* have collected it, without a single mentioning
  of your efforts. I bet you would be just as outraged as I
  was when exactly that thing happend to RePEc six weeks
  ago! It cost me a hell of a lot of nerves and a bit
  of effort to put things right.

  Sure there should be some thought on that. In fact,
  at the original Santa Fe meeting I presented a 
  framework that would address this issue.

  I would that think that these would be rather small
  and difficult to defend in court. But I am by no
  means a legal expert.

  Some collections made available through OAI may want to 
  mix metadata about resources with data on non-resources.
  That is definitely the case in RePEc.

  We are not happy. We are happy to give the data away
  for free only if it is not sold or included in a product
  for sale.

actually, the rights relationship that SPs may have to DPs is (in a
sense) outside the scope of the protocol.

take a look at:

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm#Identify   
 
specifically, the example at the end of that section.  it is the
responsibility of the DP to advertise its metdata use policy through
the Identify verb.  the eprints.org folks have introduced an
"eprints" namespace to help delineate some of the issues.  note that this
namespace is optional -- this is just a convenient way to provide pointers
to a policy that will be defined "outside" the protocol.

its up to the SP to respect the policies that the DP advertises.

that's not *necessarily* true (though so far, has been true in practice).  
without sliding into the "data" vs "metdata" issue, its entirely possible
and appropriate that a DP might wish to restrict the use of their metadata
(as per Thomas' example).  "Identify" gives DPs/SPs a way to announce and
discover, respectively, this policy.

How all of this actually plays out is hoped to be uncovered in the initial
12-16 months (starting Jan 01) of the official unveiling of the OAI
protocol.

Michael

If your data is available for free, even under terms and
conditions for usage, how is a commercial company going to make
money just exploiting a web site with it? (well, in fact
AltaVista and Google have been doing that, as other metacrawlers
have been doing with them, and so on... so I'm afraid that we are
all contradicting ourselves...).

On the other side if you've built a digital library, that should
mean that you have collected one or more collection of resources,
and that you developed your metadata to describe these resources.
And it is this metadata that you put available through OAI, not
the resources (which can be movies, texts, or more and richer
metadata...)

A good thing that I see in OAI is its simplicity and button-up
approach. It'd be sad to see it intoxicated by its possible
success and jump in complicated processes and visions like we had
for Z39.50, for the top levels of the ISO model, etc...

I was aware that I was entering in dangerous areas with my
previous email (I'm not so naive neither libertarian...), but I
think that this is in fact a very interesting issue to discuss,
since it raises the core problem of the scope of the OAI!!!
Very often nice initiatives have been failing nowadays because of
the lack of clear and understandable objectives! They start as
exploratory activities, in the hope that the light will come in
one of the next coners, but in the end they simply get lost in
messy and confuse purposes...

So, for the future, I'd like to post here my position about this:
please lets try to keep the model simple, and assume that what we
put available through a public OAI interface is just structured
data for public usage, available for usages in meta services just
like AltaVista and Google have been doing with our sites. This
doesn't excludes the usage of private OAI networks for more
restricted materials/purposes/data, but lets not afect the OAI
work with these requirements for now, or at leat until we have it
really imposed (which can be the case, but it we are not there
yet...).
But of course that you all can disagree of me... :-)

Jose Borbinha

Hi,

for an actual example how a wonderful open project, a metadata collection
that has been created by a community effort, a shared public resource, can be
turned into a quagmire of heavy contracts, licensing fees, forced user
registration and anti-competition clauses I want to point out the fate of the
once free cddb, now Gracenote http://www.gracenote.com/terms.html .

There are threats, cease and desist letters to developers of alternatives,
and even lawsuits. Some quotes from news-services



Basically cddb is a online lookup service for music CD titles and songlists
that provides this information to CD playing software. The database was build
by individual users contributing their manually generated datasets to the
database -- i.e. the users typed in the songlists.


"Today when I attempted to rip a new CD I bought, I received this
message. "Your CD player application is either not licensed to use the
Gracenote(tm) CDDB(tm) service or its license has expired. If you are unsure
what this means, please see our web site at http://www.cddb.com/lic/Grip. If
you are a developer and feel you have received this message in error or wish
to get your application licensed, please contact support for assistance.""


"CDDB is refusing connections from Media Jukebox until the Media Jukebox guys
sign an "exclusive agreement" to use CDDB's database."


and http://www.gracenote.com/press/2001051000.html

   BERKELEY, CA (May 10, 2001) -- Gracenote (formerly CDDB) a content delivery
platform provider specializing in music recognition services, today announced
a lawsuit against Roxio, Inc., at present, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Adaptec, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADPT) for breach of contract, patent infringement,
trademark infringement and other violations of Federal law.




While not entirely the same I think there are some obvious analogies here,
and it goes to show that as soon as commercial interest are involved almost
nothing is inconceivable.

Could a OAI service provider, who has built a rich collection of metadata via
OAI, claim exclusive rights to that collection. Could they prevent others to
build a similar collection or provide similar services and functionality?

actually, to continue the analogy...

assuming that a SP attempting to create a Gracenote/CDDB situation, we can
probably count on another SP to come along, harvest the same DPs, and
provide similar services --  http://www.freecddb.org/

within the OAI context, we can handle rogue SPs.  now if a DP collects
eprints from users, and then signs an exclusive license with a SP...  well
that's a whole different ball game.

  Sure. But had the RePEc rip-off really ended up in a court case,
  I would have turned to this community saying that I need $X to 
  fight it. And I am convinced that I would have gotten a response.
  After all, we can not be sure whom it will hit next.

I believe that the IP issue here is real and will cause problems unless
OAI sets a standard disclaimer that says (essentially):

"You are permitted to harvest metadata from this site for the purpose of
access and/or providing a service for others. You may build services
with metadata and claim IP rights for the metadata *plus* service, but
you may not prevent or interfere with others who harvest metadata even
for the same purpose. Only the created service can be protected by IP,
not the metadata or access rights."

While this probably leaves loopholes a lawyer could drive a semi
through, OAI needs something that establishes its *intention* in the
legal arena. I imagine a call to the EFF could provide some help with
the wording.

This style should cover the use of public and free access sites, but
some additional restrictions may be added where a private company who
invested large sums to develop the data requires a license and/or
payment for access to the underlying data. Charging for the metadata
would be counterproductive, although they may require registration
first. 

This issue will not go away if ignored. It will simply create a quagmire
of different legal verbiage and restrictions that could cripple the
potential of a great concept. Please give serious consideration to
establishing your IP standards.

hi all,


I have been following this interesting discussion from a distance (while
packing our stuff for our move to the UK).  A lot of really important
issues have been raised.


In this mail, I would like to add a few elements to the discussion:

* First, the "open" in Open Archives Initiative doesn't refer to the
concept of "open access".  It refers to the fact that repositories have a
machine interface that allows third parties to harvest metadata from the
repositories.  see the OAI FAQ at http://www.openarchives.org/faq.htm
under the heading "What do you mean by 'Open'". Even at the time of the
Santa Fe convention of the OAI (the predecessor of the current metadata
harvesting protocol, which focused on open access preprint literature),
the notion of "open" meant "open in an architectural sense".  see for
instance the paper on the Convention 
(http://www.dlib.org/february00/vandesompel-oai/02vandesompel-oai.html) 
and
the Convention itself
(http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc.htm#openarchives).  As such, it is
fair to say that the OAI protocol doesn't make any statement regarding the
business models under which the full-content described by metadata in
repositories is available.

* As already mentioned in this discussion, the OAI protocol (as opposed to
the Santa Fe Convention, I guess) does not address issues of acceptable
use of harvested metadata: which service provider can do what with
harvested metadata?".  At the Cornell meeting (september 2000) where the
foundations for the OAI protocol were agreed upon, an explicit choice has
been made to hand over acceptable use issues to communities implementing
the OAI protocol.  Having said that, the protocol does explicitely allow
for the inclusion of an "about" container attached to each harvested
metadata record.  Typically such an "about" container could be used to
specify the terms and conditions of the usage of a metadata record.  The
very first example in the protocol document actually shows an example
where this is done.  As such, it allows individual communities to express
terms and conditions regarding metadata use at the level of individual
records.  In addition to that, at the level of a repository, the response
to the Identify verb allows for the inclusion of an open-ended
"description" container.  Again, communities could use this container to
include terms and condition information for all metadata records in the
repository.


So, I think that from a technical perspective, the hooks are there to
allow communities to specify terms and conditions re the usage of metadata
harvested from their repositories.  Then again, the issue raised by this
discussion (in my opinion) is whether it would be a good idea for the OAI
to provide a "default" for terms and conditions at the level of individual
records and at the level of repositories, which could be overwritten by
communities with diverging needs.  The problem I see with that is that it
would probably mean that the OAI would have to take some kind of position
in the IP debate, which I think the OAI has been avoiding since the moment
of the move from the Santa Fe Convention to the OAI Protocol.  The
latter remark is by all means an expression of a personal perspective of
the situation, and it should not be regarded an official statement of the
OAI.

many greetings

I wholeheartedly agree with the view Herbert is taking on the IP issue.
Taking any stand on the IP issue for OAI would be a mess. Once the data
provider has the "technical" capability to communicate the terms and
conditions, then it is up to the data provider and the service provider to
see that the terms and conditions are followed. The OAI should not be in
the picture.

hi all,


I have been following this interesting discussion from a distance (while
packing our stuff for our move to the UK).  A lot of really important
issues have been raised.


In this mail, I would like to add a few elements to the discussion:

* First, the "open" in Open Archives Initiative doesn't refer to the
concept of "open access".  It refers to the fact that repositories have a
machine interface that allows third parties to harvest metadata from the
repositories.  see the OAI FAQ at http://www.openarchives.org/faq.htm
under the heading "What do you mean by 'Open'". Even at the time of the
Santa Fe convention of the OAI (the predecessor of the current metadata
harvesting protocol, which focused on open access preprint literature),
the notion of "open" meant "open in an architectural sense".  see for
instance the paper on the Convention
(http://www.dlib.org/february00/vandesompel-oai/02vandesompel-oai.html)
and
the Convention itself
(http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc.htm#openarchives).  As such, it is
fair to say that the OAI protocol doesn't make any statement regarding the
business models under which the full-content described by metadata in
repositories is available.

* As already mentioned in this discussion, the OAI protocol (as opposed to
the Santa Fe Convention, I guess) does not address issues of acceptable
use of harvested metadata: which service provider can do what with
harvested metadata?".  At the Cornell meeting (september 2000) where the
foundations for the OAI protocol were agreed upon, an explicit choice has
been made to hand over acceptable use issues to communities implementing
the OAI protocol.  Having said that, the protocol does explicitely allow
for the inclusion of an "about" container attached to each harvested
metadata record.  Typically such an "about" container could be used to
specify the terms and conditions of the usage of a metadata record.  The
very first example in the protocol document actually shows an example
where this is done.  As such, it allows individual communities to express
terms and conditions regarding metadata use at the level of individual
records.  In addition to that, at the level of a repository, the response
to the Identify verb allows for the inclusion of an open-ended
"description" container.  Again, communities could use this container to
include terms and condition information for all metadata records in the
repository.


So, I think that from a technical perspective, the hooks are there to
allow communities to specify terms and conditions re the usage of metadata
harvested from their repositories.  Then again, the issue raised by this
discussion (in my opinion) is whether it would be a good idea for the OAI
to provide a "default" for terms and conditions at the level of individual
records and at the level of repositories, which could be overwritten by
communities with diverging needs.  The problem I see with that is that it
would probably mean that the OAI would have to take some kind of position
in the IP debate, which I think the OAI has been avoiding since the moment
of the move from the Santa Fe Convention to the OAI Protocol.  The
latter remark is by all means an expression of a personal perspective of
the situation, and it should not be regarded an official statement of the
OAI.

many greetings

I have to disagree here, though I see his point.

My suggestion was to create a standard disclaimer in order to provide
some basic simple structure to OAI metadata harvesting. It does not
preclude anyone who creates metadata from their own raw data from adding
restrictions or completely rewriting the IP restrictions for that
particular database. 

My reasons for recommending this course of action are:
1. For those metadata providers who do not have laywers on staff, a
working legal disclaimer, or a place to start.
2. A base for *consistent* IP standards for OAI metadata. Get it right
and many sites will follow that base, making access and presentation of
the data *much less complex* from the IP POV.
3. It is much easier to set up a consistent IP approach in the beginning
than try and straighten out the mess that will happen if every provider
goes their own way with IP protection. Can you imagine the complexity of
dealing with hundreds of different IP restrictions? As a programmer, I'd
run screaming in the other direction.
4. Nothing I proposed prevents any site from using a different IP setup,
and I'm sure commercial sites sharing data want better protection for
the underlying raw  data. 
5. IP is guaranteed to be an issue. If we avoid dealing with it now,
even in less than perfect form, we will reap the results of our dodge
later with much pain. I believe that IP chaos could stifle the the
potential benefits of the whole OAI concept. 
6. OAI set standards to make access to and the use of metadata uniform
and easy. While IP is not a programming issue, it *will* control how we
access, present and use both metadata and raw data. Without some
coherent IP structure, the only people who will benefit are the IP
lawyers.

There is no doubt overlap in those items as I am writing this 'off the
top'. Even though IP does not appear to be essential to the standard, it
has such potential to add complexity to both metadata and code that we
should not ignore it.

The spirit of OAi seems to have been well observed so far, but in the 
broadening of OAi to digital libraries there are dangers ahead. This thread 
highlights this but hasn't really got to grips with it.

The relevant legislation seems to be Directive 96/9/EC, Legal Protection of 
Databases, the implications of which are briefly described at
http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/May-00/webber.html
and a copy of the directive at
http://www.law.nyu.edu/engelbergcenter/legislativewatchinternational/DraftDbDirAnlOvrvw.html

Expert interpretations seem to be hard to find. Charles Oppenheim has 
written about this, but I can't find anything online to link to.

I guess this directive would give Thomas' RePEc database some protection. 
The point about preventing others from building similar services using OAi 
metadata would seem to be trickier.

Herbert has covered the data provider issues. From the legal point of view 
I'm not sure there is anything exceptional in the relationship between OAi 
DPs and service providers, compared with a non-OAi equivalent. The 
difficulty DPs have in setting terms of use at this stage is that maybe 
they can't anticipate what SPs will want to use their data or, more 
significantly, what their business models will be.

I think it should be organized by OAI as a subgroup with participation
from implementors, users and OAI community. It needs all POV to be taken
into consideration. 

The subgroup might even consider both free and commercial versions of
the IP statement. It needs the status as coming from OAI as a
recommendation or base IP statement.

hi

i agree to some degree with many people in this discussion ... the
reason why OAI needs to stay out of IP recommendations is that the
Initiative needs to adopt a non-partisan stance so as to promote
widespread adoption of the underlying principles behind the technology.

that said, not supporting a single baseline IP statement is one approach
to achieve this ... another would be to specify a range of possible IP
statements as baselines and i would like for us to investigate the
feasibility of doing this ...

would it be possible for us to specify a small set of standard
statements that are strong enough to serve as a superset statement list
?

for example, if an IP statement said "xyz" then it does not necessarily
preclude the possibility of some or all of the metadata having looser
restrictions ... any data provider that conforms to "xyz" may harvest
the the metadata ... but data providers that are willing to read the
individual statements and weigh the legalities are also welcome at their
own peril to implement "looser-than-xyz" policies ...

i also recommend a simple controlled vocabulary with correspondences to
rights statements that are listed as a supplemental tech document on the
OAI site ... something along the lines of:

"completely free" = "All metadata and associated data may be used
without restriction by any commercial or non-commercial entity for free
access or resale"
"metadata publicly free" = "All metadata may be used without restriction
by any commercial or non-commercial entity, but may not be further
propagated in a non-value-added form for profit"
...

now i know people are going to say this is too complex ... i dont think
it is ... with a little careful wording we can cover most cases with a
few statements ... and a controlled vocabulary will make it so much
easier for service providers to abide by the data providers' policies
...

I think this is a great idea.  It would be great PR for the OAI protocol
if important crawlers would start using it.  But as Michael mentions,
the robots.txt approach may not attract the attention of humans behind
crawlers.  

Can we think about more active ways to communicate the existence of an
OAI interface once a repository has been visited by a crawler?  

cheers

Well, you can pay Inktomi about 25 cents per record to crawl your 
site. In the current economic environment, you won't find much 
interest from the mainstream search engines unless they add to the 
bottom line.

Google is probably the most sophisticated crawler. Google ignores all 
metadata that you provide it, on the reasonable assumption that all 
webmasters stuff keywords to try to rig search results. Google will 
follow a link into a DL; having a fixed, unique URL for each item 
will maximize traffic from google.

Google has roots in the Stanford DL program, an approach them from 
that direction.

You can see the results of our "overtures to the webcrawling 
community". Search for "the origins of chinese communism" at google.

Northern Light is probably a good first target for outreach because 
they build specialty search engines.

Danny Sullivan's  Search Engine Watch. at 
http://www.searchenginewatch.com/ is a good place to learn more. 
Getting Danny interested in OAI would  be a good way to reach out to 
this community.

*Apologies for cross-posting*

At present the LEAF project (Linking And Exploring Authority Files,
http://www.leaf-eu.org) is undertaking a status quo analysis regarding
Authority Information about person names and corporate bodies. With an
online questionnaire we would like to find out what the specific
interests of our anticipated user communities are. What kind of
information do you expect to get from LEAF? What services would you
like to receive?

We are very much interested in finding out in which ways other
institutions (libraries, archives and museums) are dealing with name
authority files. Your specifications are important to us!

If you want to find out more about LEAF, please have a look at the LEAF
website.

You will help us a lot by filling out the online questionnaire which you
can access at:
