*** CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ***

	Museums and the Web 2002
	April 17 -20, 2002
	Boston, Massachusetts, USA
	http://www.archimuse.com/mw2002/

Deadline: November 30, 2001.

Thousands of cultural heritage institutions are now on-line, 
presenting programs, creating communities and delivering information 
using the world wide web. But museums, libraries, archives and others 
involved in creating digital heritage have much to learn about what 
makes web sites successful. To facilitate this exchange of 
information, Archives & Museum Informatics organizes an annual 
international conference devoted exclusively to Museums and the Web. 
Since the first Museums and the Web in 1997, the conference has grown 
steadily to become the largest gathering of cultural heritage 
technologists world-wide.

You are invited to play a role at Museums and the Web 2002. Deliver a 
paper, demonstrate your site, host an on-line activity, orchestrate 
an event or present a workshop the program is made up from 
suggestions by professionals like you!

Full details and on-line proposal submission are available at 
http://www.archimuse.com/mw2002/

The MW2002 program addresses Web-related issues for museums, 
archives, libraries and other cultural institutions. Participants are 
selected by the Program Committee, based on the quality of their 
proposal and their previous work.  The Deadline for Proposals is 
November 30, 2001. Watch for the Preliminary Program on-line in 
January, 2002.

Accepted speakers must write full papers for the MW2002 Proceedings, 
available to all registrants at the conference, and published 
pre-conference on the Web. Others may write papers if they wish. All 
papers are due February 15, 2002.

Conference Papers are on-line for all previous Museums and the Web 
conferences. See http://www.archimuse.com/mw.html for links. Printed 
proceedings (with an accompanying CD-ROM) are also available.

Questions?
Email mw2002@archimuse.com with any questions about Museums and the 
Web. If you would like to receive the Preliminary Program, please

Dear OAI colleagues,

The Digital Document Discourse Environment (D3E) is released today for
free download, most components open source with others to follow.

Of specific interest to the OAI community may be "Ubiquitous-D3E", 
which enables you to publish any website in the world for discussion. 
This of course could be a threaded peer review discussion on an OAI 
URL (which is in fact the example illustrated at 
http://d3e.open.ac.uk/ubiquitous-d3e.html). Try it now on your 
archive at http://otis.open.ac.uk/ubiq/

The main announcement is below.

Simon

(In the context of an ejournal (as opposed to an eprint archive), 
we've been using D3E for interactive web peer review debate since 
1996: http://www-jime.open.ac.uk)

2nd November, 2001

The Digital Document Discourse Environment (D3E) is released today for
free download, most components open source with others to follow.


WHAT IS D3E?

Use D3E to publish web discussion documents. The content (any web 
media) is linked visually and explicitly to a threaded discussion 
space. Bibliographic citations, footnotes and section headings are 
also converted to hyperlinks to assist navigation, especially in 
large documents. Document and discussions are bound together as a 
single artifact.

Since discussion documents underpin almost all knowledge-intensive 
work, D3E has found numerous applications in its 5 year evolution. 
Some examples are on the site, including journal peer review, 
distance learning, participatory software design, and strategic 
planning.

                    ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

D3E is available in two forms:

   1. Full-D3E:
      Publisher's Toolkit: desktop Java application
      + a Web discussion system: D3E-Phorum or D3E-HyperNews
      (customizations of the open source Phorum and HyperNews systems)

   2. Ubiquitous-D3E:
      A server-side application, with any web browser as client;
      enables you to publish any website in the world for discussion

                    ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

My comrade-at-arms Ebs Hilf has misinterpreted the sense of my "only."

He is of course quite right that central, discipline-based
self-archiving (in OAI-compliant Eprints Archives) is likewise an
effective and welcome form of self-archiving. However, as I wrote in
the very next posting:

It was with this fact in mind that I had written written the earlier "only"
passage:

http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/1653.html

The force of the "only" was coupled with the sense of the "right now"!

A researcher in any particular discipline today (other than Physics,
Mathematics, or Cognitive Sciences) cannot take the initiative and
self-archive his refereed research in a central archive for his discipline,
because such central archives do not yet exist for most disciplines! Nor,
where they do exist, are they filling anywhere near fast enough (see the
2 Digitometrics links above).

Researchers' individual (and thereby collective) leverage (and rewards
for publication and impact) operates largely at the level of their own
institutions. Researchers need not install any software themselves, nor
learn anything about OAi. They need only encourage their own
universities to do so, out of shared self-interest in research
visibility, uptake and impact:

    7. What you can do now to free the refereed literature online
    http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/resolution.htm#7

    "Online or Invisible?" (Steve Lawrence)
    http://www.neci.nec.com/~lawrence/papers/online-nature01/

By way of OAI-interoperable central Eprint Archives, physicists and mathematicians 
today have http://arxiv.org and Ebs's PhysDoc (or Math-Net)
http://physnet.uni-oldenburg.de/PhysNet/physdoc.html and Cognitive
Scientists have http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/

But for all the other disciplines, the fastest and surest path today is
to have their own institutions install their own OAI-compliant
Institutional Eprint Archives (using the free http://www.eprints.org
software) as a growing number of universities and research institutions
are now doing:

Central and Distributed Self-Archiving are complementary paths, converging
on the same goal: the freeing of online access to the refereed research
literature. All such Archives are integrable into the interopeable
pantheon of OAI-compliant Archives Worldwide, which becomes a global
"virtual collection" free for everyone, everywhere, forever: 
http://oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu/Register/BrowseSites.pl

I repeat: The ONLY way to fast-forward ALL of the current research being
published in the 20,000 refereed journals worldwide RIGHT NOW is through
immediate author/institution self-archiving.

Hello all,

I have sent notes to some of you about various things in the past and
just wanted to clarify again a few points.

Looking through the OAI spec, I want to make sure that I am reading
this correctly. Dublin Core allows all elements to be repeatable.
In the OAI spec DC schema, it has:

<choice minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">

Does this mean the DC elements are repeatable in OAI?
And is it possible to "bag" these or use XML IDs for ordering the elements?

Also, Carl Lagoze indicated that language support was lacking in OAI
and that this was going to be looked into in the future.

Am I correct that OAI does not do anything with XML attributes like "lang"
or an element ID?

What are the implications for compliance if I were to use them?

Assistance appreciated.

hi

yes, DC elements are repeatable when used according to the OAI schema.

as far as language tags go, "xml:lang" parameters will not survive 
strict validation tests since the OAI schema does not explicitly allow 
it. i just tried this using both XSV and Xerces options on the 
repository explorer and both returned errors for an "xml:lang" 
attribute. i suspect that since the official data provider registry uses 
XSV, it will not pass those tests either ...

but this is simply a question of changing the schema to make it more 
inclusive and as far as i know, that is currently being considered as a 
possibility. for NDLTD, we have already done this in the ETDMS schema 
(http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/etdms.xsd) and i know 
the IMS metadata group has done the same in their latest specs ... i 
think OAI will go this route sooner or later ...

as a short-term solution, how about creating a new schema strictly for 
this purpose ? and then use it instead of the OAI one ? if you are 
interested, i can help ...

about ordering, i thought XML was inherently ordered ? am i wrong about 
this ?

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.10.10111210015200.7225-100000@defiant.cs.odu.edu>

Hi all,

(appologies for cross-posting)

A new OAI service provider for Web Crawlers- DP9 is available, the idea
comes from one discussion in this list -- how to index OAI archives in
Google? 
 
DP9 is a gateway service that enables indexing of an OAI data provider by
an Internet search engine. The DP9 allows a web crawler to retrieve
records in an OAI collection by executing OAI requests and translating XML
responses into HTML format on behalf of a web crawler. 
 
Below are the services that DP9 provides:
 
An entry page,if Web Crawler find entry page and dig into these links, it
will index all records in an OAI data provider. 
 http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/index.jsp
 
Persistent and bookmarkable URL for OAI record. An example,     

 http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/getrecord.jsp?identifier=oai:arXiv:astro-ph/9501031&prefix=oai_dc
 
Parallel metadata Set, but only limited format is supported now,  new
metadata support could be easily added-- just send us your XSL file

http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/getrecord.jsp?identifier=oai:VTETD:etd-3345131939761081&prefix=oai_rfc1807
 
The DP9 code is available from 
   http://arc.cs.odu.edu:8080/dp9/install.jsp
It's based on JSP and XSLT, if you install it in your own server, it will
make your OAI compliant archive webcrawler-enabled, and with your own URL.
 
DP9 is a gateway service, it doesn't cache the OAI record and just
forwards any request to corresponding OAI data provider, so its quality of
service is highly depended on the server availabity of OAI data providers.
 
DP9 now uses the data providers list from OAI website
 http://www.openarchives.org/Register/ListFriends.pl

We'd welcome any feedback or advice.

Again, for info...

The IMS Digital Repositories Working Group has released a Digital
Repositories White Paper

  http://www.imsproject.org/imsdr_whitepaper_v1p6.html

The paper discusses the scope of the working group, which includes:

- integration of e-learning with existing and emerging online digital
  asset services; and,
- repository technology to support the configuration, presentation, and
  delivery of learning objects.

The paper mentions 'gathering' of metadata from digital repositories.
While there is no specific mention of using the OAI-MHP as the basis for
metadata gathering, I (as one of the contributors to the paper) would
anticipate that it is likely to be seen as the technology of choice for
this. (OAI is mentioned in passing in the first para of section 3.).

Dear All,

I have just joined this list, as part of my own 
strategy in getting started with OAI. My main interest 
in knowing about OAI is to be able to provide Brazilian 
researchers from the social sciences and humanities 
with OAI facilities. It is actually part of a research 
project in which I have worked over the last few days. 
I will therefore, be highly interested in exchange 
ideas and receiving suggestions on this.
