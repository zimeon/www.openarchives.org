Conference in Berlin

On behalf of the G=F6ttingen State and University Library (SUB), the Dublin=
=20
Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), and the Information Technology Section of=
=20
the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions=20
(IFLA) we would like to invite you to the Satellite meeting:

"Information Technology and DCMI"
http://post-ifla.sub.uni-goettingen.de/

being held at the G=F6ttingen State and University Library (SUB), Germany=20
from 11th August to the 12th of August 2003.
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open forum engaged in the=20
development of interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad=
=20
range of purposes and business models. DCMI's activities include=20
consensus-driven working groups, global workshops, conferences, standards=20
liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of=20
metadata standards and practices.
The IFLA Information Technology Section (ITS) serves to promote and advance=
=20
the application of information technologies (IT) to library and information=
=20
services in all societies, through activities related to standards,=20
education and training, research, and the marketplace. ITS scope includes=20
IT for the creation, organization, storage and maintenance, retrieval, and=
=20
transfer of information and documents of all types of libraries and=20
information centers. It also includes IT for the operation of libraries and=
=20
information centers, as well as managerial and policy issues regarding IT.=
=20
Of primary importance are network and wireless technologies as they apply=20
to IT as well as applications of IT for supporting access to and delivery=20
of information.
The G=F6ttingen State and University Library, Germany (SUB) is an=
 outstanding=20
German academic library with numerous rare and comprehensive collections.=20
In several research projects the SUB has proved to be a leading institution=
=20
in the field of Digital Library and online information services. For=20
digitization activities the SUB runs a sophisticated digitization and=20
service center (GDZ). The SUB's qualification to combine the preservation=20
of cultural heritage with future-oriented technology has been recognised by=
=20
the award "Library of the Year 2002".

Topics/Scope
The scope of this Satellite meeting will not only be to demonstrate new=20
developments in the field of (Dublin Core) metadata and their=20
implementations, but also to encourage even more organisations around the=20
world to use the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting=
=20
to exchange and share metadata collections (repositories).
Further objectives include discussions about important related issues like=
=20
long-term preservation and metadata registry.
One further important focus will be based on questions of follow-ups for=20
the next Dublin Core conference this year in Seattle (Washington, USA) from=
=20
the 28th of September to the 2nd of October 2003 and the DCMI's National=20
Affiliate concept.
For the Satellite meeting we expect an international range of interesting=20
talks exploring common approaches and challenges to the topic of DCMI=20
(state of the art report), metadata issues, long-term preservation, OAI and=
=20
registry. It will focus on different hot topics, like national OAI=20
activities, Dublin Core experiences and the daily use as well as special=20
preservation approaches.

Who should attend
all who are working with or interested in aspects of the Dublin Core=20
Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and/or the use of Dublin Core metadata
people from libraries, museums who are considering making their=20

**Apologies for cross-posting**

'In Practice, Good Practice: the Future of Open Archives' - The 4th Open Archives Forum Workshop, 4-5 September 2003, Bath UK.

The 4th Open Archives Forum will take place at UKOLN, University of Bath,
UK, on the 4th and 5th of September. The title of the workshop is: 'In
Practice, Good Practice'. 

The workshop is now taking registrations for this event. Registration can be completed via a page at the 
Open Archives Forum project site at: http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/bath_invitation.php. 
The programme of the workshop is available at: 
http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/bath_programme.php

***

Details:

The event will focus on good practice in the implementation of open
archives. A particular theme of the workshop will be the use of the Open
Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting [OAI-PMH] in the area
of Cultural Heritage. The workshop will also be looking at the use of the
OAI protocol as a way of publishing information about university theses,
and how that might contribute to developing useful content for
institutional (as opposed to subject-based) eprint archives.

The workshop will build on issues discussed during the whole project, and
draw inferences about best practice. These include technical issues,
organisational issues and Intellectual Property Rights. A report on
organisational issues written by a OAForum working group will be
discussed at the workshop. Breakout sessions will offer the opportunity to
discuss issues of practice with others working at the sharp end of
implementation.

There also will be an introduction to one of the project's key
deliverables: an online tutorial which will give guidance to those wishing
to implement a project using the OAI-PMH. This tutorial will be based on
the experience of the successful pre-workshop tutorials held in Lisbon
(2002) and Berlin (2003).

There will be a  poster session to allow  project dissemination, and  time and space for
 networking. Those wishing to submit a poster should contact Sara Hassen (s.hassen@ukoln.ac.uk)

There will be representatives of the Open Archives Initiative 
present at the workshop, as we have had at earlier workshops, 
and there will be other important figures in the open archives world present. 
There will be contribution from LIBER and SPARC on the current status of Open Access. 
A panel session closing the second day of the workshop will offer the opportunity 
to exchange views about the future direction of open archives, and about our experience of the open 
archives approach so far.

The Open Archives Forum is a EU funded project, whose purpose is to explore
the possibilities of the open archives idea in the European context, and to
facilitate access to relevant information. More information can be found on the Open Archives Forum website at: http://www.oaforum.org/
