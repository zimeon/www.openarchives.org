INTERNATIONAL INTERNET PRESERVATION CONSORTIUM

In acknowledgement of the importance of international collaboration for
preserving internet content for future generations, the International
Internet Preservation Consortium was formed in 2003.

Led by the Bibliotheque nationale de France, the Consortium also
comprises National libraries of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom ,The Library of Congress
(USA) and the Internet Archive.

The Consortium has identified a number of key objectives which inform
and shape its work. These include:

	- collaborative working, within each country's legislative =
framework,
to identify, develop and facilitate implementation of solutions for
selecting, collecting, preserving and providing access to internet
content;

	- facilitating international coverage of internet content =
archive
collections within national legal frameworks and in accordance with
individual national collection development policies;

	- international advocacy for initiatives that encourage the =
collection,
preservation and access to internet content.

To achieve these objectives, the Consortium will:

	- provide a forum for sharing knowledge about internet content
archiving both within the Consortium and beyond;

	- develop and recommend standards;

	- develop interoperable tools and techniques to acquire, archive =
and
provide access to web sites;

	- raise awareness of internet preservation issues and =
initiatives
through conferences, workshops, training events, publications, etc.

The detailed work of the Consortium will be carried out through working
groups to define Policy, Requirements, Methods, Standards and Tools for
Internet archiving. By this means projects will be developed and
defined and will ultimately lead to the creation and provision of the
necessary tools to fulfil the vision of universal coverage of internet
archive collections.
