Subject: [OAI-general] Open-Access Eprint Archive Registry
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10402040229421.16324-100000@pandora>

Tim Brody of Southampton University, the creator of 
    citebase 
    http://citebase.eprints.org/cgi-bin/search
    celestial 
    http://celestial.eprints.org/ 
    and the usage-impact/citation-impact correlator 
    http://citebase.eprints.org/analysis/correlation.php
has now created a Registry for Open Access Eprint Archives -- both Eprints.org
archives and other archives. The only requirement is that they be open-access
and OAI-compliant:
    http://archives.eprints.org

The Registry currently lists 132 "live" Eprint Archives and 15 "dead" ones
(bad links). He also has charts plotting Eprint Archive growth, both in number of
archives and in number of papers in the archives.

The Registry also makes it possible for you to add any Eprint Archive you know of
that is not yet in the Registry. Please do add any Eprint Archive you know of!
http://archives.eprints.org/eprints.php?action=add

Please feel free to re-post this on any pertinent lists.
