Subject: OR2008: Call for Posters

OPEN REPOSITORIES 2008: CALL FOR POSTERS
<A HREF="http://www.openrepositories.org/2008">http://www.openrepositories.org/2008</A>

We invite developers, researchers and practitioners to submit 2-page poster 
proposals describing novel experiences or developments in the construction and 
use of repositories.

Repositories are being deployed in a variety of settings (research, 
scholarship, learning, science, cultural heritage) and across a range of scales 
(subject, national, regional, institutional, project, lab, personal). The aim 
of this conference is to address the technical, managerial, practical and 
theoretical issues that arise from diverse applications of repositories in the 
increasingly pervasive information environment.

A programme of papers, panel discussions, poster presentations, user groups, 
tutorials and developer coding sessions will bring together all the key 
stakeholders in the field. Open source software community meetings for the 
major platforms (EPrints, DSpace and Fedora) will also provide opportunities to 
advance and co-ordinate the development of repository installations across the 
world.

IMPORTANT DATES AND CONTACT INFO
Submission Deadline: Monday 4th February 2008
Conference: April 1-4, 2008. University of Southampton, UK.

Enquiries to: Program Committee Chair (e.lyon -- ukoln.ac.uk) or General Chair 
(lac -- ecs.soton.ac.uk)
