Message-ID: <20010801164418.A31652@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

As announced last month at the London OAI meeting:

August 1st 2001:
EPrints 2 Alpha-1 has been released and is available from:
http://www.eprints.org/files/eprints/

Features Include
 - International language support (UTF-8 and multiple "phrase" files)
 - Much improved database back end - real text indexing and normalised data.
 - Improved installation (no longer uses ./configure & make)
 - Full support for multiple archives on one server
 - Object Oriented Design and database abstraction

Caveats
 - This is not a stable (or even fully working) release.
 - It is not an upgrade for EPrints 1 series.
 - Many bits remain to be done.

If all goes to plan, from tonight, nightly builds from CVS will be available too.

See http://www.eprints.org/ for more information on the eprints project.

Message-ID: <404A3A4758DDCC4C8A5C9A537384F9D60E5292@opus.cs.cornell.edu>

Dear all:

We are pleased to announce the availability of the new open archives
initiative web site at http://www.openarchives.org.  This new site is
served from Cornell University - the former site was served from Los
Alamos National Labs Library.  We are grateful for the excellent support
by LANL library since the inception of the OAI.  Because of the
mechanics of DNS, it may take a couple of days for the name resolution
to propagate across the network.  Please be patient if you still are
resolved to the old site.

The new site incorporates a number of improvements:

- easier and more uniform navigaton across OAI information
- shortcuts from the home page to core documents and information
- opportunities for formation and links to OAI communities.  We invite
you to use the "submit a post to our web site" feature available from
the home page so that we can link to OAI related information from your
community.

As always feedback is welcome to openarchives@openarchives.org.

Thanks,

Herbert Van de Sompel

An idea that just popped in my mind: how about a 'Set' (or subject) creation
plugin for EPrints. It would take a search result list and assign a common
subject to them all. The OAI would export that as a Set, which can then be
selectively harvested. [Is my understanding correct that EPrints subjects
are in fact OAI sets? And that OAI has a mechanism to selectively harvest
sets?]

Shouldn't be to tough to add a "make subject" link in a staff eprint search
result screen, prompt for a subject name and add that name to the subject
field for all records returned in the set.

A more sophisticated approach would be to enable queries like: 'Create a set
for each author'. The script would then need to generate a search query for
each author name and assign them to a subject/set. Another valuable query
would be to 'Create a set for these year ranges'. Many other possibilities.

All of this of course relies on good and consistent metadata to create
complete and relevant sets.

Jim,           You are right, all statements to date from the Chemistry 
Preprint Server on OAi seem to be vague, professing support but not 
implementation yet. The key point perhaps, especially as this is a preprint 
rather than an eprint archive, is whether the journals, say those that 
accept papers from the CPS, are willing to make metadata available through 
OAi. There is no reason why they shouldn't, since for the last year OAi has 
explicitly had a digital library scope rather than an eprint scope. Except 
the publishers will have noted there appears to be value in the metadata, 
currently being realised by CrossRef. The only publisher, as far as I am 
aware, that is planning to make journals data available through OAi is 
BioMed Central. Are there others?

Dear Colin, 

I am forwarding your query to the OAI and Eprints lists as yours is a
technical question and has already had some thought and discussion
devoted to it.

I would note, in passing, that by far the most pressing objective at
this time is not that of devising the optimal indexing system for
the Eprint Archives (though that can be accomplished) but that of
getting CONTENT into those archives, as soon as possible (so that,
if you like, there will be the data to optimize the indexing FOR!).

So my own feeling is that it is putting the cart before the horse to
worry too much about indexing still-near-empty archives! The growing
content itself, and its growing use, will drive the further
optimizations in indexing and retrieval, not the other way round.

But inasmuch as worries about indexing may be delaying some people's
self-archiving, by all means let us make a robust and general indexing
system available, so that particular retardant, at least, is behind us
and we can get on with it...

If ANU soes indeed have tens of thousands of articles in its Eprint
Archives soon, it will already have taken a huge step for the entire
research community, showing the way for all!

Best wishes,

Stevan

Questions and comments regarding the CPS have been cross-posted by list

Firstly, I would like to thank everybody for their comments regarding the
evolution of the Chemistry Preprint Server (CPS). I would like to briefly
address some of the points that have been raised.

Jim Till has provided some very revealing analysis of the submissions to the
CPS
(http://listserver.sigmaxi.org/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind01&L=september98-forum&F
=l&P=29519). It will certainly be interesting to repeat this analysis when
more preprints have been submitted.

To this, I would like to add that each article that is submitted to the CPS
has its own discussion group where users can comment on the content of the
article. It is encouraging that there has been sustained use of these
discussion groups. For example, 45 of the 282 preprints submitted now have
more than 3 threads in their discussions. I think it will also be
interesting to monitor how this feature is used.

Regarding the issue of compliance with the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) I
would like to confirm that we have constantly referred to the initiative
when developing the CPS. This is certainly a high priority because
ChemWeb.com has developed the CPS as a service for the worldwide chemistry
community.

It is our intention that the CPS will be compliant within the next two
months.

I hope that this has helped to address some of the issues raised. We would
of course welcome any feedback or comments on the service.

Please do not hesitate to contact me personally if you have any queries or
comments.

Best regards,

James Weeks

Arun calling from Madras, India. Congratulations to
ANU for establishing their own institutional Open
Archives. I was there at ANU late last month as a
guest of Dr Linda Butler, aquite but efficient
researcher in the area of science policy and
scientometrics, and I had the pleasure of having lunch
and exchanging notes on the OAI with a group of
librarians in the Canberra area. It is very important
that large research universities set up their own Open
Archives and make their research publications
avaialble free on the web to researchers everywhere.
In the last few weeks, leading commercial publishers
have promised to release more than a thousand
biomedical journals to be accessed free (after six
months of publication), a concession they had to make
if they have to survive the Public Library of Science
and Open archives movements.

Sorry to combine two list posts in this response, but in each case I need 
help to decide if I'm numerically challenged or not. Brevity is fine, but 
clarity is better.

Kurt,         1M what - indexed papers? Archives! I've looked at your 
snapshot, but I can't tell what is significant. Can you enlighten?

Arun,          1k journals? Where is this information from?

Subject: [EP-underground] Demo EPrints Archive Online!

We have set up a server running the latest (i.e. most unstable) version of
EPrints 2 at http://demoprints.eprints.org. Feel free to prod, poke,
use Kanji, and see what happens (or doesn't). Please don't report any bugs
yet, but interface & design comments are welcome.

Warning: The server will be reinstalled quite regularly with the latest
CVS version of Ep2, so user records/submissions will magically vanish
without warning, and things may break where they didn't break before :-)

So this is only for those who want a direct hand in shaping the features
of the future stable upgrades of the Eprints software.

Enjoy!

The Eprints Team
