Subject: [OAI-general] CYCLADES questionnaire: reminder
Message-ID: <p05010402b7258920addf@[146.48.85.73]>

Dear Sirs,
this is a reminder to all of you which might be interested in taking 
some minutes in filling out our questionnaire concerning the CYCLADES 
project.
(http://www.iei.pi.cnr.it/cyclades/)
The deadline is May, 18th.

Cyclades' goal is to provide a set of services on top of OAI 
compliant archives, namely:

- Search and Browse Service: develops plans for the execution of user
queries and browsing

- Collection Service: provides mechanisms for dynamically building meaningful
collections over several OAI compliant archives

- Personalization Service: supports personalization of information
access on the basis of individual user profiles and of profiles of scholarly
communities to which users belong.

Recommendation Service: provides recommendations to satisfy information needs
of a user based on ratings provided by other users or groups.

Collaborative Work Service: supports collaboration between members of virtual
communities. Community working areas are created to use the OAi content in
collaborative work.

We appreciate any comment and hope that CYCLADES will contribute to 
the success of the OAI.

Sincerely,

	The Cyclades consortium

               CALL FOR PAPERS AND PARTICIPATION


                            DC-2001

              International Conference on Dublin Core 
                  and Metadata Applications 2001

                   http://www.nii.ac.jp/dc2001/

Date:       22 - 26 October 2001
Venue:      National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan
Sponsors:   National Institute of Informatics (NII, http://www.nii.ac.jp/)
            Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI, http://dublincore.org/)
            Japan Science and Technology Corporation 
            (JST, http://www.jst.go.jp/EN/)

Providing machine-understandable data on the Web has become a priority
not just for publishers and scientific communities, but for a wide
range of commercial ventures and services.  Resource discovery across a
diversity of services on the emerging Semantic Web is facilitated by
the use of shared metadata vocabularies such as the Dublin Core
Metadata Element Set.

The Dublin Core workshop series has provided a forum for international,
cross-disciplinary metadata development since 1995.  DC-2001, ninth in
this series, will include an international conference for the broader
metadata community with three principal missions:

-- to provide a forum to discuss further development of the Dublin Core
   and related metadata standards

-- to provide a forum to present and exchange new ideas about metadata
   and applications, not limited to Dublin Core, and

-- to provide tutorials on the creation, management, and use of
   metadata applications.

DC-2001 is the first event in the DC Workshop series to be hosted in
Asia and is also the first event to include conference and tutorial
tracks in addition to the workshop.

The Conference track of DC-2001 (Wednesday-Friday, 24-26 October)
invites submissions of papers in the following areas:

-- Conceptual models for metadata
-- Implementation of systems and tools for metadata applications
-- Surveys and case studies of metadata applications
-- Novel activities based on metadata
-- Interoperability among metadata systems
-- Relationships among various metadata standards

The Workshop track (Monday-Wednesday, 22-24 October), will feature
technical meetings of ongoing working groups of the Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative.  The agenda for the workshop track is under
development in DCMI Working Groups.  All active members of working
groups, and others who would like to become active, are invited to
participate.

Deadlines

  Paper Submission:             20 June 2001
  Acceptance Notification:      31 July 2001
  Camera-Ready Copy due:        7 September 2001

Paper Categories

  Regular Paper: 8-10 pages
  Short paper: 2-4 pages

  The "short paper" category will include not only research papers but
  also demonstrations of applications, implementation and activity
  reports.

Author Guidelines

  Papers should be submitted via a Web form at
  http://www.nii.ac.jp/dc2001/ in PDF, the preferred format, or in
  Postscript. If necessary -- eg, because of special fonts -- printouts
  on paper are acceptable.  Authors should follow style guidelines
  posted at http://www.nii.ac.jp/dc2001/.  For information on the PDF
  format, please refer to http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/.

  All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the program committee and
  published both in print and electronically in the conference
  proceedings.  All accepted papers must be presented at the conference
  by at least one of their authors.

Special issue of JoDI

  Selected papers will be submitted for inclusion (with potential
  further review) in a special issue of the Journal of Digital
  Information (JoDI, http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/), a peer-reviewed
  electronic journal published on the Web. The intention is to publish
  this issue simultaneously with the conference proceedings.

*************************************************************************
Open Archives meeting: Developing an agenda for institutional e-print
archives
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/open-archives/intro.html
Wednesday 11th July, 2000
The Institute of Mechanical Engineers, No. 1 Birdcage Walk, London
Coordinated by UKOLN
***************************************************************************
On behalf of the DNER and CURL, UKOLN is coordinating a
one day Open Archives event on Wednesday 11th July  which will take place in
London at The Institute of Mechanical Engineers, No. 1 Birdcage Walk,
Westminster.
(Registration instructions can be found at the end of this message)

This event will provide background to open archive activity currently
taking place in the UK and beyond, and will consider implications for the
HE and FE sectors in the UK. The focus of the event is for institutions to
help set an agenda and contribute to shaping future open archive activity
in the UK.  The DNER wishes to raise awareness of open archive activity
currently taking place and consult with the community regarding any future
support that is required.  The event will aim to identify key issues from
an institutional viewpoint, looking at the dual roles of metadata provider
and service provider.

Initial work undertaken by the e-print community to ensure
interoperability between e-print archives has been taken forward by the
Open Archive Initiative (OAI) in a wider context. The OAI is concerned
with opening access to a range of digital material by providing an
interoperable framework for metadata and service provision. The Open
Archives Initiative is intent on exploring and developing an interoperable
technological framework to support this activity thereby opening up access
to a range of digital materials. At present the first step has been taken
with the provision of the Open Archive Metadata Protocol which enables
organisations to 'declare' metadata and service providers to 'harvest'
that metadata.

There is significant potential for re-using the pattern of service
provision initially developed by the e-print community, in a wider context
to include provision of data by a range of organisations, whether at the
level of individual authors, departments, or institutions. In addition
libraries and  publishers may want to consider their role in the OAI
interoperability framework. The DNER and CURL have an interest in
exploring the benefits of the open archives approach as a low cost means
to disseminate content  now 'hidden' in learning and research institutions

Target audience:
This meeting is for individuals who have a particular interest in the future
of open archives. The event will aim for about 80-100 attendees.
If you would like to attend please return the booking form at
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/open-archives/booking-form.html
by FRI 29TH JUNE.

The workshop is being funded by the DNER. Meals and refreshments during the
workshop are covered, attendees are responsible for their own travel costs.
The workshop programme is currently in draft format and can be seen at

Dr.Harnad,

As both Dr.Maly and Dr.Zubair are out of town, hereby I want to explain
some technical details, and later the professors may give more feedback
when they are back.

The similarities between eprint-archive and kepler:
Both are OAI compliant and support self-archiving.

The differences:
Kepler is targeted to typical users, it's easy to use and self installing,
like most windows applications. From the user's point of view, they don't
necessarily know anything about webserver/oai/database, the only thing
left is to register it and share documents. To reach this purpose, we
implement a very simple http server, which is self-configured, supports
and only supports OAI request/document download, this server and a simple
editor are encapsulated into a installshield package.

For reliability and persistence, We are pursuing the solution of
caching document in service provider side, like the strategy of Internet
Archive. It could partially solve the problem.

Dear Tim,

There is no problem of implementing kepler functionalities using existing
web server, like most OAI compliant data providers. But the key difference
here is the targetted users, kepler is supposed to be used by common users
(not necessarily computer science major) in desktop, for many of these
users, it may not be easy/convenient to install a complex web server and
make it OAI-compliant.

The model of kepler is very similiar to napster/gnutella, people simply
download it and share their files. I think both centralized model
(traditional webserver) and distributed model (peer-2-Peer) can implement
the file sharing functionalities, but both have its advantages and can not
substitute each other.

regards,
liu

As far as I can tell (and I hope my more technical colleagues will be
able to confirm or correct this), Kepler is a kind of smaller-scale
eprints.org archive-maker. It too creates an (OAI-compliant?)
archive, but at the individual rather than the institutional level.

As such, if it works and is robust, it is more than welcome! It can
contribute to the freeing of the refereed literature.

Only three things worry me about Kepler. 

(1) It looks like it is appealing to authors to SELF-PUBLISH (rather
than merely to self-archive their research, pre- and post-publication).
This "vanity press" motivation is, in my opinion, at odds with the
self-archiving intiative, whose primary goal is to free the refereed
journal literature on-line.

(2) One advantage of institutional rather than individual archives is
that it puts the long-term preservation function into stronger and more
durable hands. Can individuals promise this same reliability?

(3) The association with Napster is not a confidence-enhancing
one...
september98-forum@amsci-forum.amsci.org

But the proof of the pudding is in the eating. If the Kepler software
works, and is robust, reliable and lasting, then I certainly hope
authors will use it, and register and maintain their archives at OAI.

"Peer Review" and "Preservation" are high on the list of prima facie
worries that are retarding self-archiving. It is very important that
our efforts refute rather reinforce such worries...

Apologies if you have already considered this:

Would it be possible to use existing web servers to provide the same
functionality as kepler?

Although not intended, I believe OAI responses could be served from static
pages. Given suitable scripts/GUI authors would upload their documents and
related metadata, without having to have their archivelet online to support
harvesting?

(I can foresee a relatively simple PHP/ASP script that would allow an author
to manage his/her archivelet from a web page)

All the best,
Tim Brody
