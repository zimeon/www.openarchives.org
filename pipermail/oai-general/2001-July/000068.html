<PRE>The spirit of OAi seems to have been well observed so far, but in the 
broadening of OAi to digital libraries there are dangers ahead. This thread 
highlights this but hasn't really got to grips with it.

The relevant legislation seems to be Directive 96/9/EC, Legal Protection of 
Databases, the implications of which are briefly described at
<A HREF="http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/May-00/webber.html">http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/May-00/webber.html</A>
and a copy of the directive at
<A HREF="http://www.law.nyu.edu/engelbergcenter/legislativewatchinternational/DraftDbDirAnlOvrvw.html">http://www.law.nyu.edu/engelbergcenter/legislativewatchinternational/DraftDbDirAnlOvrvw.html</A>

Expert interpretations seem to be hard to find. Charles Oppenheim has 
written about this, but I can't find anything online to link to.

I guess this directive would give Thomas' RePEc database some protection. 
The point about preventing others from building similar services using OAi 
metadata would seem to be trickier.

Herbert has covered the data provider issues. From the legal point of view 
I'm not sure there is anything exceptional in the relationship between OAi 
DPs and service providers, compared with a non-OAi equivalent. The 
difficulty DPs have in setting terms of use at this stage is that maybe 
they can't anticipate what SPs will want to use their data or, more 
significantly, what their business models will be.

</I>&gt;<i>would be counterproductive, although they may require registration
</I>&gt;<i>first.

</I>&gt;<i>This issue will not go away if ignored. It will simply create a quagmire
</I>&gt;<i>of different legal verbiage and restrictions that could cripple the
</I>&gt;<i>potential of a great concept. Please give serious consideration to
</I>&gt;<i>establishing your IP standards.
