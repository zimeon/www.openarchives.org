<PRE>Hello all,


I have a question about OAI and its relationship to intellectual
property concerns that I sense might arise - that is, if not 
beaten back with explicit legal disclaimers on the part of 
OAI data providers. This is not a hypothetical interest.


One of the most important things about OAI (to my mind) is
that it explicitly promulgates a principle I call &quot;metadata
transparency&quot; - that organizations who want to make their 
information accessible to as broad a range of users as possible
will make metadata accessible for harvesting by a potentially
equally large range of organizations that want to build 
interfaces to these contents. This is very appealling and
has great applicability for many communities.


The problem I am wrestling with is that what happens
if an organization builds an OAI repository and then 
makes a claim that they hold the intellectual property 
rights to the repository?

Under recent WIPO treaties, this would seem to be a 
legitimate claim since aggregates of fact or data like this
can be considered &quot;original works&quot;. If this is so, 
might it not stop other organizations from aggregating 
the same data (perhaps to build a competing data service 
with some prettier interface or better whizbangs)? 


I know this goes counter to most definitions of &quot;open&quot; 
and that really a repository built upon metadata made 
freely accessible SHOULD not do such a thing, but what 
protection is there for a data provider to ensure that
such as situation does not occur? 


Should OAI have some sort of GNU-like license that should
be signed onto that would preclude service providers 
from unfairly exploiting open archives to the detriment
of others? From the OAI perspective, what IP would a 
service provider have claims to?


I look forward to your comments with interest.


Regards,

-terry
