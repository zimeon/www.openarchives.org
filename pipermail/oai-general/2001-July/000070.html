<PRE>hi

i agree to some degree with many people in this discussion ... the
reason why OAI needs to stay out of IP recommendations is that the
Initiative needs to adopt a non-partisan stance so as to promote
widespread adoption of the underlying principles behind the technology.

that said, not supporting a single baseline IP statement is one approach
to achieve this ... another would be to specify a range of possible IP
statements as baselines and i would like for us to investigate the
feasibility of doing this ...

would it be possible for us to specify a small set of standard
statements that are strong enough to serve as a superset statement list
?

for example, if an IP statement said &quot;xyz&quot; then it does not necessarily
preclude the possibility of some or all of the metadata having looser
restrictions ... any data provider that conforms to &quot;xyz&quot; may harvest
the the metadata ... but data providers that are willing to read the
individual statements and weigh the legalities are also welcome at their
own peril to implement &quot;looser-than-xyz&quot; policies ...

i also recommend a simple controlled vocabulary with correspondences to
rights statements that are listed as a supplemental tech document on the
OAI site ... something along the lines of:

&quot;completely free&quot; = &quot;All metadata and associated data may be used
without restriction by any commercial or non-commercial entity for free
access or resale&quot;
&quot;metadata publicly free&quot; = &quot;All metadata may be used without restriction
by any commercial or non-commercial entity, but may not be further
propagated in a non-value-added form for profit&quot;
...

now i know people are going to say this is too complex ... i dont think
it is ... with a little careful wording we can cover most cases with a
few statements ... and a controlled vocabulary will make it so much
easier for service providers to abide by the data providers' policies
...
