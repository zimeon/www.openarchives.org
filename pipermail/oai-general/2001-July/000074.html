<PRE>Well, you can pay Inktomi about 25 cents per record to crawl your 
site. In the current economic environment, you won't find much 
interest from the mainstream search engines unless they add to the 
bottom line.

Google is probably the most sophisticated crawler. Google ignores all 
metadata that you provide it, on the reasonable assumption that all 
webmasters stuff keywords to try to rig search results. Google will 
follow a link into a DL; having a fixed, unique URL for each item 
will maximize traffic from google.

Google has roots in the Stanford DL program, an approach them from 
that direction.

You can see the results of our &quot;overtures to the webcrawling 
community&quot;. Search for &quot;the origins of chinese communism&quot; at google.

Northern Light is probably a good first target for outreach because 
they build specialty search engines.

Danny Sullivan's  Search Engine Watch. at 
<A HREF="http://www.searchenginewatch.com/">http://www.searchenginewatch.com/</A> is a good place to learn more. 
Getting Danny interested in OAI would  be a good way to reach out to 
this community.
