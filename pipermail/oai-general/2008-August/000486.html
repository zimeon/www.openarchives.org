<PRE>(Apologies for Cross Posting)

Make a place in your diaries for the next OAI workshop: OAI6, the 6th
Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication, which will be held
in Geneva, Switzerland:

Wednesday 17th to Friday 19th June 2009.

The workshop will follow the successful format of previous workshops
mixing practical tutorials, presentations from cutting-edge projects and
research, discussion groups, posters, and an intense social programme to
maximise interaction and communication. It will be possible to register
for a part or all of the programme.

The workshop is aimed at those involved in the development of open
access (OA) repositories and who can influence the direction of
developments either within their institution, their country or at an
international level - that includes technical developers of OA
bibliographic databases and connected services, research information
policy developers at university or library level, funding bodies
concerned with access to the results of their research, OA publishers,
and influential researchers keen to lead OA developments in their own
field.

Previous workshops have built a strong community spirit and the event is
a unique opportunity to exchange ideas and contact details with the wide
range of people connected to the OA movement. The OAI series of
workshops is one of the biggest international meetings in this field and
takes place roughly every two years.

Further information will be added to this web site, including programme
details, a registration form, a call for posters, and accommodation and
travel advice. The 2009 workshop will be held at a larger venue
belonging to the University of Geneva (UniGe) who we welcome as
co-organisers of this event. Future announcements may be made directly
from the UniGe organisers. Some slides of the new venue can be seen
here:

The committee looks forward to welcoming you to Geneva next year for
another successful event.
