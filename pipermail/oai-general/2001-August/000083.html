Dear Colin, 

I am forwarding your query to the OAI and Eprints lists as yours is a
technical question and has already had some thought and discussion
devoted to it.

I would note, in passing, that by far the most pressing objective at
this time is not that of devising the optimal indexing system for
the Eprint Archives (though that can be accomplished) but that of
getting CONTENT into those archives, as soon as possible (so that,
if you like, there will be the data to optimize the indexing FOR!).

So my own feeling is that it is putting the cart before the horse to
worry too much about indexing still-near-empty archives! The growing
content itself, and its growing use, will drive the further
optimizations in indexing and retrieval, not the other way round.

But inasmuch as worries about indexing may be delaying some people's
self-archiving, by all means let us make a robust and general indexing
system available, so that particular retardant, at least, is behind us
and we can get on with it...

If ANU soes indeed have tens of thousands of articles in its Eprint
Archives soon, it will already have taken a huge step for the entire
research community, showing the way for all!

Best wishes,

Stevan
