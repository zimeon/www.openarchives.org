Subject: [OAI-general] Availability of Arc source code
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.10.10209091439470.25551-100000@defiant.cs.odu.edu>

Dear all,

The Digital Library Group in Old Dominion University is pleased to
announce the availability of Arc through SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/oaiarc/). Arc is released under the NCSA
Open Source License.  Arc is a federated search service based on the Open
Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).  It
includes a harvester which can harvests both OAI-PMH 1.x and 2.0 compliant
repositories, a search engine together with a simple and advanced search
interface, and an OAI-PMH layer over harvested metadata. It is based on
Java Servlet technology and requires JDK1.4, Tomcat 4.0x, and a RDBMS
server (tested with Oracle and MySQL).

Arc can be configured for a specific community, We encourage the community
to participate in (besides using), extending and enhancing  Arc by
providing support for parallel metada set specific to different
communities, enhancing and customizing search interface, adding post
processing etc. A demonstration instantiation is running at
http://arc.cs.odu.edu, it currently harvests some 100 OAI-PMH compliant
repositories. 

regards,

Xiaoming Liu

Subject: [OAI-general] Services providers in economic subjects
Message-ID: <3.0.5.32.20020911114951.00942e30@chiara.eco.unibs.it>

Dear collegues,
here in Brescia (Italy), we are playing with the idea to set up an OAIMHP
complyant e-print archive as data providers. I would like to know if
services providers in economic subjects already exist or are about to
spring up.

Many thanks
Luca Guerra

* Interoperability is a key theme of work at our Digital Library
Research Laboratory, which has home page http://www.dlib.vt.edu/

* One project is called Open Digital Libraries. This is the focus of the
PhD work of Hussein Suleman. He should graduate late this year and then
move into a teaching or research position.  See the link
http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/odl/. We invite others to make use of the
components there, and to help add into the suite of tools to promote
interoperability. I'll give a paper on this at ECDL next week.

* Building on the ODL effort is the DL in a box effort. See
http://dlbox.nudl.org/. This is part of the work we are undertaking with
support from NSDL.  The PI on the overall project is
	Su-shing Chen [suchen@cise.ufl.edu]
Our other co-PI is
	Joe Futrelle [futrelle@ncsa.uiuc.edu]
The  DL in a box effort aims toward a collection of components,
functioning in a coherent framework, that can be adapted by groups, such
as those in the Collection Track of NSDL (www.nsdl.org).

* For more general info on digital libraries, see a collection of web
pages from
	http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~dlib/rcontents.htm
Or see key sites like www.dlib.org

* A good reference is
A. Paepcke, C. K. Chang, H. Garcia-Molina, and T. Winograd:

ACM 41:4, pp. 33-43, 1998

Subject: [OAI-general] ARTISTE OAI Repository
Message-ID: <0016E6145796E14680B831BB76A2129E0442CA@mailserver.it-innovation.soton.ac.uk>

ARTISTE is a European Commission supported project that has developed integrated content and metadata-based image retrieval across several major art galleries in Europe.  Collaborating galleries include the Louvre in Paris, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence and the National Gallery in London. 

To address issues of interoperability between digital image collections and other important resources of digital cultural information such as digital library collections and the emerging semantic web, ARTISTE supports open standards of information retrieval including the OAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol (v1.1). 

A public version of the ARTISTE containing 1000 images from the Victoria and Albert Museum is now available and can be accessed using OAI-PMH by specifying the base URL http://artiste.it-innovation.soton.ac.uk/servlet/OAIServlet. 

A dedicated web interface to the ARTISTE OAI Repository is also available at http://artiste.it-innovation.soton.ac.uk/oai_home.html. 
More information about the ARTISTE project, the implemented support for OAI and other open standards for information retrieval is available here http://www.it-innovation.soton.ac.uk/artiste/.  The same site also contains information about the SCULPTEUR project which is building on the work of ARTISTE, and as part of the which we hope to update OAI support to v2.0.

We would welcome your feedback and hope you enjoy exploring ARTISTE.

Regards

Alison Stevenson
