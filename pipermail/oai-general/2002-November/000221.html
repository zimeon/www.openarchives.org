Gee, after all this time they cannot spell my name right! &lt;:-(

Anyway, my involvement has tapered off a little bit due to work
commitments in the last month or so, but just saying this is me,
and so happy to try to answer any questions on this (OAI) list if
you dont want to go off to the ZING list - within reason of course,
as I am sure people don't want the OAI list becoming a second ZING
list. I hope to find a bit of time to have a go at implementing
a SRW and SRU API to my OAI repository for example, if people
were interested.
