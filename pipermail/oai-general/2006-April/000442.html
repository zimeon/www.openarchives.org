JCDL 2006
**Metadata Tools for Digital Resource Repositories Workshop**
	Thursday, June 15, 2006, 8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m.


This is an open call to participate in the Metadata Tools for Digital
Resource Repositories Workshop
(<A HREF="http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/jcdl_2006_tools_workshop.html">http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/jcdl_2006_tools_workshop.html</A>) at JCDL:  2006 in
Chapel Hill, NC, USA.


**Workshop Description**

Metadata tools are vital for DLs (digital library) and digital resource
repository growth. Sharable ontologies and metadata schemas supporting a
wide range of functions have helped initiate tool development. The DL
community needs to share developments, knowledge, and evaluation
methodologies specific to DL metadata tools. This workshop will facilitate
dialog among people interested in metadata tools including, but not limited
to users, tool developers, and companies. The workshop seeks to improve
communication in the DL/metadata tool community and advance the
state-of-the-art for tools in this environment. Specific objectives are
to:

1. Communicate challenges and solutions specific DL metadata tools and
software, including metadata creation, management, preservation, display,
and retrieval issues.

2. Exhibit a range of tools developed to aid creators, managers, and users
of information systems, specifically in their work with metadata schemas
and vocabularies.

3. Foster discussion between software developers, DL leaders, digital
collection managers and application users.


**Participation &amp; Exhibitors Call**

Participation is open for general workshop attendance. We invite users,
researchers, tool developers and companies. We are also seeking
