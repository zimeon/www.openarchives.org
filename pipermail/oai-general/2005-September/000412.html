ELPUB 2006: Digital Spectrum: Integrating Technology and Culture 10th
International Conference on Electronic Publishing
14 to 16 June 2006, Bansko (Bulgaria)

<A HREF="http://www.elpub.net">http://www.elpub.net</A>  &lt;<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/mailman/listinfo/oai-general">elpub2006 at elpub.net</A>&gt;

*** Deadlines for submission in all categories: November 21st 2005 ***

The ELPUB 2006 conference will keep the tradition of the nine previous
international conferences on electronic publishing, held in the United
Kingdom (in 1997 and 2001), Hungary (1998), Sweden (1999), Russia (2000),
the Czech Republic (2002), Portugal (2003), Brazil (2004) and Belgium
(2005), which is to bring together researchers, lecturers, librarians,
developers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, managers, users and all those
interested on issues regarding electronic publishing in widely differing
contexts. These include the human, cultural, economic, social,
technological, legal, commercial and other relevant aspects that such an
exciting theme encompasses.

Three distinguished features of this conference are: broad scope of topics
which creates a unique atmosphere of active exchange and learning about
various aspects of electronic publishing;  combination of general and
technical tracks; and a condensed procedure of submission, revision and
publication of proceedings which guarantees presentations of most recent
work.
ELPUB 2006 offers a variety of activities, such as workshops, tutorials,
panel debates etc. Thus, the conference attendees will benefit from:

        -   The communication of scientific papers specially prepared for
the conference;
            all papers are to be reviewed and accepted by the international
ELPUB Programme Committee;
        -   Workshops and tutorials that aim to provide opportunity for
attendants to update themselves in
             topics of high interest within this community of experts;
        -   Plenary sessions that aim to summarise the main ideas
presented and discussed
            during the presentation of the conference papers;
        -   Panel debates on selected topics; possible topics include news
item publishing
             or new methods, including Open Access, for publishing
scientific literature;
        -   Demonstration sessions and presentation of posters.
