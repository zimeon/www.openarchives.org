Terminology is terminology, but calling one's own archiving of one's own
papers "self-archiving" sure sounds like calling a spade a spade...

Besides, the Open Archives Initiative (OAI http://www.
openarchives.org) has informed me in no uncertain terms that I should
NOT characterize self-archiving as open-archiving or vice versa. The
OAI is a much broader initiative than the self-archiving initiative.

OAI is dedicated to providing shared interoperability standards for the
entire on-line digital literature, whether self-archived or not,
whether for-free or for-fee, whether journal, book or other, whether
full-text or not, whether centralized or distributed.

It is true that the OAI was originally proposed as the "UPS" (Universal
Preprint Service), which was indeed a form of self-archiving (though a
limited form, focussing on the unrefereed preprint rather than on both
the unrefereed preprint and the refereed postprint, as self-archiving
does). But "UPS" was quickly dropped and the OAI has since vastly
outgrown those limited original objectives.

On-Line archives (apart from the Physics arXiv) are all but non-existent.

The hope is that institution-based, distributed self-archiving (perhaps
with the newfound help of the http://www.eprints.org archive-creating
software) will now remedy this.

And, as I said above, even in Physics, self-archiving is still growing
too slowly to free the Physics literature in less than a decade. It
seems to me that the central self-archiving model, admirable and
welcome though it is, can use all the help it can get.

> o in mathematics, a politically appealing distraction, and

I have no idea why you mention politics. The only "appeal" is to
researchers, that they should free their refereed research from their
obsolete access- and impact-barriers by self-archiving it, now. I have
no "political" preference for their doing it the central way or the
distributed way: We should all just go ahead and DO it!

I used to lean towards central self-archiving myself, seeing no reason
why it should not all be subsumed under arXiv; but that just isn't
happening, and the clock is ticking; so it's time to add more powerful
and general means of self-archiving.

Besides, the whole point of OAI-compliance and interoperability is that
it should no longer MATTER which way you self-archive: centrally or
institutionally. It's all harvestable into the same global virtual
archive anyway, thanks to the OAI protocol.

Unless one's "political" objective becomes, publisher-like, to protect
one's own proprietary (centralized?) turf instead of to free the
research literature...

I have no idea what you mean by the above.

Nobody is trying to "match" anything. We are trying to free the research
literature, as quickly and as effectively as possible.

I really can't follow any of this, and I have no idea who you think is
competing with whom for what:

ResearchIndex/CiteSeer is a wonderful tool, harvesting and
citation-linking papers on the Web, whether in OAI-compliant archives
or not. As the OAI-compliant corpus grows (with the growth of central
and distributed self-archiving), ResearchIndex/CiteSeer's harvest will
grow, and surely we all welcome that!

I don't know what you have in mind with "bureaucratic standards," but you
need not sell me on search-engine intelligence: I love it already.

Moreover, as the OAI-compliant corpus grows, it will spawn still
further and more powerful Open Archive Service Providers (e.g., OpCit
http://opcit.eprints.org and ARC http://arc.cs.odu.edu/).

But the main goal now is to do whatever can be done to make that corpus
grow into the full refereed literature in all disciplines as soon as
possible. This is not the time to squabble over who has the best
current archive or search engine...

Fine. But before you can make the on-line research literature
interoperable across disciplines you have to get it on-line (and free)!
And if central, discipline-based self-archiving is not freeing it
on-line anywhere near fast enough, it's time to give the institutional
route a go, with the help of OAI interoperability.

From: ePrints Support (Christopher Gutteridge) <support@eprints.org>
Subject: Multiple language Support for Eprints.

eprints.org is beginning to gain some multi-language functionality.

I plan to have "language" files with all the phrases used by eprints in
them. I will maintain an English version, and arrange to make it as
easy as possible to create/maintain other languages - hopefully a
script to compare any language file with the english file and spot any
missing phrases etc.

It's time-consuming applying this change, but also easy. It will take a
while to get the whole code done.

The advantage of this method is that although each eprint.org archive
will have a default language, a user could view the CGI scripts in any
language supported, using cookies or something!

I'm currently considering how to make the static pages support multiple
languages... I'm considering mod_rewrite using the same cookie. I think
static pages are a slightly different issue from the main code, as
people will want to customise those, and customising in more than one
language will be more than most people, especially anglocentric ones,
will want to do.

The other issue is the "help" in the metadata cfg section and various
blocks of english text in the site routines.=20

Some of SiteInfo.pm may go from:

$EPrintsSite::SiteInfo::blurb =3D "This is some blurb only in english";

to

$EPrintsSite::SiteInfo::blurb{english} =3D "This is some blurb only in engl=
ish";

With the option to add any language you support; how does this sound?

My main concern is not making any significant extra work to deploy
eprints.org for people who DON'T care about this issue.

Please see the attached file for an example of a language file - this
is only somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 of the final length I'm
expecting.

I'd be keen for some of you to at least have a go at translating some
of this so I've got some french (and other language) text to work with
(I'm afraid I am a monoglot). Also let me know if there is anything
good/bad about the way that I've organised it.

The file is organised by the file which uses the phrase. Eg. User.pm
Each line has a ID for the phrase eg:

H:thanks =3D Thank-you. Your paper named $(1) is now in the system.

"H" indicates that this will be displayed as HTML so &aacute; etc are
acceptable. Other types, "M" for example, will need different escaping
of such characters, or they may be altogether illegal.

Rather than split a sentence into two phrases, the system inserts data
into the points at $(1) $(2) etc...

I would be very grateful if you could help announce a survey we are
conducting on current users and non-users of Eprint Archives.

    http://www.eprints.org/survey/

The purpose of the survey is to determine who is and is not using such
archives at this time, how they use them if they do, why they do not
use them if they do not, and what features they would like to have
added to them to make them more useful. (The survey is anonymous.
Revealing your identity is optional and it will be kept confidential.)

The survey consists of about 72 web-based questions, and comes in four
versions:

PHYSICISTS, ASTROPHYSICISTS, MATHEMATICIANS

    1. arXiv Users

    2. arXiv Non-Users

COGNITIVE SCIENTISTS (Psychologists, Neuroscientists, Behavioral
Biologists, Computer Scientists [AI/robotics/vision/speech/learning],
Linguists, Philosophers)

    3. CogPrints Users

    4. CogPrints Non-Users

OTHER DISCIPLINES: Please use either 2. or 4.

Hello OAI-General List:

I'm looking for some information in general 'layman's terms' what your
organization is doing with regard to exchange of scholarly writings.

Let me explain myself.  Perhaps that may give a clue about where my
questions originate.  I am wondering if our organization, Brookhaven
National Laboratory and specifically our Information Services Division (ISD
which encompasses the Research Library where I work),  might either benefit
from participation in what you are doing or might be a pertinent information
source for you.

I am not a librarian, nor am I a scientist.  I am a systems specialist who
works with relational databases in a research library.  Part of my function
is to maintain a repository of both metadata and content of various
publications related to the pursuit of federally-funded research and
development activities.  I work with both UNIX and NT based systems; I've
worked extensively in data manipulation activities to include UNIX
utilities, perl, cgi scripting in shell and perl, SGML and HTML.   I've
dabbled with XML.  I understand the concepts of DTDs and parsing.  I
partially understand your specification from the protocol for metadata
harvesting.  I've read much at your site.

Would someone be able to provide me with an outline of how OAI might be of
benefit to us?   Or how we might contribute?  Have you a public affairs
representative perhaps?

I appreciate any and all information you might provide.

Thank you.

Patricia,

You're right - this should probably be covered in a FAQ or something.

Putting on my NASA hat, I can say what we get out of OAI participation.

I'm responsible for:

http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/
and 
http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/

though I'm less involved with the latter now.  The goal of these DLs it to
have maximum exposure for their contents.   I'd say their respective
interfaces are functional, but surely others could do a better job.  My
focus is mainly on making as much LaRC / NACA content as possible is
available on line.  To that end, both of the above have OAI interfaces:

http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/oai/
http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/oai/

So others can harvest our metadata and include them in their own service
provder (which points back to the "data" (full text reports in this case)
at our DLs).

Ultimately, OAI harvesting is the "right" way to build services such as:

http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/NTRS
(which I'm resposible for) and:

http://www.osti.gov/bridge/

and other services.  And if you don't like those interfaces, you can build
your own service provider, and it can target the OAI archives of your
choosing.  An example of an OAI compliant service provider is:

http://arc.cs.odu.edu/

Which does some neat things with using Oracle and session mgmt for quick
searching.  Not satisfied?  Build your own service provider and use a
different search engine (or a totally different resource discovery
metaphor, if you'd like).

It would be nice to have an OAI interface to:

http://www.inform.bnl.gov/pubsearch/

so the contents therein could be discovered through alternate
interfaces.  I'm guessing the only current way to find:

http://www.pubs.bnl.gov/pubs/documents/21099.pdf

is through through http://www.inform.bnl.gov/pubsearch/ ....

it would be nice if people searching http://arc.cs.odu.edu could find it,
or perhaps people searching a DOE-specific service provider (OSTI?), or
perhaps a through a service provider run by the Sierra Club (for example),
which selectively harvested this report (and related reports) for their
constituency interested in the environmental planning of government
research laboratories.

In summary, the advantages of participating as a data provider are mostly
about increased visibility of your contents.  You can use the OAI protocol
to easily build things like selective dissemination of information,
alerts, update services, etc., but these projects seem to me to be related
to the "increased visibility" result.

If BNL wanted to construct a serivce provider, it could easily harvest
from other sources to build (for example) a specialized service directly
targeted for your customer base.  Or you could decide you can do a better
job ofa general service provider than OSTI and build your own ;-)

Let me know if you have any questions.

regards,

Michael
