OPEN REPOSITORIES 2008: CALL FOR POSTERS
http://www.openrepositories.org/2008

We invite developers, researchers and practitioners to submit 2-page poster 
proposals describing novel experiences or developments in the construction and 
use of repositories.

Repositories are being deployed in a variety of settings (research, 
scholarship, learning, science, cultural heritage) and across a range of scales 
(subject, national, regional, institutional, project, lab, personal). The aim 
of this conference is to address the technical, managerial, practical and 
theoretical issues that arise from diverse applications of repositories in the 
increasingly pervasive information environment.

A programme of papers, panel discussions, poster presentations, user groups, 
tutorials and developer coding sessions will bring together all the key 
stakeholders in the field. Open source software community meetings for the 
major platforms (EPrints, DSpace and Fedora) will also provide opportunities to 
advance and co-ordinate the development of repository installations across the 
world.

IMPORTANT DATES AND CONTACT INFO
Submission Deadline: Monday 4th February 2008
Conference: April 1-4, 2008. University of Southampton, UK.

Enquiries to: Program Committee Chair (e.lyon -- ukoln.ac.uk) or General Chair 
(lac -- ecs.soton.ac.uk)

Apologies for cross-posting

A meeting will be held on April 4, 2008 at the University of 
Southampton, in conjunction with Open Repositories 2008, to roll-out the 
beta release of the OAI-ORE specifications. This meeting is the European 
follow-on to a meeting that will be held in the USA on March 3, 2008 at 
Johns Hopkins University.

The OAI-ORE specifications describe a data model to identify and 
describe aggregations of web resources, and they introduce 
machine-readable formats to describe these aggregations based on ATOM 
and RDF/XML. The current, alpha version of the OAI-ORE specifications is 
  at http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.1/ .

Additional details for the OAI-ORE European Open Meeting are available at:
