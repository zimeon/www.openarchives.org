Dear OAI-General list,
I am forwarding the Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in 
Archaeology (CAA) 2006 conference online registration announcement 
posted by the CAA2006 Conference Organizing Committee to those who have 
previously signed up for the announcements list.
For those on the OAI-General list who are not aware, the CAA2006 
conference will be held for the first time in North America, at Fargo, 
North Dakota, USA, on April 18-21, 2006.
There will be sessions presentations, symposia, workshops, and 
roundtable panel discussions that cover the use of computer applications 
and quantitative methods in archaeology and related museum studies, 
cultural resources management, and heritage preservation programs, 
inclusive of relevant digital libraries and archives initiatives, such 
as those implementing OAI projects, and we encourage your participation.
The first call for papers, posters, symposia, workshops, and roundtable 
panel discussions will be made within the next two weeks. In the 
meantime, and if you have not already done so, please visit the CAA2006 
conference Web site (http://www.caa2006.org), and sign up for the 
announcements list and register (see information provided below). We 
look forward to seeing you at CAA2006.
