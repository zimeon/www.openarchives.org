Subject: [OAI-general] Publishers approach to self-archiving
Message-ID: <001a01c2866e$6b0aa720$f902b782@zim10>

Dear colleagues, 

at the OAI workshop in Geneva (in October) there was this discussion
that it might be a good idea to establish a list of
"self-archiving-friendly" publishers. Does anyone know if someone has
further developed and pursued this idea?

Currently, we are working on an institutional repository for the Max
Planck Society (eDoc) and we know pretty well that our scientists are
very concerned about copyright and relations to scientific publishers.
This is this reason why we need to provide some information on standard
license agreements which might already exist and allow self-archiving.

I am aware of projects like ROMEO or some remarks of Stevan Harnad on
eprints.org about this issue. I just wanted to know if there might be a
list or a comprehensive collection somewhere on the web which we have
not yet taken into account. 

We would be glad to collect any related information to this issue and
will be very interested in the outcome of the ROMEO-Survey.

Best regards

Subject: [OAI-general] OAI interop site back up - 76 of 126 sites failing
Message-ID: <20021111123738.C21187@io.mds.rmit.edu.au>

Hi all,

I tried to be clever when upgrading the test collection I build,
and of course managed to mess it up completely. Rather than
restore from backup, I decided to start afresh to clean up the
logs etc too.

So I now have a fresh new database harvested from 126
other sites, with log messages of things that went wrong for
76 of the sites. The datbase now has around 1.8 million records.

If you are a data provider and want to check to see if your
collection worked, have a look at

    http://www.teratext.com.au:8123/public/log;collection=OAI

There is a drop down list of all the data provider names. I am afraid
I fiddled with many of the names to group them more nicely in my list.
In hind site, this was probably a mistake. They are not repository names,
they are not the names listed on the www.openarchives.org site.

If you want to go straight to your site, put your name from the list
below at the end of the following URL (remove the '...')

    http://www.teratext.com.au:8123/public/log;collection=OAI;dataSource=...

(Note: you can navigate from the home page http://www.teratext.com.au:8123/
to the above URLs - just trying to save people time.)

Here is a list of sites that I think are working:

DARE: a new age in the provision of academic information

With the award of a NAP grant of 2 million euros for the period 2003-2006,
the Dutch government is giving a strong boost to innovation in the provision
of academic information in the Netherlands. DARE (Digital Academic
Repositories) is a collective initiative by the Dutch universities to make
all their research results digitally accessible. The Koninklijke Bibliotheek
[Royal Library], the Koninklijke Nederlandse Academie van Wetenschappen
[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences] and the Nederlandse
Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) [Netherlands Organisation
for Scientific Research] are also collaborating on this unique project.
Coordination is being taken care of by the SURF Foundation, the ICT
partnership organisation for higher education and research in the
Netherlands.

DARE anticipates developments in the provision of academic information, in
which information and communications technology has come to play a dominant
role. DARE is modernising the management of Dutch academic information by
putting an infrastructure system in place and providing advanced services
for the digital recording, accessing, storage and distribution of the Dutch
academic output. This will greatly improve the visibility of and access to
the academic output. This is being done in the same way at all the
institutions, each institution retaining its individual responsibility and
exercising its own management, without duplication in storage and in the
maintenance efforts. The standards used are robust in relation to future
advances and are closely aligned with international developments, enabling
the information to be exchanged nationally and internationally in a highly
efficient way. Digital availability, based on open, international standards,
simplifies the further use of the information for various purposes. Examples
are publication in traditional or new journals (including electronic ones),
long-term storage at the Koninklijke Bibliotheek [Royal Library], inclusion
in the NWO's Open Sources system and incorporation in digital learning
environments for the future.

In the present situation, the visibility of and access to Dutch academic
research leave much to be desired. In the fast-changing world of academic
research and communications, changes are needed if the Netherlands wants to
maintain its position in the academic world. Linking up with international
developments in this area, such as the Open Archives Initiative, is crucial.
A national effort to achieve  this is needed. 

In DARE, all the parties concerned are combining forces and existing
smaller-scale projects are being brought together. Enhanced accessibility to
their research will benefit the public profile of Dutch scholars and
universities. With DARE, the Dutch institutions for university education and
research will be better able to create a framework to fulfil their social
responsibility for recording, providing access to and efficiently utilising
their research. In this way the institutions, and their scholars, will be
able to take up their positions in a better and more efficient way in the
rapidly changing world of the provision of academic information.

SURF
SURF is the ICT collaboration organisation for higher education and research
in the Netherlands. The universities and hogescholen (universities of
professional education) collaborate in SURF regarding ICT developments in
the areas of ICT and Research, Education and Organisation, and regarding the
networkinfrastructur of SURFnet and the software licences of SURFdiensten.

Message-ID: <OF85AFC745.C3A52B36-ON85256C71.006C8534@cs.odu.edu>

Dear all,

The Digital Library Research Group at Old Dominion University is pleased to
announce a Rapid Visual OAI Tool (RVOT), which can be used to graphically
construct a OAI-PMH repository from a collection of files. It is available
at  SourceForge:

http://rvot.sourceforge.net/

The records in the original collection can be in any one of the acceptable
formats. The formats currently supported are: RFC1807, Marc (subset), and
COSATI. RVOT helps to define the mapping visually from a native format to
oai_dc format, and once  this is done the tool can respond to OAI-PMH
requests. The tool is self-contained, it comes with a light-weight http
server and OAI-PMH request handler and is written in Java. The design of
RVOT is such that it can be easily extended to support other metadata
formats.  We encourage the community to add support for their formats.

The RVOT has been implemented by Sathish Kumar, a graduate student of
Digital Library Research Group at Old Dominion University.

Maintenance Agency at the Library of Congress, is
pleased to announce Version 1.0 of SRW and CQL.

SRW ("Search/Retrieve for the Web")  is a

access across networked resources, and to promote
interoperability between distributed databases by
providing a common platform. The underpinnings of
the protocol are formed by bringing together more
than 20 years experience from the collective
implementers of the Z39.50 protocol with recent
developments in  the web-technologies arena. SRW
features both SOAP and URL-based access mechanisms
(SRW and SRU respectively) to provide for a wide
range of possible clients.  It uses CQL, the
Common Query Language, which provides a powerful
yet intuitive means of formulating searches. The
protocol mandates the use of open and
industry-supported standards XML and XML Schema,
and where appropriate, Xpath and SOAP.

 The SRW Initiative recognizes the importance of
Z39.50 (as currently defined and deployed) for
business communication, and focuses on getting
information to the user. SRW provides semantics
for searching databases containing metadata and
objects, both text and non-text.  Building on
Z39.50 semantics enables the creation of gateways
to existing Z39.50 systems while reducing the
barriers to new information providers, allowing
them to make their  resources available via a
standard search and retrieve service.

 SRW, SRU, and CQL have been developed by an
international team, minimizing cross-language
pitfalls and other potential internationalization
problems.  Participants include:

 Theo van Veen, Koninlijke Bibliotheek
 Mike Taylor, independent consultant
 Pat Stevens, OCLC
 Rob Sanderson, Liverpool University
 Ralph LeVan, OCLC
 Allan Kent, RMIT University
 Ian Ibbotson, Knowledge Integration
 Poul Henrik Jorgensen, Portia
 Sebastian Hammer, IndexData
 Janifer Gatenby, PICA
 Matthew J. Dovey, Oxford University
 Larry Dixson, Library of Congress
 Adam Dickmeiss, Index Data
 Ray Denenberg, Library of Congress

 The Z39.50 Maintenance Agency home page is at
http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency.

The SRW and CQL version 1.0 specifications will
remain stable for a six- to nine-month
implementation-experience period. During this
period developers are encouraged to implement the
specification (see the implementors page at
http://www.loc.gov/srw/implementors.html), join
the list of implementors, participate in
interoperability testing, and help develop the
next version, 1.1.  Please direct questions,
comments, and suggestions to z3950@loc.gov.

Please feel free to forward this announcement to
other lists as appropriate.

The UK JISC-funded RoMEO Project is pleased to announce that the first
version of their listing of academic journal copyright agreements is now
available from
http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/ls/disresearch/romeo/index.html

The list provides information about 70 journal publishers self-archiving
policies.  Entries in green indicate that self-archiving is allowed.  The
Project would warmly welcome more copyright transfer agreements to add to
the list.  If you know of any (either recent printed copies or URLs) then
I'd be grateful if you could contact me.

A full analysis of the agreements will be available from the RoMEO project
in the new year.  In future the project hopes to work with the University of
Cincinnati's Academic Journal Policy Portal to provide searchable access to
this, and other related, information.

Best
Elizabeth

The Rights (ROMEO) Project has provided an extremely valuable list,
and I hope it will keep growing. But in some cases one hand may not yet
know what the other is doing, because as these policies are evolving as
we speak. (Fortunately, these are cases where the policy is in fact more
progressive than indicated in the list). An example is the entry for the
American Psychological Association: Their copyright transfer form (and
whoever responded to the ROMEO query) does not yet mention it, but there is
also: http://www.apa.org/journals/posting.html referring specifically to
"Posting Articles on the Internet."

It would also be good to add the known policies of publishers who have
not yet replied to the questionnaire. Some are listed at:
http://www.eprints.org/self-faq/#publishers-do
including: APA (more progressive than listed) and Elsevier (directly)

Gee, after all this time they cannot spell my name right! <:-(

Anyway, my involvement has tapered off a little bit due to work
commitments in the last month or so, but just saying this is me,
and so happy to try to answer any questions on this (OAI) list if
you dont want to go off to the ZING list - within reason of course,
as I am sure people don't want the OAI list becoming a second ZING
list. I hope to find a bit of time to have a go at implementing
a SRW and SRU API to my OAI repository for example, if people
were interested.
