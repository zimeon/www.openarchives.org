Message-ID: <20020109193614.B13872@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

EPRINTS-2-ALPHA-2 released (09/01/2002)

EPrints is free software for creating large web-based archives 
of papers (or whatever you want) with the metadata stored in an
SQL back end. 

EPrints v1 is in use by a number of sites (see eprints.org)
for a list. Using our own ideas and feedback from users we have
created eprints-2. This is only an alpha release so not all the
features work yet (that would be beta), but the main parts of 
the system are complete. 

EPrints-2 new features:
  - multilanguage support (site in french & english if you 
      really wanted), option to have multilingual metadata - 
      eg. the title and abstract in english & french and 
      presented in the language of the user viewing.
  - XML configuration files rather than ASCII - a bit harder
      to get started but ensures no ambiguity and lets you
      have non-ASCII characters.
  - OO design. Although the functions are not fixed in stone
      the system has been built to be strictly OO (well, as
      strict as PERL will let it be) and it will be possible 
      to build your own scripts to process the database without
      having to start using SQL.
  - The phrase files used for internationalisation are also 
      useful to customise the interface without having to hack
      the code.
  - Much of the website look and feel is done with style-sheets,
      again to avoid the need for hacking the code.
  - Support for other authentication methods eg. LDAP using 3rd
      party modules currently available.
  - Abstraction of the SQL.
  - configurable searches (what fields do you want to be
     offered as user search pages?)

A couple of notable features which are not yet implemented:
  - alerts - users can configure a once-a-week (or whatever)
    search and be mailed if any new items appear in it each
    week.
  - OAI support. This is very important to us, but is not on
    the critical path to making the software work. It will be
    added in a later version. 

If you really can't wait the software is available online from:     
http://www.eprints.org/files/eprints2/eprints2-alpha-2.tar.gz
But you should be aware that it requires apache with some
configuration options to run effiently + some other freely 
available software such as MySQL. Install info is included in
the .tar.gz in the docs dir.

I welcome and look forward to comments, abuse, praise, bug-
reports etc.

The EPrints.org 2 server is being developed at the University
of Southampton. Mostly by me, Christopher Gutteridge, with a bit
of help from Mike Jewell.

I have branched this more widely because the question is important:

OPSIS has been funded by JISC/JCEI/DNER (1) to continuously upgrade the
Eprints code, fixing bugs, adding enhancements, and keeping it
compliant with OAI upgrades, (2) to provide support for Universities
adopting it and (3) to open-source the code.

Eprints is funded by JISC/JCEI/DNER for a year as the OPSIS project, but it
is also receiving some support from its sister project, OPCIT (funded by
JISC/Elib as well as NSF for what is now the 3rd of 3 years).

Eprints has been doing very well so far and I don't think it should
have any difficulty in finding further funding. What ensures its
longevity is increasing collective utilisation (and hence commitment)
by the academic community worldwide. This means increasing adoption of
the Eprints software for institutional self-archiving by universities,
in the first instance, but, even more important, the exercise of
systematic and energetic measures by the universities to ensure that
their Eprints archives are filled by their researchers. 

The longevity of Eprints is a legitimate concern. But creating an
ever greater momentum to fill university Eprints archives is an
even more substantive concern, and success in meeting it is the best
way to meet the first concern as well. 

So I would say, yes, let those who have adopted Eprints and are relying
on it already make their voices heard on the importance of sustaining
Eprints, but, even more important, let them put as much concerted
effort as possible into filling their own existing archives, as well as
encouraging the creation of further archives. The very best argument
for funding sustained support is strong evidence of a growing portion
of our intellectual eggs being consigned to this collective basket.

Hi again,

Thanks for the contributions from Chris, Mike and Stevan.

I agree totally - it's a case of making a commitment and jumping in at the 
deep end. However, there's an element of Catch-22 here. Eprints will be 
sustainable if ePrints is successful. But ePrints will be (more) successful 
if we can show it to be sustainable....we have to get over the initial hump.

More specifically, the problem is that at local institutional level not 
everybody is ready for an eprint commitment. We are going through a process 
of education and persuasion in order to convince people that what we are 
engaged in is a feasible and legitimate activity that will provide an 
important long-term service. This involves a number of issues, and Stevan 
for one has provided plenty of good arguments to deploy.

What we're developing here is another argument, being able to point to the 
underlying tools and say that these are going to be available, stable, and 
supported for many years to come. Having these contributions from 
Christopher, Mike and Stevan certainly makes it easier for me to make a 
case here at Strathclyde, and I imagine this applies elsewhere.

Cheers,

Bob

One issue in the design of eprints-2 is that it is geared up to allow
many (smaller) archives to be run on one physical computer. Which means
that a larger organisation could buy one "chunky" computer and then
provide eprints archives with seperate customisations, OAI exports (and
colour schemes) for various departments which don't have the resources and
expertise to do this themseleves. This should reduce the cost in parts (and 
system admin hours!) to get several archives going.

I can even imagine, long term, someone offering a "hosting" service for 
a fee where they actually administrate the archive and do the "hard stuff" 
plus own the computer and networking, and look after dull things like backups,
and upgrades. An "archive farm" if you will.

This would probably work out more cost effective than buying and installing
a machine and having learn the ins-and outs of the system for a single
archive. EPrints is free, so we don't have to grub for licenses by requiring
one copy per archive :)

My own server, running eprints-alpha-2, is running demoprints.eprints.org,
eprints.aktors.org + a couple of other test archives. Later, it will be 
running our department publications archive and an archive of Ted Nelsons 
material.

The bottle neck is processor power, caused by larger datasets but mostly
by "hits". So large, popular archives should probably run on their own 
machine.

In addition, should a particular archive become heavily used, moving it to a
dedicated box is a snap. You really loose nothing with a multi-archive
(versus monolith) design, and gain so much. Thanks to OAI protocols,
developing an institute wide interface to all the small archives isn't much
of a hassle -- in fact kinda unnecessary due to ARC
(http://arc.cs.odu.edu/). If you can't tell, I'm a fan of this design.

Some more metrics: on my un-optimized server, eprints/apache/mysql
altogether require about 40MB of memory per archive. Most web hits are from
robots and some from OAI harvesters (as it should be).  We have 10 archives
now, though some are just skeletons waiting for our authors to "see the
light" so to speak.

There is a bothersome implicit assumption in these notes--that an
e-print archive needs to manage (part of) its own servers.

Another possibility is that an archive buy storage and Web services from
one of giant server farm companies that many businesses find practical.
Doing so is likely to have several large advantages over any kind of
"roll your own" (aka RYO) solution: avoided administrative headaches,
automatic capacity management (as alluded to in the attached note), very
short delay between proposal and service delivery, and probably (TBD)
lower cost than RYO.

If someone can identify strong arguments against this proposition, I'd
much enjoy hearing them and perhaps having a friendly debate.

hi

i'll bite :)

without going into the differences between data and metadata management, 
i agree that in general it is much better to outsource archive 
management. however, i am not sure if everyone is in a position to do 
that just yet.

notably, most universities and non-profit organizations do not seem to 
have found a workable business model to sustain DLs with 
manually-enforced quality controls (e.g., peer reviews, editing) and 
still give away the content for free as expected by their users.

so, as a result, it seems some institutions are considering setting up 
institutional archives (and hosting non-institutional archives at 
institutions) to piggyback on the already sizeable technology investment 
and networking infrastructure in the higher education and research sector.

sure, there are problems with this model, including that:-
- it doesn't address non-institutional DLs
- it doesn't scale arbitrarily (once archives get too large 
"piggyback"ing is no longer an option)
- it perpetuates the view that content should be free (i think at least 
some of it should be!)

but, all things considered, i think it will work in the short term until 
we find a better solution :) ... and, it may also work in the long term 
for very specialized areas. in a way, it may bring the advantages of DL 
technology to those "mini-archives" that cannot afford off-site hosting.

just a few thoughts ...

[I've branched this to "eprints-underground" which is a list for non-technical
issues relating to eprints.]

Are there people on these lists at places which could do the technicial 
support & hosting for another archive or would rather pay someone else to 
maintain their archive? It'd be interesting to give this a try, but I just
don't have the time.

(ps. My CVS version of eprints-2 just validated against Hussains OAI 
checker so the next release should have working OAI, which is nice.)

In a business world this might be an ideal solution. In the Universities I
have worked in, there tends to be much less flexibility in the use of cash,
and one quite often ends up making counter-intuitive decisions as a result.
We have an infrastructure to support our library and computing needs; in
theory, adding an e-prints server to this is a marginal issue, but finding
the cash to out-source it would be very definitely not marginal.

>From what I have seen in local discussions, the cost is likely to be
dominated by two other issues. First is the extent to which any kind of
selection process is applied to the material deposited. As an initial stab,
we have decided just to issue general guidelines, but to make no checks. I'm
a little worried this may be irreversible.

The other issue is the time spent depositing papers. We already have to put
references to all published papers into a central database, and there is
great difficulty persuading academics to find the time for this (especially
for their 'back set' of articles). We can't (yet) import that data into the
ePrints.org system we run, which means academics would have to do it twice.
This will limit early adoption to those who care greatly...

The problem that you can get people to do it once, but if you have more than
one database they'll get annoyed and not put the same info in all.

Any "importer" will probably require some in house scripting as there is
unlikely to be a 1-1 mapping from the two metadata sets.

If you control both archives there are some possibilities. What is the other
archive, how is it accessed & updated?

I'm adding a bulk-importer to eprints, but that's probably not what you want.

I've mentioned it before but the biggest goad to getting people to enter 
their information in our departement DB was our "people info pages" eg.
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/info/people/wh
A member of academic staff gets upset if the number of papers they're listed
as having writen is lower than the truth. 

--if you don't care about the eprints.org software stop reading here--
I've added a feature to eprints-2 which creates files containing chunks of 
HTML (similar to the browse subjects in ep-1) but also creates chunks without 
the wrapping template, so these fragments can be exported and included in 
other pages in your site.

The initial test run of this is being used by aktors.org (although they
are exporting it by year rather than by person). See
http://www.aktors.org/publications/Nindex.php3
this is just our first test. The page contains the php code line
readline( "http://eprints.aktors.org/view/year/2001.include" );
The /view/ directory is where all views get generated, currently it also
generates .html versions:
http://eprints.aktors.org/view/year/2001.html
but these could not usefully be imported into another page.
You can even create each item as a table row, but that's more complex
to customise.

In addition, should a particular archive become heavily used, moving it to a
dedicated box is a snap. You really loose nothing with a multi-archive
(versus monolith) design, and gain so much. Thanks to OAI protocols,
developing an institute wide interface to all the small archives isn't much
of a hassle -- in fact kinda unnecessary due to ARC
(http://arc.cs.odu.edu/). If you can't tell, I'm a fan of this design.

Some more metrics: on my un-optimized server, eprints/apache/mysql
altogether require about 40MB of memory per archive. Most web hits are from
robots and some from OAI harvesters (as it should be).  We have 10 archives
now, though some are just skeletons waiting for our authors to "see the
light" so to speak.

I am interested in knowing how can we search using OAI protocal on multiple
parameters like dc.title, dc.creator, dc.language etc. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. 
Thanks,
Paresh

The OAI-PMH (protocol for metadata harvesting) is for metadata harvesting
and does not have search functions. It is envisaged that service-providers
will implement searches and other services. See, for example, 'arc' 
advanced search (http://arc.cs.odu.edu/).

Cheers,
Simeon

There are some efforts of encoding queries in sets parameter, you may
take a look at

Hi,

An observation: if OAI-PMH is an Open protocol, why is it's development (and
the decisions that are being made in that development) not in the public
domain?

(or am I missing something?)

All the best,

Hello,

I am happy that some efforts exist in this direction. Some effort has been
here for some time already (see [1]). I understand the intention to keep
the two modes (searching/harvesting) distinct. But in fact, the way how
the OAI sets are eventually implemented is similar (can be even equal as
it is the case in our repository) to how the set-encapsulated-queries
would be implemented (suggested in referenced paper [2]). When we then
implement OAI-sets and queries inside of them, we are implementing twice
the same thing, using two protocols though.


Regards,
Martin

hi

a few more comments about the searching-over-OAI issue ...

- i think OAI-PMH should always be directed towards harvesting - 
extensions are great, but there must be clean separation. the approach 
we advocate is to separate the archive and extension into distinct 
components. the archive then becomes the data provider, and the 
component an OAI service provider (and a data provider in the context of 
a different protocol  - this different protocol is what we're interested in)

- our solution is meant to be general and extensible (we don't want to 
invent query languages - we want to look into using familiar wrappers) 
the extensibility mechanism also must cover different searching 
strategies and, more generally, other DL requirements beyond searching...

- for a peek at the testbed we have been running for the last 8 months 
now, try http://purl.org/net/etdunion

- you can download and install a reference implementation of the search 
component from http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/odl

- more components are in the works :)
