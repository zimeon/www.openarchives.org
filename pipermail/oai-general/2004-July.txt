Subject: [OAI-general] Fw: Metadata Creation Survey for creating better tools
Message-ID: <052f01c4604e$bba980a0$14207e82@library.uiuc.edu>

While not directly related to the PMH, this will be of interest to many
of us looking at automated and semi-automated approaches to metadata
generation. If you have a few minutes this month to fill out this
survey, it would help insure the quality and completeness of results
reported out to the Library of Congress (among others).

Colleagues/

I am pleased to announce the availability of the revised version of my
PowerPoint presentation from the 
recently concluded WiLSWorld 2004 Conference [
http://www.wils.wisc.edu/events/wworld04/ ]

_Open Content and Access for Digital Scholarship_

"The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
(OAI-PMH) provides an application-independent 
interoperability framework based on metadata harvesting. There are two
classes of participants in the OAI-PMH 
framework: Data Providers and Service Providers. Data Providers
administer systems that support the OAI-PMH 
as a means of exposing metadata from digital collections or
repositories; while Service Providers use metadata harvested 
via the OAI-PMH as a basis for building value-added services.  In this
presentation we will profile several major OAI-PMH Data 
and Service Providers, and describe and discuss their innovative
content, features, and functionalities."


The REVISED and CORRECTED presentation has been self-archived at:

[ http://www.public.iastate.edu/~gerrymck/OpenContent.ppt  ]

BTW:This is a LARGE file  [11MB] and Long Presentation [130+ Slides] 

For your Late-Friday-Afternoon, Late-July Reading-and
-Viewing-Pleasure!

 Enjoy!
