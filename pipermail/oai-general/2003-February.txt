Reading the OAIF article they could've drawn more attention to a very useful
comment:
"[OAI] ... implementations concluded within one-quarter year and by one
programmer ..."
And that a sizeable portion of this is building the system to provide the
metadata (e.g. converting internal formats to DC), and to providing
maintainence - i.e. the costs are more than just providing an OAI/XML
interface.

"About 70% of the tools used to become OAI compatible were self-developed by
Data Providers and Service Providers. Most of the Data Providers and Service
Providers make their tools and source code available for others to use ...
and also used frequently are PHP and XML."

(I think this article could do with a little technical input - every OAI
implementation uses XML, if it doesn't it's not OAI ...)
It would be interesting to know why projects create self-developed
solutions, rather than building on existing tools? Are the existing tools
insufficient, or is OAI seen to be simple enough to be re-implemented?

Does anybody know what has happened with the Cyclades project? It looks very
interesting but the web site appears not to have been updated in over a
year?

I can only comment on what I know but it's a shame they don't mention my own
Citebase as a useful example of extended services - it combines OAI &
full-text harvesting, along with the traditional meta-search. Also not
mentioned Celestial - which provides a 1.x to 2.0 gateway (making which
version of OAI being implemented a mute point).

It would be good to see the success (or not) of projects judged by how much
/content/ they expose, rather than technical achievements. In this respect I
believe Europe is lagging far behind the US - arXiv.org, LoC & OCLC dwarf
most of the other repositories out there. This is a failure to convince
those who control the content that open access is a Good Thing - a challenge
far greater than preservation, metadata formats, or any other technical
issue.

n.b. DSpace isn't as of 2003/02/06 OAI compliant (Repo-Explorer & Celestial
both fail to harvest). When implementing any XML application input should be
checked for bad chars (no control characters, and any >128 characters should
be checked against the Unicode character set).

All the best,
Tim.

My very talented and productive colleague Tim Brody is quite right that
-- insofar as the self-archiving branch of the open-access movement is
concerned -- the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd priority is content, content, content,
and that hence we are all spinning our wheels if we focus instead on
technical features that are putatively missing and hypothetically needed
before we can turn to content, content, content: Both Eprints and Dspace
have *all* the essential features needed for self-archiving, so that their
users can now proceed to self-archive at full speed, and any further delay
because of feature-fussing will -- I am ready to stake all of my credibility
on this -- be seen historically as having been an utter waste of time,
at a time when the real need was, in hindsight, so obviously 
and overwhelmingly content, content, content.

But we're not talking about just *any* content. Self-archiving and
open-access are not about *all* digital content. So Tim's remark about
Europe's lagging is comparing apples and oranges:

The open-access movement (BOAI http://www.soros.org/openaccess/ )
-- including both its branches, BOAI-1, self-archiving, and BOAI-2,
open-access journals -- is not about digital content in general:

    "The literature that should be freely accessible online is that which
    scholars give to the world without expectation of payment. Primarily,
    this category encompasses their peer-reviewed journal articles, but
    it also includes any unreviewed preprints that they might wish to
    put online for comment or to alert colleagues to important research
    findings." http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml

Hence in Tim's Europe/US comparison, LoC and OCLC are completely
irrelevant! They don't belong in the list. They are concerned with *all*
digital contents, not peer-reviewed research preprints and postprints
in particular.

ArXiv (http://arxiv.org) is indeed the biggest OAI-compliant
self-archiving Archive on the planet -- but it is also only *one* such
archive, the first of its kind, up since 1991, growing since then at the
same unchanging linear rate http://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions,
and consisting mainly of physics and mathematics content. Most important,
ArXiv is mirrored all over the world  -- http://arxiv.org/servers.html --
and being self-archived in by physicists and mathematicians all over
the world! Hence it can hardly be described as an example of Europe
lagging behind the US in content!

So what (if anything) is the relevant point of comparison between
Europe and the US? One possible one (though I don't think the exercise
would be terribly illuminating) would be to look at the archives in
OAIster -- http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/o/oaister/ -- with 1,089,937
records from 142 institutions -- and (1) either count the number of
records by European vs. US authors or (2) (perhaps more interestingly),
set aside the central, international archives in it, like ArXiv, and
count only the university archives: How many are European and how many
American? And how do they compare in average content-size?
(And don't forget to compare also with counts from BOAI-2: open-access
journals.)

But before drawing any conclusions from that, remember to normalize it
for the relative size of the research output of the two geographic
contenders!

Moral of the story? Leave it to the historians to calculate whether
Europe or the US happened to be leading in open acces in early 2003,
and concentrate instead on accelerating self-archiving (and open-access
in general) as soon and as much as possible, wherever you are: content,
content, content.

Amen.

Harnad's observation is interesting if the prime reason for publishing were to
share with colleagues. Unfortunately this ideal gets distorted by the myriad of
reasons to publish or even not to publish, regardless of the disciplines. And, as
an aside, the reasons can vary across disciplines, institutions and faculty. Aye,
there's the rub.

As Harnad points out, the technical achievements may not be the barrier at hand,
nor may it be entirely the problems with the publishers.

Perhaps some of the issues come to light when one reads the article, Taking on
Rational Man, which appeared in the January 24th issue of The Chronicle of Higher
Education where the battle lines are drawn between neoclassical economists and
heterodox thinking- and who controls the publishing resources.

Self-archiving is only for what an author elects to publish, not for
what he elects to conceal. And the motivation for publishing research is
not to "share" but to maximise the impact of one's research findings
http://www.eprints.org/self-faq/#institution-facilitate-filling
because, among other things, their impact helps pay one's salary and
fund one's future research, in this publish-or-perish world:

It is not at all a problem with publishers. It is simply taking the
research community a long time to get its head around the fact that in
the online age removing the obsolete barriers to the impact of their own
research is entirely in their own hands. They need merely go ahead and
do it, by self-archiving their own research, pre- and post-peer-review:

It has nothing -- repeat, nothing -- to do with either publishers or
economists: It is purely between the research community and itself. The
only "3rd party" involved is whoever implements the peer review
and certifies its outcome
http://www.nature.com/nature/webmatters/invisible/invisible.html
That essential service is currently funded out of journal
publishers' sales revenue, paid by institutions, but it can easily
be funded out of the windfall institutional savings -- if and when
self-archiving ever dries up the demand for journal publishers' other
products http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/resolution.htm#4.2 
But until/unless that ever happens, researchers' only concern should be
maximising the impact of their research by self-archiving it, today.

Hi Steve

I think we are in agreement here.

Perhaps one of the issues is that the open archives concept also exposes all of
these millions of refereed articles to the public at large. Academics might find
that the "Sokal Affair" was benign compared to a potential fire storm in a time
of shrinking public support for post secondary education.

What indeed would happen if the weight of decisions on promotion/tenure and pay
were shifted towards teaching and measures of student satisfaction rather than
peer review?  Or articles that did not meet standards in one or more
publications appear vetted by another source- what then?

In essence, while OAI opens research for sharing, its potential to cause
restructuring within The Academy is more than idle speculation or an
intellectual exercise

Open access does provide access to the general public too, but neither
that -- nor the library serials crisis, nor the access-problems of the
developing world, nor teacher/student needs or usage -- are the primary
factors that will persuade researchers to self-archive their work. For
researchers the direct and decisive reason will be maximixing their
own research impact.

These (in my view incorrect and irrelevant) speculations have been much
discussed in the pages of the American Scientist Forum:

http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/2523.html
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/2340.html
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/0479.html

In brief, the question of the relative weight to give teaching and
research in promotion is irrelevant to the question of open access.
The importance of peer review to research quality is also not at issue: we
are concerned with open access to the current (and currently inaccessible)
peer-reviewed literature, such as it is, not access to some hypothetical
future alternative. And competent peer-reviewers are already a scarce
enough resource today so that speculations about multiple submissions
and multiple publication can only come appeal from those who haven't a
clear idea of what the realistic options are. (The same is true about the
commendable notion that everyone should have a round-the-clock personal
tutor, and physician.)

> In essence, while OAI opens research for sharing, its potential to cause

But speculating about it now risks delaying open access still further. The
facts are enough: Open access to the peer-reviewed research literature,
such as it is, is highly desirable because it increases the potential
research impact of that literature. All other benefits are secondary. And
nothing more is at issue than access to that literature, which is not
contingent, conditional upon, or predictive of, any other speculative
outcome: just open access itself.

Hello -
=20
I am currently exploring our institution's ability to create an
institutional repository that is OAI compliant.  I feel I have a fair
understanding of the standards, functionality, etc. involved - and am
leaning toward DSpace as a model - but there is one aspect that I don't
see discussed very much...  system architecture!
=20
I would be grateful if folks would share with me some architecture
configurations they have developed.  I am most interested in the storage
aspect.  I have looked at jukebox technology as a storage backend, but
am not sure about the retrieval aspect.  We also have a super computer
with lots of storage capacity - but it is not designed to handle small
files, but rather large datasets.  Any information you would like to
share will be most appreciated.
=20
Feel free to respond directly to me if you would rather not post to the
list.
=20
Kind regards,
Amy

Amy

I would encourage people to reply to the list, it is always educational to
see how other "did it good", as it were.

Given the cheapness of storage these days, I am not sure I would recommend a
jukebox set up, unless you really have vast amounts of data. You can now fit
close to a terabyte of storage in a standard tower PC using commodity disk
drives, ATA controllers, with Linux as your operating system. You can serve
that storage to other servers using NFS for example. If you are worried
about redundancy, you can always use RAID controllers. I know there have
been a number of articles about this on Slashdot and would be happy to dig
them out and post references to them here, if there is interest.

As an example, The Internet Archive, uses commodity PCs for all its storage,
you can check it out at:

Cheers

Francois

Amy,
 
DSpace is a wonderful product, but OAI-compliance is a very small part of
what DSpace is about. If you merely want to add OAI capability to a system
that already exists, DSpace would be overkill and would probably make your
job much harder. Because DSpace is an fairly elaborate system, using it as a
model for your own architecture probably wouldn't be appropriate either.
 
OAI-compliance can most easily be achieved by downloading one of the OAI
implementations found on http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html
<http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html> . This page is a little
misleading, though, because many of the tools listed are much more than mere
implementations of the OAI protocol (e.g. DSpace).
 
I'm only familiar with two of the implementations that are available. If
you're most comfortable working in Perl, the VTOAI OAI-PMH2 PERL
implementation.seems to be popular
(http://www.dlib.vt.edu/projects/OAI/software/vtoai/vtoai.html
<http://www.dlib.vt.edu/projects/OAI/software/vtoai/vtoai.html> .) If you're
most comfortable using Java, I would suggest OAICat (
http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.shtm
<http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.shtm> ) which runs under a
J2EE-compliant servlet engine (such as Apache's Tomcat). I am the author of
the OAICat and would be glad to help you get it set up for your needs. BTW,
DSpace uses the OAICat implementation to provide its OAI repository
functionality.
 
OAICat can be customized to work with any database engine that supports a
Java API. Implementations are available for JDBC as well as a simple
file-based system. Other databases can be accommodated by implementing a set
of abstract Java classes. Implementations are also available for Newton and
the open-source Pears database engines which are used in OCLC's SiteSearch
product.
 
BTW, if you have an unusually large repository (or even if you don't) you
may even want to consider using the open-source Pears database (
http://www.oclc.org/research/software/pears/
<http://www.oclc.org/research/software/pears/> ). I use it for our XTCat
repository ( http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/ <http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/> )
which contains over 4.2 million records.
 
Hope this helps.
 
Jeff

Hello,

There is some reasonably detailed (but not fully complete) DSpace architecture documentation available from the dspace.org Web site:

http://dspace.org/technology/system-docs/index.html

This is a more recent version of the documentation available from DSpace's SourceForge page, which includes a draft architecture section.

We'll be posting a more complete version soon, both to dspace.org and to the SourceForge page.

Please feel free to ask me any specific questions you have that aren't answered by this document.

Hello -
 
I am currently exploring our institution's ability to create an institutional repository that is OAI compliant.  I feel I have a fair understanding of the standards, functionality, etc. involved - and am leaning toward DSpace as a model - but there is one aspect that I don't see discussed very much...  system architecture!
 
I would be grateful if folks would share with me some architecture configurations they have developed.  I am most interested in the storage aspect.  I have looked at jukebox technology as a storage backend, but am not sure about the retrieval aspect.  We also have a super computer with lots of storage capacity - but it is not designed to handle small files, but rather large datasets.  Any information you would like to share will be most appreciated.
 
Feel free to respond directly to me if you would rather not post to the list.
 
Kind regards,

IMS is a global consortium that develops open specifications to support
the delivery of e-learning through Learning Management Systems (LMS).

People might like to note that version 1.0 of the IMS Digital Repositories
Specification is available at

 http://www.imsglobal.org/digitalrepositories

It recommends use of the OAI-PMH for harvesting IMS metadata records
between cooperating elearning systems (e.g. from a learning object
repository to a learning management system).

The following article

 Exposing information resources for e-learning - Harvesting and searching
 IMS metadata using the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting and Z39.50
 by Steve Richardson and Andy Powell
 Ariadne issue 34
 http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue34/powell/

describes some implementation experience of using the OAI-PMH to exchange
IMS metadata.

Stephen,
 
Make sure you are clear about the difference between OAI data providers
(e.g. XTCat) and OAI service providers (e.g.
http://rocky.dlib.vt.edu/~etdunion/cgi-bin/index.pl
<http://rocky.dlib.vt.edu/~etdunion/cgi-bin/index.pl> .) The OAI-PMH, per
se, does not address the question of generalized searching. The forms
provided on the XTCat page ( http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/
<http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/> ) are there merely to exercise the OAI
protocol. They are not intended to be a general search mechanism. That's the
job of the OAI service providers.

I am writing an article for The Technology Source on OAI. It would be useful
for me if I could find some instances of good implementations. The sort of
thing I would find most useful is the sort of thing that would be
appreciated by a more general audience. For example, while XTCat is a very
nice implementation, there doesn't seem to be any way to search for records.
Also, the casual visitor is going to have no idea what to out into the
'indentifier' field, say.
 
You can preview the article here - it's in draft form so please don't
circulate this too widely just yet.
http://ts.mivu.org/default.asp?show=article
<http://ts.mivu.org/default.asp?show=article&id=2005> &id=2005
 
Any examples would be most appreciated. Additionally, any suggestions from
the OAI community would greatly enhance the usefulness and accuracy of this
article. It will be published May 1, 2003.

Amy,
 
DSpace is a wonderful product, but OAI-compliance is a very small part of
what DSpace is about. If you merely want to add OAI capability to a system
that already exists, DSpace would be overkill and would probably make your
job much harder. Because DSpace is an fairly elaborate system, using it as a
model for your own architecture probably wouldn't be appropriate either.
 
OAI-compliance can most easily be achieved by downloading one of the OAI
implementations found on http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html
<http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html> . This page is a little
misleading, though, because many of the tools listed are much more than mere
implementations of the OAI protocol (e.g. DSpace).
 
I'm only familiar with two of the implementations that are available. If
you're most comfortable working in Perl, the VTOAI OAI-PMH2 PERL
implementation.seems to be popular
(http://www.dlib.vt.edu/projects/OAI/software/vtoai/vtoai.html
<http://www.dlib.vt.edu/projects/OAI/software/vtoai/vtoai.html> .) If you're
most comfortable using Java, I would suggest OAICat (
http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.shtm
<http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.shtm> ) which runs under a
J2EE-compliant servlet engine (such as Apache's Tomcat). I am the author of
the OAICat and would be glad to help you get it set up for your needs. BTW,
DSpace uses the OAICat implementation to provide its OAI repository
functionality.
 
OAICat can be customized to work with any database engine that supports a
Java API. Implementations are available for JDBC as well as a simple
file-based system. Other databases can be accommodated by implementing a set
of abstract Java classes. Implementations are also available for Newton and
the open-source Pears database engines which are used in OCLC's SiteSearch
product.
 
BTW, if you have an unusually large repository (or even if you don't) you
may even want to consider using the open-source Pears database (
http://www.oclc.org/research/software/pears/
<http://www.oclc.org/research/software/pears/> ). I use it for our XTCat
repository ( http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/ <http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/> )
which contains over 4.2 million records.
 
Hope this helps.

Hello -
 
I am currently exploring our institution's ability to create an
institutional repository that is OAI compliant.  I feel I have a fair
understanding of the standards, functionality, etc. involved - and am
leaning toward DSpace as a model - but there is one aspect that I don't see
discussed very much...  system architecture!
 
I would be grateful if folks would share with me some architecture
configurations they have developed.  I am most interested in the storage
aspect.  I have looked at jukebox technology as a storage backend, but am
not sure about the retrieval aspect.  We also have a super computer with
lots of storage capacity - but it is not designed to handle small files, but
rather large datasets.  Any information you would like to share will be most
appreciated.
 
Feel free to respond directly to me if you would rather not post to the
list.
 
Kind regards,
Amy

Here's an idea for a simple service provider implementation.
 
Having harvested and aggregated from a number of OAI data providers into a
database, it should be fairly easy to implement an SRW/SRU service (
http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/srw/
<http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/srw/> ) to search/retrieve the data.
This would give you the power of Z39.50 with a simple HTTP GET or SOAP
interface rather than the troublesome traditional Z39.50 interface. The user
interface would amount to nothing more than HTML forms with the SRU server
as the action target. The responses would come back in XML (SOAP in the case
of SRW). It would be possible, though, to include an XSL stylesheet in the
response so that it can be rendered as HTML in a browser.
 
Here's an example (but which lacks an XSL stylesheet):
http://alcme.oclc.org/axis/SOAR/services/SearchRetrieveService?query=educati
on
<http://alcme.oclc.org/axis/SOAR/services/SearchRetrieveService?query=educat
ion&maximumRecords=1> &maximumRecords=1 
 
This solution would give you not only a simple HTML form-based user
interface, but also a web service interface that other services could
incorporate.
 
Just a thought.
 
Jeff

I am writing an article for The Technology Source on OAI. It would be useful
for me if I could find some instances of good implementations. The sort of
thing I would find most useful is the sort of thing that would be
appreciated by a more general audience. For example, while XTCat is a very
nice implementation, there doesn't seem to be any way to search for records.
Also, the casual visitor is going to have no idea what to out into the
'indentifier' field, say.
 
You can preview the article here - it's in draft form so please don't
circulate this too widely just yet.
http://ts.mivu.org/default.asp?show=article
<http://ts.mivu.org/default.asp?show=article&id=2005> &id=2005
 
Any examples would be most appreciated. Additionally, any suggestions from
the OAI community would greatly enhance the usefulness and accuracy of this
article. It will be published May 1, 2003.

Amy,
 
DSpace is a wonderful product, but OAI-compliance is a very small part of
what DSpace is about. If you merely want to add OAI capability to a system
that already exists, DSpace would be overkill and would probably make your
job much harder. Because DSpace is an fairly elaborate system, using it as a
model for your own architecture probably wouldn't be appropriate either.
 
OAI-compliance can most easily be achieved by downloading one of the OAI
implementations found on http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html
<http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html> . This page is a little
misleading, though, because many of the tools listed are much more than mere
implementations of the OAI protocol (e.g. DSpace).
 
I'm only familiar with two of the implementations that are available. If
you're most comfortable working in Perl, the VTOAI OAI-PMH2 PERL
implementation.seems to be popular
(http://www.dlib.vt.edu/projects/OAI/software/vtoai/vtoai.html
<http://www.dlib.vt.edu/projects/OAI/software/vtoai/vtoai.html> .) If you're
most comfortable using Java, I would suggest OAICat (
http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.shtm
<http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.shtm> ) which runs under a
J2EE-compliant servlet engine (such as Apache's Tomcat). I am the author of
the OAICat and would be glad to help you get it set up for your needs. BTW,
DSpace uses the OAICat implementation to provide its OAI repository
functionality.
 
OAICat can be customized to work with any database engine that supports a
Java API. Implementations are available for JDBC as well as a simple
file-based system. Other databases can be accommodated by implementing a set
of abstract Java classes. Implementations are also available for Newton and
the open-source Pears database engines which are used in OCLC's SiteSearch
product.
 
BTW, if you have an unusually large repository (or even if you don't) you
may even want to consider using the open-source Pears database (
http://www.oclc.org/research/software/pears/
<http://www.oclc.org/research/software/pears/> ). I use it for our XTCat
repository ( http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/ <http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/> )
which contains over 4.2 million records.
 
Hope this helps.
 
Jeff

Subject: [OAI-general] System Architecture


Hello -
 
I am currently exploring our institution's ability to create an
institutional repository that is OAI compliant.  I feel I have a fair
understanding of the standards, functionality, etc. involved - and am
leaning toward DSpace as a model - but there is one aspect that I don't see
discussed very much...  system architecture!
 
I would be grateful if folks would share with me some architecture
configurations they have developed.  I am most interested in the storage
aspect.  I have looked at jukebox technology as a storage backend, but am
not sure about the retrieval aspect.  We also have a super computer with
lots of storage capacity - but it is not designed to handle small files, but
rather large datasets.  Any information you would like to share will be most
appreciated.
 
Feel free to respond directly to me if you would rather not post to the
list.
 
Kind regards,
Amy

Hi

As requested here are two articles on Slashdot about this. For some reason
the article pointed to by the first discussion is dead and the article
pointed to by the last discussion is password protected, but there are of
interesting comments from people, including information about the gear they
used to build their own terabyte servers:

Cheers

Hello,

On Feb. 6, Tim Brody claimed on this list that DSpace wasn't OAI compliant based on harvesting attempts he'd made (see
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-general/2003-February/000239.html), suggesting that DSpace allowed
XML-illegal characters where the harvesters expected legal ones.

So, I guess my naive question is... Is DSpace OAI compliant or not?

Mark

Hello,

There is currently a minor problem with OAI support on MIT's instance of DSpace.  For some reason, various unicode characters are either malformed in the data or being incorrectly encoded in DSpace's responses to OAI requests.  Basically it's just a minor bug somewhere that we are currently hunting down (it's a high priority).  It should be fixed within a week or two.

Mark,

DSpace uses our OAICat implementation to enable OAI access to the DSpace
database. There are a couple of possibilities here.

The first is that the data as it exists in the DSpace database contains bad
characters. If that's the case, there's nothing OAICat can (or at least
should) do to correct the situation. Basically it's garbage in, garbage out
at that point.

The second possibility is related to the fact that OAICat is a framework
that can be customized to work with any database that supports a Java API.
This is done by implementing some abstract Java interfaces to the search
engine of one's choice. This was the case with DSpace, where Robert Tansley
wrote some code to interface with JDBC. It's possible that something is
amiss within this custom code.

I don't believe that the problem is in the OAICat framework itself because I
have a couple of OAICat repositories that produce proper Unicode results.

Unicode is such a pain.

Jeff

Hi

I cant speak to the legality of their XML. What I have found is that they
put the author in the 'contributor' field as opposed to the 'creator' field
which is where everyone else put it. I am not sure if that would be termed
non-compliant, but it is did throw my indexer for a loop.

Seems that we are all talking about compliance versus no-compliance right
now :)

Cheers

Francois

I agree that there do seem to be a few small problems with DSpace at MITs
current output at present (see my post to oai-implementers in a few
minutes if you want details). However, the key point is that DSpace is
designed (as is Eprints.org) to export metadata via OAI-PMH. Subject to
the encoding issue, harvesting seems to work fine. I just harvested all 
752 DC metadata records by telling my harvested the baseURL.

Cheers,
Simeon.

I am writing an article for The Technology Source on OAI. It would be useful
for me if I could find some instances of good implementations. The sort of
thing I would find most useful is the sort of thing that would be
appreciated by a more general audience. For example, while XTCat is a very
nice implementation, there doesn't seem to be any way to search for records.
Also, the casual visitor is going to have no idea what to out into the
'indentifier' field, say.
 
You can preview the article here - it's in draft form so please don't
circulate this too widely just yet.
http://ts.mivu.org/default.asp?show=article
<http://ts.mivu.org/default.asp?show=article&id=2005> &id=2005
 
Any examples would be most appreciated. Additionally, any suggestions from
the OAI community would greatly enhance the usefulness and accuracy of this
article. It will be published May 1, 2003.

Amy,
 
DSpace is a wonderful product, but OAI-compliance is a very small part of
what DSpace is about. If you merely want to add OAI capability to a system
that already exists, DSpace would be overkill and would probably make your
job much harder. Because DSpace is an fairly elaborate system, using it as a
model for your own architecture probably wouldn't be appropriate either.
 
OAI-compliance can most easily be achieved by downloading one of the OAI
implementations found on http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html
<http://www.openarchives.org/tools/tools.html> . This page is a little
misleading, though, because many of the tools listed are much more than mere
implementations of the OAI protocol (e.g. DSpace).
 
I'm only familiar with two of the implementations that are available. If
you're most comfortable working in Perl, the VTOAI OAI-PMH2 PERL
implementation.seems to be popular
(http://www.dlib.vt.edu/projects/OAI/software/vtoai/vtoai.html
<http://www.dlib.vt.edu/projects/OAI/software/vtoai/vtoai.html> .) If you're
most comfortable using Java, I would suggest OAICat (
http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.shtm
<http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.shtm> ) which runs under a
J2EE-compliant servlet engine (such as Apache's Tomcat). I am the author of
the OAICat and would be glad to help you get it set up for your needs. BTW,
DSpace uses the OAICat implementation to provide its OAI repository
functionality.
 
OAICat can be customized to work with any database engine that supports a
Java API. Implementations are available for JDBC as well as a simple
file-based system. Other databases can be accommodated by implementing a set
of abstract Java classes. Implementations are also available for Newton and
the open-source Pears database engines which are used in OCLC's SiteSearch
product.
 
BTW, if you have an unusually large repository (or even if you don't) you
may even want to consider using the open-source Pears database (
http://www.oclc.org/research/software/pears/
<http://www.oclc.org/research/software/pears/> ). I use it for our XTCat
repository ( http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/ <http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/> )
which contains over 4.2 million records.
 
Hope this helps.
 
Jeff

Hello -
 
I am currently exploring our institution's ability to create an
institutional repository that is OAI compliant.  I feel I have a fair
understanding of the standards, functionality, etc. involved - and am
leaning toward DSpace as a model - but there is one aspect that I don't see
discussed very much...  system architecture!
 
I would be grateful if folks would share with me some architecture
configurations they have developed.  I am most interested in the storage
aspect.  I have looked at jukebox technology as a storage backend, but am
not sure about the retrieval aspect.  We also have a super computer with
lots of storage capacity - but it is not designed to handle small files, but
rather large datasets.  Any information you would like to share will be most
appreciated.
 
Feel free to respond directly to me if you would rather not post to the
list.
 
Kind regards,
Amy

Subject: RE: [OAI-general] System Architecture


Stephen,
 
Make sure you are clear about the difference between OAI data providers
(e.g. XTCat) and OAI service providers (e.g.
http://rocky.dlib.vt.edu/~etdunion/cgi-bin/index.pl
<http://rocky.dlib.vt.edu/~etdunion/cgi-bin/index.pl> .) The OAI-PMH, per
se, does not address the question of generalized searching. The forms
provided on the XTCat page ( http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/
<http://alcme.oclc.org/xtcat/> ) are there merely to exercise the OAI
protocol. They are not intended to be a general search mechanism. That's the
job of the OAI service providers.
I recognize that. Some URLs of OAI service providers would be useful to me.
 
While I'm writing, I would like to ask also whether there have been any
implementations of OAI for learning object metadata (such as IMS, IEEE_LOM,
CanCore, etc). The OAI harvesting model is an excellent means of harvesting
learning object meatada for search & use by individuals or learning
management systems. If implementations exist, it would be exceptionally
useful to me.

A fairly complete list of OAI service providers can be found at:
http://www.openarchives.org/service/listproviders.html

I am also very interested in hearing about learning object oriented  
implementations of OAI. It seems like a natural extension of OAI  
service providers.

Kat,

The Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) uses OAI to share a
specialized IMS-based metadata called DLESE-IMS. You can find specific
information about this framework at:  
http://www.dlese.org/Metadata/categories/framework.htm. As that page
mentions we are in the process of updating our systems to use a new
IMS-inspired learning object metadata framework called ADN.

You can get general information about DLESE and conduct a search over our 
collection at http://www.dlese.org/

The Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) uses OAI to share
a
specialized IMS-based metadata called DLESE-IMS. You can find specific
information about this framework at:  
http://www.dlese.org/Metadata/categories/framework.htm. As that page
mentions we are in the process of updating our systems to use a new
IMS-inspired learning object metadata framework called ADN.

You can get general information about DLESE and conduct a search over
our 
collection at http://www.dlese.org/

Of course, the basic OAI schema for DC is unqualified, so the qualifiers Margret mentions are unknown to harvesters.

My own tuppence' worth... I've always wondered why there's one element in DC (creator) that's arguably a subset of/subsumed by another (contributor).  Additionally, when talking about digital objects, the 'creator' (whomever is 'primarily responsible' for creation) is often debatable:  Consider a work originally written by a professor, that is scanned in and deposited by one of his students.  Is the professor 'primarily responsible' for the work?  If one considers the bits and bytes of the digitised manifestation, one could argue it's the student that is primarily responsible for their creation.  Or are they both creators?  That could cause confusion too.  It seems there's an implicit assumption that 'creator' corresponds to original authors, the professor in this case.

I'm sure I'm not the first person to think along these lines (the Library Application Profile folk obviously thought about this), so I'd be interested to hear what folk more directly involved in DC think.

In other news, we've tracked down the encoding problem--we had some bad data in the database that was introduced by a bug in a batch import script.  It'll be cleaned up on the production server soon, I'll let you know when that happens.

In the various search systems we have developed based on OAI harvested DC 
records, we have always combined the creator and contributor (and I think 
even the publisher?) fields together under a single index, primarily because 
of the issues described in this discussion thread.

In our Cultural Heritage search service 
(http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/CandI303/search/) the combined index is 
labeled 'Author/Artist'.  In our engineering search interface 
(http://g118.grainger.uiuc.edu/engroai/) the combined index is labeled 
'Author/Editor'.

When aggregating across many different OAI providers especially across 
disciplines, this seems to be the only way to do it.  If the experts can't 
agree on how to split this data, the average (non-expert) user probably 
isn't going to understand the difference either, or probably even care.

Subject: [OAI-general] Problem with customisation of eprints software
Message-ID: <3E5C0A82.9D5E5306@lib.monash.edu.au>

Hi all. 

I'm trying to customise the eprints software (we're using
EPrints 2.1.1 - from software.eprints.org.

I've edited the template file "template-en.xml" but because I'm not very
knowledgeable of the XML schema they are using and how it's set up, I'm
having problems.

I've input some standard HTML in the XML file and it's rejecting it,
even though it is OK HTML coding.
It says I have mismatched <a> and </a> tags when I run the
"generate_static" script.

It doesn't like the fact that I've opened the hypertext link with:

  <a href=.....something here....> 

and then I've put in an IMAGE in the next part:

  <img src=".... image file.....>

and then closed with </a>

The full HTML is below (excuse the email wrap-around):

    <td colspan="3"><a href="#content">
     <img src="http://www.monash.edu.au/assets/spacer.gif" width="1" 
         height="1" border="0" alt="Skip to content"></a></td>


Anyone got any ideas out there?
How did you customise your eprints software?
Did you customise the following files, or have I got it wrong:

 index.xpage
 template-en.xml
 information.xpage
 vlit.xpage

Regards,

Simon

Message-ID: <0A5DF42D7014D411A58900D0B73E92AE06DA1117@exch1.rhul.ac.uk>

Does anyone know of any existing tools to help with the manipulation and/or
display of the oai_marc format? I'm using our Aleph library system to return
a set of records in oai_marc, and I want to do some sorting (including the
use of non-filing indicators) and then do a 'nice' display for access in a
web browser.

If you have anything that might help, or give me a starting point, it would
be great.

	Dear Stephens,

	At CERN, we also use Aleph library system (v500) and we transfer
all the bibliographic information in Marc21 to the CDSware
(http://cdsware.cern.ch) software which takes care of the oai_marc
manipulation, sorting, etc.
	Try to run a search from <http://cdsweb.cern.ch> and look at the
different output formats and sorting options.

	With best regards,
