<PRE>I'm considering adding version control to the files. This is going to be
needed for the oft discussed j-prints (eprints with peer review)

I think for archives like ECS letting the author un-deposit then resubmit is
probably OK, but bad for cogprints. I'm considering adding it as an *option*
which the archive admin can enable/disable.

This is definitely a quality vs. quantity issue. ECS EPrints is already such
a state I don't think it can hurt. Cogprints is another matter.

Suggestions of a perfect(better) solution are more than welcome.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mark suggested that an archived article should be a persisting object,
</I>&gt;<i> with a persisting identifier. That seems reasonable. Now if there have
</I>&gt;<i> been several successive versions of a paper (which the author wants to
</I>&gt;<i> consider as successive versions rather than new papers), then it also
</I>&gt;<i> seems reasonable that the archive should link all the successive
</I>&gt;<i> versions and point to the latest one by default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All the prior versions are preserved, and accessible (unless the archive
</I>&gt;<i> has a policy allowing withdrawal -- a policy that should not be
</I>&gt;<i> encouraged).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is the user's or citer's responsibility to specify which version they
</I>&gt;<i> have used/cited, if there are more than one. That will become part of
</I>&gt;<i> good scholarship, just as spelling the author's name correctly is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So we need both unique identifier for a generic paper and a unique
</I>&gt;<i> identifier for a specific draft of that paper.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is particularly likely when the matter being discussed is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; controversial. A citation strictly refers to a manifestation/version 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not the generic paper. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correct. It refers to a specific draft, usually with a calendar date and
</I>&gt;<i> some other identifying features.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the person making the citation wishes to change the citation to a later 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version then that is *their* right. The link is *their* link, not the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; target's. If you have 'published' something then it is in the public domain 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and you must expect people to cite it (and that version).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I mostly agree. But this seems to be covered by providing unique version
</I>&gt;<i> identifies; it does not prevent the Archive from defaulting to the most
</I>&gt;<i> recent version -- while offering the earlier versions too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It might be making a subtle difference in the view people are taking on
</I>&gt;<i> this whether they are thinking of the Archive as a centralized one
</I>&gt;<i> (rather like a journal) or a distributed institutional one (rather like
</I>&gt;<i> author-provided reprints). It is conceivable that different drafts of a
</I>&gt;<i> paper will be in different archives. Those distributed versions too,
</I>&gt;<i> need to be trackable and integrated. My technical inexpertise leaves me
</I>&gt;<i> unable to propose how to do this, but it is the hardest-case scenario,
</I>&gt;<i> and the one we should aim to cover, eventually. Assuming it will all
</I>&gt;<i> be in one central archive is probably unrealistic (and unnecessary, in the
</I>&gt;<i> spirit of distributed OAI archiving and interoperability).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To my layman's ear it sounds as if every version of a paper will need a
</I>&gt;<i> unique version identifier, and in addition, there will need to be some
</I>&gt;<i> interoperable ways of integrating different versions as being different
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the same paper. The new scholarship will be, at the gross
</I>&gt;<i> level, concerned only with citing the generic paper (without worrying
</I>&gt;<i> about version fine-tuning), but the careful scholars need to have the
</I>&gt;<i> option of specifying the version too, uniquely, for those cases where
</I>&gt;<i> it matters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree that archive items should persist and, therefore, the references to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them. The relationship between the versions should be issue to click 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regards the 'user' query, they need to be told not to submit so many 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; versions i.e. *think* carefully before submission! This is a matter of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; policy and governs the degree of 'resistance' there is to making 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; submissions. There needs to be some otherwise the quality level drop.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It cuts both ways. Yes, authors should not start archiving willy-nilly
</I>&gt;<i> every raw draft and every afterthought. But they should not feel
</I>&gt;<i> constrained in doing corrections and updates whenever they are needed
</I>&gt;<i> too. Authors should know, though, that from the moment they place a draft
</I>&gt;<i> into a public open-access archive, it may be read, cited, and pointed to
</I>&gt;<i> -- that specific draft -- in perpetuum. That is part of what it means
</I>&gt;<i> to have archived something publicly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure scholars will easily get a sense for this, as they have for
</I>&gt;<i> everything else. In the beginning some will fumble and treat the
</I>&gt;<i> archive as labile first drafts or lapidary touch-me-nots, but experience
</I>&gt;<i> and feedback will calibrate everyone's practice and reflexes. The
</I>&gt;<i> Archives just have to make sure they do not pre-judge or short-circuit
</I>&gt;<i> any important options a priori.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explained the rationale for not having designed the archive so a paper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be deposited, and then modified willy-nilly under the same URL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For that would not have been an archive at all, and user complaints,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drafts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, that is one way to look at it. On the other hand, arXiv.org uses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; version numbers and the persistent name/id and URL (say hep-th/0210311
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; and <A HREF="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-th/0210311">http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-th/0210311</A>) always points to the latest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; with links to the earlier versions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe you are advocating a poor design choice here. One cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; overemphasize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the importance of human-friendly persistent names that are easily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; converted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; to URL's for linking and quick location. Patching the system to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; redirect to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; latest linked version is a hack. Is one actually able to download
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the earlier version (which is what was cited)? Generally, a better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; approach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; is to give a good persistent name to a &quot;work&quot; and not a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; manifestation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; of that work (whether it be a particular format or a particular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; version) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; then give a reader a single point of entry into the system that can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; bookmarked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; or cited reliably which gives a choice of what to download. Cutting off
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; access
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; to an earlier, citeable version is a mistake. Archives should not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; delete items
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; or make them hard to access - rather they should show items in context
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; and give easy access to an item's history and versioning with a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; identifier for the work taken as a whole.
