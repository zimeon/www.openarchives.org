Call for articles:  Special issue of Library Hi Tech titled:

MARC and Metadata:  Future Developments and Relationships

This is a call for articles for a special issue of Library Hi Tech devoted
to the topic of MARC and metadata standards/initiatives that are attempting
to enhance, exploit, emulate, and/or replace the MARC standard.  This
special issue is especially interested in examining current developments
with MODS, METS, XML MARC, and OAI in these areas, and the issue editor is
looking for experts, developers, and users of these standards to write
articles for the issue.

The deadline for receipt of final articles would be June 31, 2003, and the
issue would probably be published in late 2003/early 2004.  If you are
interested in writing an article, please send a proposal with a title and
short abstract of the content of the article, as well as some information
regarding your expertise and experience with the standard(s) that you plan
to discuss.  Co-authored articles are also encouraged.  If you have any
questions, please contact the special issue editor at:

Brad Eden, Ph.D.
Head, Bibliographic and Metadata Services
University of Nevada, Las Vegas
<A HREF="mailto:beden@ccmail.nevada.edu">beden@ccmail.nevada.edu</A>

Deadline for receipt of proposals is January 31, 2003.
