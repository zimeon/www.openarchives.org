<PRE>I agree completely with Mark Doyle and was not (in my reply to a query
from a user) venturing to suggest policy. I was trying to explain to
the user why one could not keep updating the same archived paper
(whether metadata or text). I leave it to Mark, Chris and the experts
to pick the optimal technical solution. (Chris?)

</I>&gt;<i> Well, that is one way to look at it. On the other hand, arXiv.org uses
</I>&gt;<i> version numbers and the persistent name/id and URL (say hep-th/0210311
</I>&gt;<i> and <A HREF="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-th/0210311">http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-th/0210311</A>) always points to the latest
</I>&gt;<i> version
</I>&gt;<i> with links to the earlier versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe you are advocating a poor design choice here. One cannot
</I>&gt;<i> overemphasize
</I>&gt;<i> the importance of human-friendly persistent names that are easily
</I>&gt;<i> converted
</I>&gt;<i> to URL's for linking and quick location. Patching the system to
</I>&gt;<i> redirect to the
</I>&gt;<i> latest linked version is a hack. Is one actually able to download
</I>&gt;<i> the earlier version (which is what was cited)? Generally, a better
</I>&gt;<i> approach
</I>&gt;<i> is to give a good persistent name to a &quot;work&quot; and not a single
</I>&gt;<i> manifestation
</I>&gt;<i> of that work (whether it be a particular format or a particular
</I>&gt;<i> version) and
</I>&gt;<i> then give a reader a single point of entry into the system that can be
</I>&gt;<i> bookmarked
</I>&gt;<i> or cited reliably which gives a choice of what to download. Cutting off
</I>&gt;<i> access
</I>&gt;<i> to an earlier, citeable version is a mistake. Archives should not
</I>&gt;<i> delete items
</I>&gt;<i> or make them hard to access - rather they should show items in context
</I>&gt;<i> and give easy access to an item's history and versioning with a single
</I>&gt;<i> identifier for the work taken as a whole.
