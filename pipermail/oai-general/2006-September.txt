First Call for Papers
11th International Conference on Electronic Publishing
13 to 15 June 2007, Vienna (Austria)

http://www.elpub.net

Openness in Digital Publishing: Awareness, Discovery and Access
 
"Openness" is a broad philosophical as well as technical tenet that
underlies much of the innovation in the creation and consumption of Internet
technologies, which are in turn transforming scholarly communications,
practices and publishing across the disciplines and around the world.
 
ELPUB 2007 is devoted to examining the full spectrum of "openness" in
digital publishing, from open source applications for content creation to
open distribution of content, and open standards to facilitate sharing and
open access. We welcome papers with theoretical analysis, description of
models and services, or new and innovative technical results on:

* Publishing models, tools, services and roles
* Digital publication value chain
* Multilingual and multimodal interfaces
* Services and technology for specific user communities, media, and content
* Interoperability and scalability
* Middleware infrastructure to facilitate awareness and discovery
* Personalisation technologies (e.g. social tagging, folksonomies, RSS,
  microformats)
* Metadata creation, usage and interoperability
* Semantic web issues
* Security, privacy and copyright issues
* Digital reservation, contents authentication
* Recommendations, guidelines, standards
 
AUTHOR GUIDELINES:
Contributions are invited for the following categories:

- Single papers (abstract minimum of 1,000 and maximum of 1500 words)
- Tutorial (abstract minimum of 500 and maximum of 1500 words)
- Workshop (abstract max of 1000 words)
- Poster (abstract max of 500 words)
- Demonstration (abstract max of 500 words)
 
Abstracts must be submitted following the instructions on the conference
website <http://www.elpub.net>.
 
Important dates:

January 10th 2007: Deadline for submission of abstracts (in all categories):
           
February 28, 2007: Authors will be notified of the acceptance of submitted
papers and workshop proposal.
 
April 11th, 2007: Final papers must be received . See website for detailed
author instructions.
 
Posters (A1-format) and demonstration materials should be brought by their
authors at the conference time. Only abstracts of these contributions will
be published in the conference proceedings. Information on requirements for
Workshops and tutorials proposals will be posted shortly on the website.
 
Accepted full paper will be published in the conference proceedings.
Electronic version of the contributions will also be archived at:
http://elpub.scix.net <http://elpub.scix.net/
 
ABOUT ELPUB
 
The ELPUB 2007 conference will keep the tradition of the ten previous
international conferences on electronic publishing, held in the United
Kingdom (in 1997 and 2001), Hungary (1998), Sweden (1999), Russia (2000),
the Czech Republic (2002), Portugal (2003), Brazil (2004), Belgium (2005)
and Bulgaria (2006), which is to bring together researchers, lecturers,
librarians, developers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, managers, users and all
those interested on issues regarding electronic publishing in widely
differing contexts. These include the human, cultural, economic, social,
technological, legal, commercial and other relevant aspects that such an
exciting theme encompasses.
 
Three distinguished features of this conference are: broad scope of topics
which creates a unique atmosphere of active exchange and learning about
various aspects of electronic publishing; combination of general and
technical issues; and a condensed procedure of submission, revision and
publication of proceedings which guarantees presentations of most recent
work.
         
Conference Location:
Vienna, the capital of Austria, is one of Europe's most fascinating cities
with a rich history and various cultural attractions and reasonable livingcosts. The campus of Vienna University of Technology is located near the
historic downtown of Vienna.
 
Conference Host: Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria
 
General Chair: Bob Martens <b.martens@tuwien.ac.at>, Vienna University of
Technology, Vienna, Austria
 
Programme Chair:  Leslie Chan <chan@utsc.utoronto.ca>, University of Toronto
at Scarborough, Toronto, Canada

Subject: [OAI-general] XSLT from oai_dc to CSV
Message-ID: <4509808F.8000008@uiuc.edu>

Hi all,

Over time I've gotten several requests for comma-separated-value dumps 
from various of the OAI repositories that I manage.  In case anyone else 
might have similar needs I'm making an XSLT available that will 
transform the oai_dc XML format into a CSV file where the columns 
represent DC fields:

http://dlf.grainger.uiuc.edu/dlfcollectionsregistry/oai/oai_dc2csv.xsl

The output details are parameterized in case you prefer tab-delimited 
instead comma-delimited, for example.

Enjoy,
	Tom Habing

Open User Group meetings for DSpace, Fedora, and EPrints, followed by
general conference sessions that cover cross-cutting and overarching issues.
This year, the user groups will partition their programs into Plenary,

meetings are open to all attendees.

The general conference program will be organized around the following
themes:
     * Open access and strategic context (social and technical) for repositories
     * Value-  added services to enhance particular repositories
     * Achieving interoperability for repositories
     * Repositories and IT infrastructure
     * Open source software
     * Digital preservation
     * Use cases for repositories
     * Modeling for digital objects and repositories
     * Management and policy issues
     * Metrics

OR07 is pleased to announce the keynote speakers for the general
conference. The opening keynote for the general conference will be
given by James L. Hilton, Vice President and Chief Information Officer at
the University of Virginia. The closing keynote will be given by Tony Hey,
Corporate Vice President for Technical Computing at Microsoft.

Please see the website (www.openrepositories.org) for more details.

 	In this report is stated:
-----------------
CDSware (now recently changed to CDS Invenio) has been excluded from
the in-depth analysis for the following reasons
It has extremely complex installation steps. These steps can be seen here:
            http://cdsware.cern.ch/download/INSTALL
CDSware also does not have a good community around it. The mailing
list has had very limited traffic since 2002, which indicates that this
project may have sustainability issues going forward:

http://cdsware.cern.ch/lists/project-cdsware-users/archive/date.shtml
----------------

         These two statements about CDS Invenio are not correct. 
Understanding that the authors may have wanted to narrow the field of 
study to make the task easier, they should not have justified this using 
false statements which would misguide the community.

         About the first point, the "complex installation" instructions: 
they are mostly full and explicit details for the curious or novice 
sysadmin.  The impatient installer is simply directed to 20 lines of 
instructions in the middle.

         About the second point, the community around Invenio: the adopter 
community is growing, as is the developer community which is now wider 
that just the CERN site with formal collaboration established with EPFL 
and many other contributions world-wide. The developper listbox is very 
active but the authors of the report did not subscribe to it... The 
authors of the report also missed the 'Demo' link where quite a few sites 
using Invenio are linked to; among them are the biggest OAI data provider 
in terms of number of documents...

 	It is a pity to write such a report without taking into account 
one of the biggest and most used Open Source Repository software. At 
least, the exclusion of CDS Invenio from the study should not be justified 
by misleading arguments.

 		Jean-Yves Le Meur.

Thank-you Jean-Yves,
There has never been any intent to justify by misleading. Our motivations have been to determine the right solution for our specific project. Inherently, in these types of reports, there will be a measure of subjective observations. We will re-visit the points you raise and amend the narrative as appropriate.

 	Dear Richard,

 	Thanks for your precisions and for a possible amendment to the 
text concerning CDS Invenio.
 	Please note my remark was mostly motivated by the fact that you 
have done a good work for Eprints, DSpace and Fedora so that we at CDS 
would have liked to see Invenio evaluated in the same way.
