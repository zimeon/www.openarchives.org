Welcome to JCDL 2006

The Joint Conference on Digital Libraries is a major international forum
focusing on digital libraries and associated technical, practical, and
social issues. JCDL encompasses the many meanings of the term &quot;digital
libraries,&quot; including (but not limited to) new forms of information
institutions; operational information systems with all manner of digital
content; new means of selecting, collecting, organizing, and distributing
digital content; digital preservation and archiving; and theoretical
models of information media, including document genres and electronic
publishing.

Paper Submission

Full and short papers will be included in the conference proceedings and
will be presented at the conference. Papers must be in English with a
limit of 10 pages (approximately 5000 words) for full papers and 2 pages
for short papers. All papers must be original contributions (i.e., not
have been previously published or currently under review for publication
elsewhere). All contributions are to be submitted in electronic form via
the JCDL conference web site, following ACM format guidelines and using
the template provided. Preferred submission formats are PDF or Microsoft
Word. The conference will award the Vannevar Bush Award to the best full
paper.

Panels, Posters, and Demonstrations

Panels and posters provide opportunities to present work-in-progress,
late-breaking results, or other efforts that would benefit from discussion
with the community. Successful panel proposals should involve a
controversial or emerging topic and articulate and entertaining panelists.
Panel proposals must consist of a title, a 1-page extended abstract
explaining the topic and goals of the session along with a list of titles
of individual presentations and/or viewpoints and contact information for
the organizer, moderator, and panelists. Posters permit presentation of
late-breaking results in an informal, interactive manner. Poster proposals
should consist of a title, a 1-page extended abstract, and contact
information for the authors. Accepted posters will be displayed at the
conference and may include additional materials, space permitting.
Abstracts of panels and posters will appear in the proceedings.
Demonstrations will allow attendees to have first-hand views of innovative
digital libraries technology and applications and to talk informally with
system developers and researchers. Demonstration proposals should consist
of a title, a 1-page extended abstract, and contact information for the
authors. Abstracts of demonstrations will appear in the proceedings. All
contributions are to be submitted in electronic form via the JCDL
conference web site.

Tutorials and Workshops

Proposals for tutorials and workshops are also solicited. Tutorials are
intended to present a single topic in detail over either a half-day or a
full day. Tutorial proposals should include: a tutorial title; an abstract
(1-2 paragraphs, to be used in conference programs); a description or
topical outline of tutorial (1-2 paragraphs, to be used for evaluation);
duration (half- or full-day); expected number of participants; target
audience, including level of experience (introductory, intermediate,
advanced); learning objectives; a brief biographical sketch of the
presenter(s); and contact information for the presenter(s). Tutorial
proposals should be emailed directly to the tutorial chair. For further
information please contact the tutorial chair.

Workshops are intended to draw together communities of interest in a new
or emerging issue and provide a forum for discussion and exploration.
Submissions should include: a workshop title and short description; a
statement of objectives for the workshop; a topical outline for the
workshop; identification of the expected audience; a description of the
planned format, duration (half- or full-day), and expected number of
attendees; information about how the attendees will be identified,
notified of the workshop, and, if necessary, selected from among
applicants; as well as contact and biographical information about the
organizers. Finally, if a workshop has been held previously, information
about the earlier sessions should be provided -- dates, locations,
outcomes, attendance, etc. Workshop proposals should be emailed directly
to the workshop chair. For further information please contact the workshop
chair.
