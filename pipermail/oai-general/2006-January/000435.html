invite you to submit proposals for presentations at this meeting.
Authors may submit abstracts for one of the following presentation
formats:

-Long Presentation

The general focus of the meeting is on tools to aid embedding into
institutional systems both internal and external, and the use of DSpace
in different areas of institutional activity (for example, Records
Management). Nonetheless, any topic relevant to DSpace (both technical
and administrative) is welcomed. Abstracts should be of approximately
200 words and should be submitted by 15 February 2006 by email to

Presentation format

Long presentations will take place in the main conference hall, and
should be approximately 25 minutes in length, followed by 5 minutes for
questions and discussion. 

Short presentations will take place during break-out sessions, and
should be approximately 10 minutes in length and will act as catalysts
for the discussions which will take place in those sessions. There will
be break-out sessions on both technical and administrative issues. 

Posters will be presented during coffee breaks, and will be available in
the conference venue for the duration of the event. There will be an
allocated time for presenters to stand by their poster for discussion. 

Workshops and tutorials will be provided on both technical and
administrative aspects of DSpace, and abstracts for these should include
the topic and a guide to how the session should be run. If the workshop
or tutorial is to be interactive we can offer assistance in organising
