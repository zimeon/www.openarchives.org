Subject: [OAI-general] early institutional eprint archives
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20030118202208.02d0d5f8@pop.earlham.edu>

--=====================_207676833==_.ALT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed


I'm trying to make sure that my FOS Timeline 
<http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/timeline.htm> includes the landmark 
institutional eprint archives:  those that are very early, very influential 
or both.  For example, were there any notable institutional eprint archives 
prior to the 1999 launch of OAI?  And after the OAI launch, which were the 
early adopters?

I'm fairly confident that I have the landmark disciplinary archives, but I 
suspect there are some important institutional archives not yet on my list.

If you can help me with the names of important archives, their URLs, or 
their launch dates, I'd appreciate it.  I can look up the details that you 
might not have.

Of course I'd also welcome suggestions for other landmark events missing 
from the timeline.

      Thanks,
      Peter

Subject: [OAI-general] (Possible) Errors with OAI repositories
Message-ID: <04a001c2c237$8aa0a990$14414e98@Shrek>

(apologies for cross-post)

Hi all,

I've started harvesting OAI-PMH version 1.x repositories (so that they are
accessible to OAI 2.0 harvesters):
http://celestial.eprints.org/cgi-bin/status

If you have a repository (version 1.0, 1.1, or 2.0) and you're interested in
having it mirrored/gatewayed please email me with your baseURL.

I hope repo. admins don't mind me posting problems I've found here -
otherwise it would involve a lot of individual correspondance for fairly
common problems!

The following repositories appear to have XML character errors that prevent
parsing (according to Perl 5.8.0 XML::Parser):
217.21.43.5.ELibBSU
aim25.ac.uk
archives.anlc.uaf.edu.anlc
bis-oai.bis.uni-oldenburg.de.UnivOldenburgBIS
http://dispute.library.uu.nl/cgi-bin/oai.pl
documentation.in2p3.fr.in2p3
DSpace at MIT
elib.suub.uni-bremen.de.SUUB
elib.ub.rug.nl.RUGNL
IMAGEBASE.LIB.VT.EDU
lib.umich.edu
http://wo.uio.no/as/WebObjects/theses.woa/wa/oai
http://techreports.larc.nasa.gov/ltrs/oai2.0/
oai.library.uiuc.edu
www.biomedcentral.com.bmc
preprint.chemweb.com.CPS
www.numismatics.org:80.ans

The following repositories are not supporting yyyy-mm-dd format requests:
byu.edu:Ancestry
http://www.ifeanet.org/oai/oai2.php

The following repositories appear to be broken (error on OAI requests):
cds.cern.ch
nsdl.org

Misc:
etdindividuals.dlib.vt.edu.ETDIndividuals appears not to accept a resumption
token it returned
perseus.tufts.edu is responding with HTTP 400 errors for OAI-level errors
(should be HTTP 200 for all OAI responses)
www.davidrumsey.com:8080.Rumsey Collection appears to have broken
flow-control (returns the same token more than once)
xtcat.oclc.org seems to be very slow, may be a problem my end (big
responses?)
rib.cs.utk.edu Identify baseURL is set to localhost (causing much confusion
by my harvester :-)

All the best,
Tim

Message-ID: <AE6AC6CF-32CF-11D7-A798-0003934778A8@v2.nl>

This seminar about copyright and alternatives includes a presentation  
of OAI and may be of interest to list members in the Netherlands.

Copy the Rights!
Seminar
Wednesday, 26 February, 11 a.m. – 5 p.m., Calypso, Mauritsweg 5,  
Rotterdam

Copy the Rights! is organized by V2_Organisation, Institute for the  
Unstable Media, in cooperation with Vereniging Digitaal Erfgoed  
Nederland, Dutch Filmmuseum, the Virtual Platform and the Netherlands  
Media Art Institute.

Copy the Rights is part of the Dutch Electronic Art Festival: DEAF03  
Data Knitting.
25 February - 9 March 2003 in Rotterdam
More information at DEAF03 On line: http://deaf.v2.nl
At DEAF03 On line it will be possible to follow the seminar via live  
stream and to participate online in several activities.
Admission: 25,- EUR / 20,- EUR
You may register for the seminar by sending an e-mail to tickets@v2.nl,  
via the festival website http://deaf.v2.nl or by phone: +31 (0)10  
7501515.


Copy the Rights! is a seminar about copyright. It will address various  
copyright aspects of digitizing and opening up archive collections or  
databases (on line), as well as the issue of copyright in a changing  
art practice: unstable art projects that center around recycling and  
copying material often arise out of collaborative efforts where the  
classic notion of authorship no longer applies. In a number of hands-on  
presentations some examples of 'good practice' will be demonstrated.  
Artists from both the Netherlands and abroad will present their  
activities to the audience.

Copy the Rights! has invited a number of prominent foreign speakers to  
inspire the debate on alternative copyright models -- copyleft, open  
source, open content, open access -- and whether these may fit within  
the Dutch context.

Moderator: Paul Rutten, head of the Information and Communication unit  
of TNO STB (NL).

11 a.m.: Introduction and presentation of international initiatives

- Darius Cuplinskas, Soros Foundation (H): Budapest Open Access  
Initiative
The Budapest Open Access Initiative, an initiative of the Soros  
Foundation in Hungary, is an international declaration promoting free  
access to scientific publications.
- Andy Powell, UKOLN (UK): Open Archives Initiative
The Open Archives Initiative has initiated an open protocol that  
addresses the need for the free exchange of scientific publications,  
allowing research databases to exchange information.
- Wendy Seltzer, Berkman Center, Electronic Frontier Foundation (USA):  
Creative Commons and OpenLaw
Creative Commons is an important on-line initiative that enables  
authors and creators to generate 'custom made' licenses for text,  
music, video and images.
- Jon Ippolito, Guggenheim NY and University of Maine (USA): Open Art  
Network and Variable Media Network
The Open Art Network offers a range of recommendations -- aimed  
especially at media and internet artists -- for making artworks more or  
even freely accessible. The Variable Media Network, a preservation  
project for media art, has shown that there is a direct relationship  
between the strictness of copyright and the difficulty of long-term  
preservation.

2 p.m.: Lunch and hands-on presentations

- Kingdom of Piracy <KOP>: illegal copying as an art project
- Dutch Archive for Graphic Designers (NAGO): copyright for online  
poster collections
- Netherlands Media Art Institute: the streaming media project Playing  
Field
- Joost Smiers (NL): copyright and the Third World
- Vereniging Digitaal Erfgoed Nederland: the use of the Open Archives  
Initiative for Dutch cultural heritage projects
- Dutch lawyers in dialogue with the speakers
- Dutch policymakers answer questions from the audience
- V2_: presentation of findings from the research project on copyright  
initiated by V2_ and the Virtual Platform

4 p.m.: Panel discussion

5 p.m.: End

In 2002 V2_, in collaboration with the Virtual Platform and  
representatives of cultural institutes in the Netherlands, has  
initiated a research project on copyright. The project made an  
inventory of copyright issues surrounding the creation, storage,  
opening up and marketing of digital information by cultural institutes,  
did research into alternatives for copyrights and initiated a trial  
project to back up the research. The results of the various workgroups  
will lead to a policy document that will be sent to the departments  
concerned and interested parties. The seminar Copy the Rights! is part  
of this research project and is sponsored by the Mondrian Foundation.
