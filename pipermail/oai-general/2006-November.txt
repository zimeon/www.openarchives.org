 MODS Records
Message-ID: <7.0.0.16.2.20061102114632.027adaa0@uiuc.edu>

-Apologies for cross posting-

The Aquifer Metadata Working Group is pleased to announce the release 
of the final version of the DLF/Aquifer Implementation Guidelines for 
Shareable MODS Records. These are available as a pdf at: 
http://www.diglib.org/aquifer/products.htm under "Schemas, Reports, 
and Communities of Practice."

For those of you attending the Digital Library Federation Fall Forum 
Nov 8-10 in Boston, the Working Group will be holding a Birds of a 
Feather session to discuss the guidelines and other related efforts.

We would like to thank the many reviewers who suggested changes or 
questioned content either through email or at the Birds of a Feather 
(BOF) session at the DLF Forum in Austin, Texas in April 2006. 
Following are some of the major changes made to the final version. 
The Working Group also made some changes based on changes to the MODS 
standard from version 3.1 to 3.2. In addition, we made numerous minor 
changes to both the text and examples to make the guidelines more 
consistent and readable.

Purpose of Guidelines:

The Working Group made a great effort to ensure that the guidelines 
were focused on how to implement MODS for shared records. Whether an 
element (or attribute or subelement) in a record created explicitly 
for the purpose being shareable should be required, recommended, 
optional, or not recommended was partly determined on its usefulness 
(or potential usefulness) by aggregators. Each element includes a 
discussion of how aggregators may use the element. The change in the 
title (from DLF MODS Implementation Guidelines for Cultural Heritage 
Materials to DLF/Aquifer Implementation Guidelines for Shareable MODS 
Records) also reflects this focus. These guidelines are not intended 
to dictate local practice, but to provide a useful structure for 
implementing MODS records for sharing within the DLF Aquifer 
Initiative and potentially in other such initiatives.

What is being described?

The original version of these guidelines recommended describing only 
the digital version of an object in the top-level MODS elements and 
recording information about the analog original in <relatedItem>. 
This question generated many comments from reviewers as well as 
forming the basis for almost an entire BOF session at the DLF 2006 
Spring Forum. Most reviewers thought that this decision was confusing 
and would lead to inconsistent application.

In the final version, the Working Group has tried to keep in mind the 
needs of end-users and aggregators and has tried to provide as simple 
a structure as possible for presenting metadata. The guidelines 
recommend that metadata about content and digital and analog carriers 
all appear in the main record. The guidelines try to make clear how 
an aggregator might use the metadata in services for end-users and 
make recommendations for the inclusion or exclusion of information 
based on that use. <relatedItem> is used only for conxtual 
information, to point to a full metadata record, and to provide 
additional information about intellectual constituent units of the 
resource being described. While this does not provide a clean 
one-to-one record as the Working Group had attempted (and failed) to 
deliver in the first draft of the guidelines, the Working Group does 
feel that this is a practical solution to a very complicated issue. 
Because these guidelines are meant for the 'shared' record, local 
implementations of MODS that adhere more closely to the one-to-one 
principle are still possible.

One and only one URL:

Originally the guidelines had required one and only one <location> 
element with a <url> subelement to link to the resource. Several 
reviewers pointed out that this is not practical given the fact that 
there are often multiple files associated with a resource, for 
example, a high resolution image and thumbnail.

In the final version the guidelines require one <location><url 
usage="primary display">, but allow additional <location><url> as 
long as these do not use the attribute usage="primary display". The 
attribute usage="primary display" was added in MODS 3.2.

Optional <subject><genre> element:

MODS 3.2 added <genre> as a subelement under <subject>, which allows 
legacy complex subjects (e.g. LC Subject Headings) with a form/genre 
subelement to be more appropriately represented in MODS. The final 
version of the guidelines make use of this subelement an option, but 
give strong preference to use of the highest-level <genre> MODS 
element for form/genre terms whenever possible.

In RFC 1738 Tim Berners Lee wrote:

"Users should beware that there is no general guarantee that a URL which
at one time points to a given object continues to do so, and does not
 even at some later time point to a different object due to the
movement of objects on servers."

In theory URLs can also be used as identifiers but in practise this is
plain stupid. There are far better URI namespaces like info: and
urn:nbn: (oai: has not been officially registered yet).

Thanks for your detailed description and references. You wrote:

Both rely on the on the registration of domain-names but that's all. OAI
Intentifiers contains more and http contains more and this "more" does
not match at all!

This obviously is an error in the OAI Identifier guideline. If an
institutuions changes it's domain-name (this happens frequently!) then
they still have the ownership over the oai namespace-identifier they
used before - at least the old identifiers cannot be reused.

By the way the implementation guideline says:

> Domain name registration is used to avoid the need for any additional
> registration service for oai-identifiers.

Sorry, but that's an illusion.

First oai namespace-identifiers are case-sensitive while domain names
are not. Given a domain name you still don't know the namespace identifier.

Second there is no way to determine if a given namespace-identifier has
ever been assigned or not. The existence of a matching domain name does
not tell you if the owner of the domains has even heard about OAI.

And third if you have a namespace-identifier and know that it surely is
an assigned namespace-identifier - how do you finally get the record?

Your proposal seems to solve this issue but it just does not work:

> (b) the sensible management of identifiers within/under that domain:
> If last week I assigned an identifier to an item that disseminates

> http://my.org/quant-ph/9901001

If you assign the same identifier to one resource in one week and to
another resource in the next week then it's not a identifier anymore.
Identifiers are only assigned once in a lifetime. I know that there are
some ISBN assigned twice but this is against the whole idea of
persistent identifiers.

It's less a technical problem but a social problem. In theory we don't
need URI, URN and all that stuff if people would not change their URLs
every week. But that's life.

In theory yes, but not in this world.

> i.e. if an OAI-PMH item has the identifier

And next week the manager of my.org (who does not care about OAI) buys a
content management system so all your assigned identifiers produce a 404.

And next month the my.org company is sold or changes its name so the
domain name has to change because of branding issues.

And next year the my.org company is bancrupt (or it was a funded project
and funding is over). Luckily a library is allowed to archive all the
metadata - of course the library won't buy the my.org domain.


I fear that the term "identifier" is used in a very lax way the more
popular it gets.

Jakob

Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funds two-year LANL project for the 
development of metrics derived from scholarly usage data.

Los Alamos, New Mexico, November 6th 2006 - The Andrew W. Mellon 
Foundation has awarded funding to Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) 
in support of the two-year MESUR project that will investigate metrics 
derived from the network-based usage of scholarly information. The 
Digital Library Research & Prototyping Team of the LANL Research Library 
will carry out the project. Johan Bollen is the Principal Investigator, 
Herbert Van de Sompel serves as an architectural consultant, and Aric 
Hagberg of the LANL Mathematical Modeling and Analysis group serves as 
modeling consultant. Marko A. Rodriguez, PhD student at the University 
of California Santa Cruz and LANL Graduate Research Assistant, supports 
the project's research and development.

The project's major objective is enriching the toolkit used for the 
assessment of the impact of scholarly communication items, and hence of 
scholars, with metrics that derive from usage data. The project will 
start with the creation of a semantic model of scholarly communication, 
and an associated large-scale semantic store that relates a range of 
scholarly bibliographic, citation and usage data obtained from a variety 
of sources.  Next, an investigation into the definition and validation 
of usage-based metrics will be conducted on the basis of this 
comprehensive collection. Finally, the defined metrics will be 
cross-validated, resulting in the formulation of guidelines and 
recommendations for future applications of metrics derived from 
scholarly usage data.  Projects results will be made public on the 
project's web site <http://www.mesur.org/>.

The MESUR project currently has an open position for a software 
developer; a job description is available at 
<http://www.mesur.org/Jobs.html>.

Subject: [OAI-general] EPrints version 3.0 beta release
Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.0.20061107103045.044fc718@pop.ecs.soton.ac.uk>

EPrints version 3.0 beta release puts repository managers and users in control

The first beta release of EPrints version 3.0 gives more control and 
flexibility to repository managers, technical administrators and 
depositors. EPrints is the most widely used professional software platform 
for institutional open access repositories, and this new release will widen 
its appeal especially to institutions looking for a powerful, 
cost-effective repository capable of supporting a diverse range of users 
and digital objects.

Version 3 represents a major leap forward in functionality, offering more 
efficient, time-saving features for the most common repository processes. 
An innovative new plugin architecture enables both non-technical and 
technical administrators to create new, shareable mini-applications that 
will run with EPrints to manage increasing information flows in and out of 
repositories.

EPrints is free open source software. Following the successful launch of 
EPrints Services last year, EPrints is now offering solutions for all 
repository needs, from free to fee-based, directly supported by the expert 
team that develops the software at Southampton University
http://www.eprints.org/services/

As the first free generic software (http://www.eprints.org/software/), 
designed in 2000 to allow any organisation, university, department, group 
or project to build OAI-compliant repositories, EPrints is established as 
the easiest, fastest and cheapest way to set up an IR that can grow to 
accommodate future needs for repositories of open access research 
literature, scientific data, theses, reports and multimedia
http://www.eprints.org/news/features/worlds_best_practice.php

Our award-winning (http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/737) lead developer 
Christopher Gutteridge recommends that anybody planning a new repository 
should seriously consider basing it on EPrints v3: "EPrints v2 was good, 
but v3 is something special."

The beta release of EPrints v3 is available for download at 
http://files.eprints.org/118/

Among the new features displayed by this major new version are:

* Efficient new user interface to streamline deposits and editorial workflow
* Flexible customisation of deposit workflow based on users and deposit 
metadata
* Auto-completion of names for authors, journals, and other metadata types
* Support for third party plugins makes it easier for users to add and 
share new import, export and user interface functions without modifying the 
core code
* Improved XML import/export format
* More efficient full-text indexing
* Export searches as RSS feeds, BibTeX, EndNote, XML, etc.
* Full eprint audit history to support preservation applications
* Improved support for set-up, with a tool to walk installers through much 
more of the process
* Test-data importer to create 100 demonstration records

A beta release typically marks the first stable and usable version of new 
software. It is recommended that new users install this version. Further 
beta and 'release candidate' versions will appear in December, to add 
further improvements and fix minor bugs based on user feedback. Users can 
easily and safely upgrade to successive versions during this phase.

Existing users should initially install EPrints v3 alongside v2 and convert 
their configurations when a v2->v3 script becomes available as part of a 
later v3 release.

EPrints v3.0 will be officially released at the EPrints User Group meeting 
at the international Open Repositories 2007 conference in San Antonio, TX, 
on January 24, 2007

We are glad to announce the publication of the portal Openarchives.eu
(http://www.openarchives.eu <http://www.openarchives.eu/> ) developed by
Horizons Unlimited (Bologna, Italy - http://www.horizons.it
<http://www.horizons.it/> ).

 

This portal uses repositories and collections' descriptions harvested
from the University of Illinois OAI-PMH Data Provider Registry. The
search engine and other editorial contents that complete the originary
database have been developed by Horizons Unlimited.

 

We hope Openarchives.eu will help the OAI community in searching OAI-PMH
compliant digital collections around the world, we also provide a
gateway for searching metadata through the most important service
providers' engines.

 

Openarchives.eu is a contribution to the Open Access community. Our
mission is providing the Italian and European open access community with
a new set of tools for data and service providers in the Universities,
Public Libraries and the Public Administration. 

 

Please refer to our web site (http://www.horizons.it
<http://www.horizons.it/> ) for more details on our OAI-PMH services.

 

We will be very grateful for any suggestion, comment, correction,
integration or new infos you will send us to make our work better.
