Subject: [OAI-general] Beginners Question
Message-ID: <3CFDEDB5.3752AAA9@zpid.de>

Hello,
we are at the onset of a project planning to document and archive
psychological raw data sets as addidition to the publications. We are
going to describe the data sets with metadata (XML) and store them in a
database. Researchers should have access to a variety of aspects, e.g.
research instruments, variables, methods. We plan to use our existing
LinuxApacheMysqlPerl-Components.

The local University Library here presently has no plans to implement a
metadata harvesting service within the near future.

The question: Should our descriptions of data sets follow rules
compliant to OAI repositories/protocols? Could our developing collection
this way become perhaps compatible without extensive reformatting at
some later dates?
Should we attend the "2.nd workshop on the OAI" (CERN, close by)?
Any comments would be appreciated,
Regards, Juergen

yes.  (did you expect a different answer from this list? ;-)

actually, I would recommend that you design your collection to fit your
needs, and then add on the OAI interface.  the OAI-PMH is very simple to
implement, so I would not let the OAI dictate the requirements of your own
collection.

however, you can do things to ease the transition, such as using
*qualified* Dublin Core for your metadata format.  It will be easy to
export the qualified DC, and will be extremely simple to down shift to
unqualified DC for export as well.  

also, since you're using LAMP systems, you might investigate using the s/w
from www.eprints.org -- it might suit your needs.

> Should we attend the "2.nd workshop on the OAI" (CERN, close by)?

absolutely.  there is no substitute for meeting & talking with people who
are already doing OAI or are in a similar situation as yourself (thinking
about OAI).

Michael

Hi

I wanted to let you know that I have updated the myOAI search interface and
added the following features:

- Added a recommender system which suggest other documents perhaps worth
looking at based on prior search and retrieval patterns of other users.

- Changed the way in which databases are selected, now they are displayed
as a list rather than databases with checkboxes, this is to accommodate
their growing numbers.

- Added the ability to run a meta-search, displaying the total number of
results  per database before displaying the search results, the user can
then pick  which database(s) they want to see results for.

- Added the ability to group the search results by database, the user can
then pick which database(s) they want to see results for.

- Added documents viewed to the search history, now you can see both your
previous searches and all the document you viewed in reverse chronological
order.


You can get to the myOAI web site at the following URL:

    http://www.myoai.com/

I also have a Perl based harvester which is OAI V2 compliant and would be
happy to put it up on the web site for download if there is interest. I will
warn you now that it is pretty simple, but it is effective.

Please feel free to send me feature requests, feedback, comments,
criticisms, etc...

Best regards

François

Open Archives Initiative Releases Version 2.0 of the Protocol for
Metadata Harvesting 


Ithaca, NY +ACY- Los Alamos NM-The Open Archives Initiative is pleased to
release version 2.0 of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for
Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). The release of OAI-PMH v.2.0 comes after
16 months of worldwide experimentation with version 1.x of the protocol,
an 8 month revision process by the OAI-tech group, and 4 months of
alpha/beta testing. Thanks to this rigid testing and revision, we feel
confident to release the OAI-PMH version 2.0 as a stable specification. 

A full copy of this press release with information about the features of
OAI-PMH version 2 is available at
http://www.openarchives.org/news/oaiv2press020614.html. 

The OAI-PMH version 2 specification is available at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm.

Visit the OAI web site at http://www.openarchives.org for more related
information.

Subject: [OAI-general] Status of my.OAI
Message-ID: <B9406E42.5682%francois@fsconsult.com>

Hi

I wanted to update everyone on the status of my.OAI. Unfortunately I am
going to have to pull the plug on further development of the system. I am
going to be putting in one final update this weekend and that will be all,
and it is very likely that I am going to pull the system altogether at the
end of July. 

This project has been fun to work on and I started off with three goals:

- First was to develop a new search user interface to my search engine on
top of a new API I developed which allows searching of very different
databases with a single U/I. This was achieved rather well I feel, the U/I
can search databases served up by my own search engine or databases on
PubMed without modification.

- Second was to provide a good, free, search interface to the slowly
increasing volume of OAI accessible data out there, I think that was
achieved too.

- Third was to focus some attention onto my products and my consulting
services by building a showcase system and generate some business. That part
has not worked out at all. The fact that the consulting market appears to
have collapsed makes it very difficult for me to justify keeping this system
running, indeed my collocated server.

So unless things really pick up, which I doubt given the current state of
the economy, I will most likely be pulling the system at the end of July.

Best regards

Francois

Hello,
I am planning to set up a discipline-based e-print archive covering the field of 
information sciences and librarianship, containing Croatian authors contributions.
So far, I couldn't have found any simmilar project, except the "Caltech Library System 
Papers and Publications" (which is institution-based).
I would appreciate any information on librarianship or information sciences related 
repositories (set up, or under development).

  Under development, work by the rclis project. rclis stands for 
  "research in computing, library and information science". It is
  pronounced "reckless" and it is. A homepage for
  this work is not yet available, but the ideas are similar
  to the work of the RePEc http://repec.org. We would be delighted
  to work with you. An email list is available at

Hello,

You have in France http://archivesic.ccsd.cnrs.fr/
It has just started since one month. Its field is larger than yours, about
what we call in France Sciences de l'information et de la communication, i.
e. also communication research or media research.
You can join Gabriel Gallezot  <gabriel.gallezot@free.fr> to have more
details about it.

Yours sincerely,

The arXiv Computing Research Repository (CoRR) at
http://arxiv.org/archive/cs/intro.html contains some categories which border
on or overlap with information science and librarianship, for example,
digital libraries, and information retrieval.  I'm not sure how much
depositing is done by librarians--my impression is that librarianship is one
of those fields in which publishers try to discourage preprinting.
