Dear Gretchen,

Pity I didn't get this in time. The outcome was (surprisingly)
good!  Until now, the Berlin Declaration was just an abstract
expression of principle. The institutions who signed declared
they were "for" Open Access -- but without any indication of
what might be done practically to *provide* Open Access.

This meeting was meant to formulate a practical policy that institutions
can adopt to *implement* the Berlin Declaration, and the policy is
simple, and almost exactly identical to the recommendation of the UK
Select Committee (which was *rejected* by the UK government!):

(1) Institutions who commit themselves to implementing the
Berlin Declaration will adopt it as a policy that all their
researchers must place all their published research articles
in their own institutional open access repository.

(Several institutions that have already adopted this policy have said
that the way they implement it is that their researchers must deposit
the metadata and the full text, otherwise they will be "invisible"
for research assessment: The institutional repository will be the
data on which their performance assessment and the institution's own
record-keeping of its own research output will be based.)

This is almost is *exactly* what the UK Select Committee recommended:

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmsctech/399/39903.htm

(2) Apart from *requiring* the above, the implementation policy
*encourages* publishing in an Open Access Journal *if a suitable
one exists.* (This is not, and cannot be, a requirement, as
authors must be allowed to select their own journals, and only
5% of journals are Open Access Journals.)

The outcome is important for 4 reasons: 

(a) It gives the signers of the Berlin Declaration a clear direction
as to what should be done to implement the Berlin Declaration,
concretely and practically speaking.

(b) It provides the world with an alternative to the recent NIH-12
policy (which merely encourages NIH fundees to self-archive in NIH's
central repository, Pub Med Central, within 12 months of publication --
instead of *requiring* them to self-archive *immediately* in their own
institutional repository.

(c) It is very likely now to be adopted widely (and has already been
adopted de facto by a number of the participants in this meeting,
including the huge national research network of France, the CNRS,
its counterpart in Germany, the Max-Planck- Institutes, the CERN
mega-lab in Switzerland, all 12 major Universities in the Netherlands,
the University of Southampton in the UK (from whom the model for the
policy first came, both here and for the Select Committee) and
soon, we hope, the UK research councils (RCUK). There were similar
policies also already adopted by Italian, Australian, Scandinavian
and Portuguese universities (to varying degrees: but now this too will
increase).

(d) As a consequence, there should soon be a big increase in Open Access
worldwide, and (we hope) it will at last reach 100% before too much
longer!

Best wishes,

Subject: [OAI-general] Grid Technologies for Digital Libraries - A DELOS
 Tutorial at the EGEE Conference in Athens, Greece, April 16, 2005
Message-ID: <005f01c52fc8$4cb34970$0e573092@isti.cnr.it>

Apologies to those who may receive this announcement on more than one
mailing list.

Please circulate the announcement below to other interested persons and
communities. Thank you

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Digital libraries are now moving far beyond any connotation of the term
"library", and are rapidly shifting towards more general systems,
sometimes known as Dynamic Universal Knowledge Environments. A major
advantage of these environments is that they will permit groups of
individuals, collaborating together to achieve a common goal, to access,
discuss and enhance on-line shared complex, multimedia, multitype
digital information objects.

A radical change in current Digital Library systems is needed if we want
to be able to provide these new collaborative environments. New
technologies  must be investigated to support their implementation and
new organizational and development models must be introduced.  

By providing a framework that supports a highly coordinated sharing of
resources where large computational and storage capabilities can be
exploited, the Grid is one of the most interesting candidate basic
technologies for building these new generation digital library systems.

In order to present the current status of the most advanced Grid
technologies and the opportunities they offer for digital libraries the
DELOS Network of Excellence on Digital Libraries, in collaboration with
the EC projects EGEE and DILIGENT, organises a tutorial on "Grid
Technologies for Digital Libraries". 

The tutorial will be held in Athens in conjunction with the Third EGEE
conference on 16th April 2005. The scientific programme of the tutorial
is available at the address
http://agenda.cern.ch/fullAgenda.php?ida=a051871 
Information about registration can be found at the address
http://www.terena.nl/events/?eventID=136 

The registration fee is 30 Euro. It includes coffee breaks and lunch.
