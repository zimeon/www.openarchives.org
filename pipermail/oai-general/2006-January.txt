Anyone out there have (or know of) an existing open source OAI repository that
delivers MODS?
  Since the Aquifer project will require this (and other modifications), this
will be in demand...  so I thought I'd ask if there's one out there before
we all start  writing our own.

Thanks!

Welcome to JCDL 2006

The Joint Conference on Digital Libraries is a major international forum
focusing on digital libraries and associated technical, practical, and
social issues. JCDL encompasses the many meanings of the term "digital
libraries," including (but not limited to) new forms of information
institutions; operational information systems with all manner of digital
content; new means of selecting, collecting, organizing, and distributing
digital content; digital preservation and archiving; and theoretical
models of information media, including document genres and electronic
publishing.

Paper Submission

Full and short papers will be included in the conference proceedings and
will be presented at the conference. Papers must be in English with a
limit of 10 pages (approximately 5000 words) for full papers and 2 pages
for short papers. All papers must be original contributions (i.e., not
have been previously published or currently under review for publication
elsewhere). All contributions are to be submitted in electronic form via
the JCDL conference web site, following ACM format guidelines and using
the template provided. Preferred submission formats are PDF or Microsoft
Word. The conference will award the Vannevar Bush Award to the best full
paper.

Panels, Posters, and Demonstrations

Panels and posters provide opportunities to present work-in-progress,
late-breaking results, or other efforts that would benefit from discussion
with the community. Successful panel proposals should involve a
controversial or emerging topic and articulate and entertaining panelists.
Panel proposals must consist of a title, a 1-page extended abstract
explaining the topic and goals of the session along with a list of titles
of individual presentations and/or viewpoints and contact information for
the organizer, moderator, and panelists. Posters permit presentation of
late-breaking results in an informal, interactive manner. Poster proposals
should consist of a title, a 1-page extended abstract, and contact
information for the authors. Accepted posters will be displayed at the
conference and may include additional materials, space permitting.
Abstracts of panels and posters will appear in the proceedings.
Demonstrations will allow attendees to have first-hand views of innovative
digital libraries technology and applications and to talk informally with
system developers and researchers. Demonstration proposals should consist
of a title, a 1-page extended abstract, and contact information for the
authors. Abstracts of demonstrations will appear in the proceedings. All
contributions are to be submitted in electronic form via the JCDL
conference web site.

Tutorials and Workshops

Proposals for tutorials and workshops are also solicited. Tutorials are
intended to present a single topic in detail over either a half-day or a
full day. Tutorial proposals should include: a tutorial title; an abstract
(1-2 paragraphs, to be used in conference programs); a description or
topical outline of tutorial (1-2 paragraphs, to be used for evaluation);
duration (half- or full-day); expected number of participants; target
audience, including level of experience (introductory, intermediate,
advanced); learning objectives; a brief biographical sketch of the
presenter(s); and contact information for the presenter(s). Tutorial
proposals should be emailed directly to the tutorial chair. For further
information please contact the tutorial chair.

Workshops are intended to draw together communities of interest in a new
or emerging issue and provide a forum for discussion and exploration.
Submissions should include: a workshop title and short description; a
statement of objectives for the workshop; a topical outline for the
workshop; identification of the expected audience; a description of the
planned format, duration (half- or full-day), and expected number of
attendees; information about how the attendees will be identified,
notified of the workshop, and, if necessary, selected from among
applicants; as well as contact and biographical information about the
organizers. Finally, if a workshop has been held previously, information
about the earlier sessions should be provided -- dates, locations,
outcomes, attendance, etc. Workshop proposals should be emailed directly
to the workshop chair. For further information please contact the workshop
chair.

Hi Jody-

The IU OAI data provider Kat mentions below runs off of the University
of Oldenburg PHP data provider software
<http://physnet.uni-oldenburg.de/oai/>. We had to modify it to allow
metadata formats supplementing DC, however. I believe the modification
was a fairly simple hack, just adding another field in the database in
which we stick the entire MODS record for serving out. We're looking at
moving to a more robust data provider in the forseeable future as well,
as Fedora-based OAI data providers develop.

Jody,

Background on the OCLC Research Publications system can be found at
http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march05/hyatt/03hyatt.html. In summary,
however, the software used in that effort has been superseded by the
WikiD project: http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/wikid/default.htm.

Message-ID: <s3bba350.037@loc.gov>

Jody,

LC's OAI repository delivers MODS, but is not open source software ready to use by others.  Our OAI setup is quite closely linked to the rest of the workflow and systems underlying American Memory and other presentations of digitized historical collections at LC (Global Gateway,  Prints and Photographs Online Catalog).

To date, we have simply been using the MARC to MODS stylesheet provided by LC's standards office, with the underlying records being in MARC.  That doesn't currently yield MODS compliant with the DLF Aquifer guidelines.  At some point, that will change, but I'm not sure when.   Making native MODS records OAI-harvestable is also on the to-do list, but without a firm timeframe.

If it's a content repo you need, DSpace can deliver MODS, albeit
crosswalked from a qualified DC source record.

As of version 1.3.2, the MODS is delivered embedded in METS DIPs via
METS export tool.  In 1.4, which should be finished in Q1, you'll also
be able to get at it directly via OAI-PMH, and potentially via the new
web service interface (WebDAV actually), if that is ready in time.

Message-ID: <7.0.0.16.2.20060113161110.0247e1b0@uiuc.edu>

Please excuse the cross-posting.

The deadline for public comment on the DLF MODS Implementation 
Guidelines for Cultural Heritage Comments has been extended to 
February 3rd, 2006 (originally slated to end on January 20, 2006). 
Please see the message below for the link to the guidelines and how 
to send in comments.

The Digital Library Federation's Aquifer Initiative is pleased to 
invite public review and comment on the DLF MODS Implementation 
Guidelines for Cultural Heritage Materials available at 
http://www.diglib.org/aquifer/DLF_MODS_ImpGuidelines_ver4.pdf (pdf 
document about 470 kb).

The primary goal of the Digital Library Federation's Aquifer 
Initiative is to enable distributed content to be used effectively by 
libraries and scholars for teaching, learning, and research. The 
provision of rich, shareable metadata for this distributed content is 
an important step towards this goal. To this end, the Metadata 
Working Group of the DLF Aquifer Initiative has developed a set of 
implementation guidelines for the Metadata Object Description Schema 
(MODS). These guidelines are meant specifically for metadata records 
that are to be shared (whether by the Open Archives Initiative 
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI PMH) or other means) and that 
describe digital cultural heritage and humanities-based scholarly resources.

In order to ensure the Implementation Guidelines are useful and 
coherent, we are collecting comments and feedback from the wider 
digital library community. We appreciate any and all comments, 
feedback, and questions. These may be sent to 
DLF-MODS-GUIDELINES-COMMENTS-L@LISTSERV.INDIANA.EDU. The deadline for 
comments is February 3rd, 2006.

Thank you.
