Message-ID: <C07CE34C.49863%abell@highwire.stanford.edu>

Stanford University's HighWire Press has developed an OAI 2.0 service with
the Base URL:

 http://open-archive.highwire.org/handler

We will be registering the availability of the content from the first of our
Journal publishing partners, Oxford University Press, but I wanted to let
the list know first to see if anyone had any comments or questions before we
completed the registration and the announcement.

The metadata (citation and abstract) is available for the journals found at:

[second announcement]

JCDL Tutorial 12: Metadata and Resource Exchange Using the Open Archives 
Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting

Details are available on the JCDL 2006 website (at a new location):
   http://jcdl2006.org/program/tutorials/afternoon#tut-12
(afternoon of Sunday June 11).


Following the success of this strategy for the tutorial at OAI4 in Geneva 
last year, I encourage participants to send brief email comments on their 
background and expectations. In particular, answers to the following 
questions would be allow me to target the tutorial appropriately:

1. Have you implemented, or been involved in a significant way in 
implementing one or more OAI-PMH data providers? If so, using what 
packages and/or programming languages?

2. Have you harvested and processed a significant amount of metadata from 
other sites using OAI-PMH?

3. How extensively have you worked with XML? In particular have you worked 
with XML-related technologies such as XML Schemas and XSLT?

4. Are you interested in resource exchange using the OAI-PMH, or just 
metadata exchange?

5. What do you most hope to know more about by the end of the tutorial?

I'm also happy to answer questions ahead of time about whether this 
tutorial will meet you needs.

Cheers,
Simeon
