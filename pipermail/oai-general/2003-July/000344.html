***

Details:

The event will focus on good practice in the implementation of open
archives. A particular theme of the workshop will be the use of the Open
Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting [OAI-PMH] in the area
of Cultural Heritage. The workshop will also be looking at the use of the
OAI protocol as a way of publishing information about university theses,
and how that might contribute to developing useful content for
institutional (as opposed to subject-based) eprint archives.

The workshop will build on issues discussed during the whole project, and
draw inferences about best practice. These include technical issues,
organisational issues and Intellectual Property Rights. A report on
organisational issues written by a OAForum working group will be
discussed at the workshop. Breakout sessions will offer the opportunity to
discuss issues of practice with others working at the sharp end of
implementation.

There also will be an introduction to one of the project's key
deliverables: an online tutorial which will give guidance to those wishing
to implement a project using the OAI-PMH. This tutorial will be based on
the experience of the successful pre-workshop tutorials held in Lisbon
(2002) and Berlin (2003).

There will be a  poster session to allow  project dissemination, and  time and space for
 networking. Those wishing to submit a poster should contact Sara Hassen (<A HREF="mailto:s.hassen@ukoln.ac.uk">s.hassen@ukoln.ac.uk</A>)

There will be representatives of the Open Archives Initiative 
present at the workshop, as we have had at earlier workshops, 
and there will be other important figures in the open archives world present. 
There will be contribution from LIBER and SPARC on the current status of Open Access. 
A panel session closing the second day of the workshop will offer the opportunity 
to exchange views about the future direction of open archives, and about our experience of the open 
archives approach so far.

The Open Archives Forum is a EU funded project, whose purpose is to explore
the possibilities of the open archives idea in the European context, and to
facilitate access to relevant information. More information can be found on the Open Archives Forum website at: <A HREF="http://www.oaforum.org/">http://www.oaforum.org/</A>
