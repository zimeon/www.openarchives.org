Satellite meeting at SUB Goettingen to be held in conjunction with the IFLA=
=20
Conference in Berlin

On behalf of the G=F6ttingen State and University Library (SUB), the Dublin=
=20
Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), and the Information Technology Section of=
=20
the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions=20
(IFLA) we would like to invite you to the Satellite meeting:

&quot;Information Technology and DCMI&quot;
<A HREF="http://post-ifla.sub.uni-goettingen.de/">http://post-ifla.sub.uni-goettingen.de/</A>

being held at the G=F6ttingen State and University Library (SUB), Germany=20
from 11th August to the 12th of August 2003.
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open forum engaged in the=20
development of interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad=
=20
range of purposes and business models. DCMI's activities include=20
consensus-driven working groups, global workshops, conferences, standards=20
liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of=20
metadata standards and practices.
The IFLA Information Technology Section (ITS) serves to promote and advance=
=20
the application of information technologies (IT) to library and information=
=20
services in all societies, through activities related to standards,=20
education and training, research, and the marketplace. ITS scope includes=20
IT for the creation, organization, storage and maintenance, retrieval, and=
=20
transfer of information and documents of all types of libraries and=20
information centers. It also includes IT for the operation of libraries and=
=20
information centers, as well as managerial and policy issues regarding IT.=
=20
Of primary importance are network and wireless technologies as they apply=20
to IT as well as applications of IT for supporting access to and delivery=20
of information.
The G=F6ttingen State and University Library, Germany (SUB) is an=
 outstanding=20
German academic library with numerous rare and comprehensive collections.=20
In several research projects the SUB has proved to be a leading institution=
=20
in the field of Digital Library and online information services. For=20
digitization activities the SUB runs a sophisticated digitization and=20
service center (GDZ). The SUB's qualification to combine the preservation=20
of cultural heritage with future-oriented technology has been recognised by=
=20
the award &quot;Library of the Year 2002&quot;.

Topics/Scope
The scope of this Satellite meeting will not only be to demonstrate new=20
developments in the field of (Dublin Core) metadata and their=20
implementations, but also to encourage even more organisations around the=20
world to use the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting=
=20
to exchange and share metadata collections (repositories).
Further objectives include discussions about important related issues like=
=20
long-term preservation and metadata registry.
One further important focus will be based on questions of follow-ups for=20
the next Dublin Core conference this year in Seattle (Washington, USA) from=
=20
the 28th of September to the 2nd of October 2003 and the DCMI's National=20
Affiliate concept.
For the Satellite meeting we expect an international range of interesting=20
talks exploring common approaches and challenges to the topic of DCMI=20
(state of the art report), metadata issues, long-term preservation, OAI and=
=20
registry. It will focus on different hot topics, like national OAI=20
activities, Dublin Core experiences and the daily use as well as special=20
preservation approaches.

Who should attend
all who are working with or interested in aspects of the Dublin Core=20
Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and/or the use of Dublin Core metadata
people from libraries, museums who are considering making their=20
repositories (metadata collections) of information available via the=
 Internet
researchers and scientists who are interested in long-term preservation,=20
and copyright and DRM issues and
decision makers and project managers who are interested in new=20
projects/initiatives and approaches in the Digital Library developments

Dates
