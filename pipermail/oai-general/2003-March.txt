Subject: [OAI-general] 3rd OAForum Workshop detailed programme available
Message-ID: <3E676744.90906@rz.hu-berlin.de>

We, the Open Archives Forum, are pleased that we can now offer a detailed programme of the 3rd Open
Archives Forum Workshop Networking Multimedia resources, which will be held in Berlin on 27-29th
March, 2003. More detailed information youll find on the Open Archives Forum website
(http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/berl_programme.php).

The aim of the Berlin workshop is to explore which specific requirements and demands ought to be
carefully weighed and considered before a digital media archive is made available via the Internet.
Within this workshop we will discuss different approaches to network media repositories, libraries,
archives and other information resources using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting (OAI-PMH).

A tutorial on the implementation of OAI-PMH will be held the day before the workshop (on March 27th)
for those who are not familiar with this protocol. Herbert van de Sompel (Cornell University) will
present the current status and activities of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI).

Different international projects (Prometheus, Myless/MyCoRe, Ninch Guide, ArtWorld, MIND) will give
an idea of their work and present their practical implementation for the building of networks and
open archives. Besides all, participants are invited to discuss key issues in small group breakout
sessions, such as: metadata for multimedia objects, technical copyright enforcement and Open Access
and share experiences with tools.

Registration on the Open Archives Forum website:
http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/berl_registration.php
Please register soon. Places are limited.

Hi, I am not a subscriber to this list so please send any replies to me
directly.

I am the coordinator of the IVOA (1) workgroup set up to define
interoperability standards for registries (2) of astronomical data and
services. We have convened a kickoff meeting (3) for the group on 19-20
March in London (4). Participants will attend from UK and Europe.

One member of the working group has suggested that we take the OAI
protocols as a base for our standards (5). Unfortunately, he is unable
to make this meeting and I was wondering if anyone from the OAI
community based in the UK could come and give us a presentation about
the OAI and its standards for metadata and harvesting.

I realise this is short notice (and this is the reason none of our US
members can attend) but we would be very grateful if someone experienced
in this area could spare us the time for such a presentation. I'll be
happy to bring anyone up to speed with our deliberations if they want to
pitch the talk to our needs and we will meet any reasonable travel
expenses.

If you are interested in helping us out in this way, please email me
directly at ael@star.le.ac.uk with a brief description of your work in
the OAI field.

Many thanks,
Tony.

Message-ID: <Pine.SO4.4.05.10303120022390.13294-100000@lamin.ukoln.ac.uk>

[This message is being forwarded to a number of mailing lists].

The 'ePrints UK' project is developing a series of national,
subject-focused services through which the UK education community (and
others) can access the collective output of eprints available from
OAI-compliant eprint archives, particularly those provided by UK
universities and colleges.

 http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/

In order to encourage consistent usage of 'simple' Dublin Core metadata
within eprint archives (the 'oai_dc' format), we have developed a document
entitled "Using simple Dublin Core to describe eprints", available at

 http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/docs/simpledc-guidelines/

The intention is to facilitate more consistent results when searching and
browsing metadata records gathered from multiple eprint archives.

Comments on this document are very welcome and can be addressed privately
to me (a.powell@ukoln.ac.uk) or publically on this list.

Regards,

Andy

I am quite happy to defer to the technical OAI experts on this one, but let
us put the question precisely: 

Thomas Krichel suggests that institutional (OAI) data-archives
(full-texts) should "feed" disciplinary (OAI) data-archives,
because OAI-interoperability is somehow not enough. I suggest that
OAI-interoperability (if I understand it correctly) should be enough. No
harm in redundant archiving, of course, for backup and security, but not
necessary for the usage and functionality itself. In fact, if I understand
correctly the intent of the OAI distinction between OAI data-providers -- 
http://www.openarchives.org/Register/BrowseSites.pl 
-- and OAI service-providers --
http://www.openarchives.org/service/listproviders.html 
-- it is not the full-texts of data-archives that need to be "fed" to
(i.e., harvested by) the OAI service providers, but only their metadata.

Hence my conclusion that distributed, interoperable OAI institutional
archives are enough (and the fastest route to open-access). No need
to harvest their contents into central OAI discipline-based archives
(except perhaps for redundancy, as backup). Their OAI interoperability
should be enough so that the OAI service-providers can (among other things)
do the "virtual aggregation" by discipline (or any other computable
criterion) by harvesting the metadata alone, without the need to harvest
full-text data-contents too.

It should be noted, though, that Thomas Krichel's excellent RePec
archive and service in Economics -- http://repec.org/ -- goes
well beyond the confines of OAI-harvesting! RePec harvests non-OAI
content too, along lines similar to the way ResearchIndex/citeseer --
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs -- harvests non-OAI content in computer
science. What I said about there being no need to "feed" institutional OAI
archive content into disciplinary OAI archives certainly does not apply
to *non-OAI* content, which would otherwise be scattered willy-nilly
all over the net and not integrated in any way. Here RePec's and
ResearchIndex's harvesting is invaluable, especially as RePec already
does (and ResearchIndex has announced that it plans to) make all its
harvested content OAI-compliant!

To summarize: The goal is to get all research papers, pre- and
post-peer-review, openly accessible (and OAI-interoperable) as soon as
possible. (These are BOAI Strategies 1 [self-archiving] and 2
[open-access journals]: http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml
). In principle this can be done by (1) self-archiving them in central
OAI disciplinary archives like the Physics arXiv (the biggest and
first of its kind) -- http://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions

or by (4) publishing them in open-access journals (BOAI Strategy 2:
http://www.soros.org/openaccess/journals.shtml ).

My point was only that because researchers and their institutions
(*not* their disciplines) have shared interests vested in maximizing
their joint research impact and its rewards, institution-based
self-archiving (2) is a more promising way to go -- in the age of
OAI-interoperability -- than discipline-based self-archiving (1), even
though the latter began earlier. It is also obvious that both (1) and
(2) are preferable to arbitrary Web and FTP self-archiving (3), which
began even earlier (although harvesting arbitrary Website and FTP contents
into OAI-compliant Archives is still a welcome makeshift strategy
until the practise of OAI self-archiving is up to speed). Creating new
open-access journals and converting the established (20,000) toll-access
journals to open-access is desirable too, but it is obviously a much
slower and more complicated path to open access than self-archiving,
so should be pursued in parallel.

My conclusion in favor of institutional self-archiving is based on the
evidence and on logic, and it represents a change of thinking,
for I had originally advocated (3) Web/FTP self-archiving --
http://www.arl.org/scomm/subversive/toc.html -- then switched allegiance
to central self-archiving (1), even creating a discipline-based archive:
http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ But with the advent of OAI in 1999,
plus a little reflection, it became apparent that
institutional self-archiving (2) was the fastest, most direct, and most
natural road to open access: http://www.eprints.org/ 
And since then its accumulating momentum seems to be confirming that this
is indeed so: http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/2212.html

That may or may not be the case, but in any case it is irrelevant to
the question of which is the more promising route to open-access. Our
primary sense of belonging may be with our family, our community,
our creed, our tribe, or even our species. But our rewards (research
grant funding and overheads, salaries, postdocs and students attracted
to our research, prizes and honors) are intertwined and shared with our
institutions (our employers) and not our disciplines (which are often
in fact the locus of competition for those same rewards!)

But the question is whether this "aggregation" needs to be the "feeding"
of institutional OAI archive contents into disciplinary OAI archives, or
merely the "feeding" of OAI metadata into OAI services.

There is no contradiction. In fact, I suspect this will prove to be a
non-issue, once we confirm that (a) we agree on the need for
OAI-compliance and (b) "aggregation" amounts to metadata-harvesting and
OAI service-provision when the full-texts are in the institutional
archive are OAI-compliant (and calls for full-text harvesting only
if/when they are not). Content "aggregation," in other words, is a
paper-based notion. In the online era, it merely means digital sorting
of the pointers to the content.

You mean self-archiving in arbitrary non-OAI author websites? There is
another reason why institutional OAI archives and official institutional
self-archiving policies (and assistance) are so important. In reality,
it is far easier to deposit and maintain one's papers in institutional
OAI archives like Eprints than to set up and maintain one's own website.
All that is needed is a clear official institutional policy, plus
some startup help in launching it. (No such thing is possible at a
"discipline" level.)

I am sure academics didn't like to be herded into publishing with the
threat of perishing either. Nor did they like switching from paper to
word-processors. Their early counterparts probably clung to the oral
tradition, resisting writing too; and monks did not like be herded from
their peaceful manuscript-illumination chambers to the clamour of
printing presses. But where there is a causal contingency -- as there is
between (a) the research impact and its rewards, which academics like as
much as anyone else, and (b) the accessibility of their research -- academics
are surely no less responsive than Prof. Skinner's pigeons and rats to
those causal contingencies, and which buttons they will have to press 
in order to maximize their rewards!

Besides, it is not *publishing* habits that need to be changed, but
*archiving* habits, which are an online supplement, not a substitute,
for existing (and unchanged) publishing habits.

Agreed. And uploading it into a departmental OAI Eprints Archive is 
by far the simplest way and most effective way to do all of that. All it
needs is a policy to mandate it:

I couldn't quite follow all of this. The bottom line is this: The free
Eprints.org software (for example) can be installed within a few days. It
can then be replicated to handle all the departmental or research group
archives a university wants, with minimal maintenance time or costs. The
rest is just down to self-archiving, which takes a few minutes for the
first paper, and even less time for subsequent papers (as the repeating
metadata -- author, institution, etc., can be "cloned" into each new
deposit template). An institution may wish to impose an institutional
"look" on all of its separate eprints archives; but apart from that,
they can be as autonomous and as distributed and as many as desired:
OAI-interoperability works locally just as well as it does globally.

I don't think I need to get into this. It's not specific to
self-archiving, and a tempest in a teapot as far as that is concerned. An
efficient system can and will be worked out once there is an effective
institutional self-archiving policy. There are already plenty of excellent
examples, such as CalTech:

  I agree. 

  But this is not what I mean by "not enough". I suggest that 
  institutional archives will lie empty unless there are better
  incentives for scholars to contribute to them. If you tell
  them that it will open their scholarship to the world to
  read, they will listen. If you tell them, figures at hand, 
  how much it does, and how much impact they gain---relatively
  to their colleagues in the offices next door---they will act.
  To be able to build such measures, you need to build complicated
  datasets. This is too complex a task to be done in all disciplines
  at once. Therefore you need to work discipline by discipline.

  RePEc is not a harvesting service. RePEc has pioneered the way
  OAI operates before there was OAI. The degree of interoperability
  that it achieves goes way beyond what OAI achieves at present,
  but we are only at the start with OAI, remember. Basically RePEc aims to 
  achieve a type of dataset that will allow to measure impact---as
  mentioned in my first paragraph---but it is not quite there yet.
  In the meantime, it acts as the starting point for a whole bunch
  of user and contributor services.

  Hmm, with you changing your mind, and with more than a little
  reflection over that many years, I think all of us on this
  forum will be convinced that the best road is not an easy topic
  to approach. I don't have the answer either, but I will show
  instead that there is no answer.

  The way I see it that if you want to achieve self-archiving,
  you have to get authors to self-archive. To do that, you need
  to find the right incentives. One way is to have Clifford Lynch
  running around campus, switching off every independent web
  service because it is a security risk, and then force faculty
  to digitally publish through a central facility. Granted, my 
  vision of Clifford's intention is exagerated, but even a milder
  form of it will not succeed. This is no way to run a university.
  Right? So you are left off to find a way in which you have to give
  incentives to academics. Now, please accept my hypothesis that
  publishing is done more with the academic colleagues in mind
  rather than with the university's central administration 
  in mind. Then you inevitably end up with a situation where
  you have to get a whole discipline along to self-archive. As
  long as others in the discipline are not doing it, there 
  is little interest in the individual scholar doing it. They
  may send the paper directly to closed-access publisher facilities
  or, may be in addition, upload it on a web site somewhere.

  Sure, that is why we need institutional support to take the competition
  head on, by maximising the impact of our work. But the object of 
  the competition is still the discipline.

  I understand that. But you can aggregate and aggregate, as 
  long as you not prove that formal archiving is improving impact,
  you are not likely to get far with your formal archiving.

  If this is what authors feel, then this is wonderful. But the
  proof of the pudding is in the eating. If the authors do not
  deposit, you will have to think (yet again) about your best
  strategy.

  Incidentally, have you deposited all your papers in institutional
  archives? I see some ~harnad above. Heaven forbid I tell Clifford
  about this :-)

  Yes, but the arguing in the aggregate is not sufficient, I think.
  You have to demonstrate that to individual academics, figures at
  hand. In the meantime you have to collect formally archive contents.
  Institutional archives is one way, departmental is another way,
  discipline based archiving another, but there is no "right" or
  "wrong" way. Whatever way there is discipline-based services will
  be a key to providing incentives to scholars.

  Faculty should be given the choice. They should not be required
  to do either one. arXiv have been doing a tremendous job at
  archiving. You are not going to replace them. But arXiv really
  only covers a small set of disciplines well.

  I would put this in different way, I'd say that there should be more
  interoperability between institutional archives and disciplinary
  aggregators. Such aggregators don't have a prime function of 
  archiving contents but to put the archival contents into 
  relations with personal and institutional data and
  document-to-document metadata such as citations. Rather
  than marking up the documents content in the institutional
  archive with subject classification data, it should be marked
  up with aggregator data. That is, for example, you may decide
  to export all the computer science papers to rclis. Thus
  you create an rclis set within and inform rclis of this. Then
  they can periodically harvest the data and feed it. In the 
  longer run, we need an extension to the OAI protocol to support
  this on a larger scale. In the meantime, it is perfectly feasible
  to do this here and now with the model aggregator service that
  it out there, the RePEc project. In fact, RePEc does this already
  with the California Digital library, thanks to efforts by
  Roy Tennant and Christopher F. Baum. So, to all those institutional
  archivers out there, if you have an economics department that does
  not already operate a RePEc archive, talk to them, talk to RePEc,
  and set up a OAI set with the Economics papers. It is better,
  within an institution, to proceed department by department and
  listen to what the academics want (and these wants will be 
  different in each department), rather than setting up one 
  archive that is supposed to satisfy everybody's needs at the
  risk of satisfying nobody's.

  It not a pressing concern as much as this appears, because
  discipline-based archives have, arXiv apart, not that much stuff.
  Discipline aggregators, RePEc apart, are still in their infancy.
  I am involved with others in setting up rclis, an aggregator
  for computing and library and information science. One thing
  should be clear: aggregator need years to develop and lots
  of TLC to sustain themselves. 
  
  But I repeat: it is best to listen to academics to tell you 
  what their needs are, rather than setting up procedures around
  a central institutional archive, The latter is what Clifford Lynch wants.
  I don't think that it will work.

This is a very minor technical problem (the interoperability of multiple
OAI Archives containing the same paper) and part of another, slightly
less minor problem, namely, version-control, within and across OAI
Archives (the coordination of multiple versions and revisions of the
same paper, within the same or different OAI archives), plus the
optimization of cross-archive OAI search services:
http://www.openarchives.org/service/listproviders.html

I recommend that this be discussed with the pertinent experts in oai-tech
or oai-general. It is not a general archiving or open-access matter, and
can only confuse researchers (needlessly). For them, self-archiving is
the optimal thing to do, institutionally in the first instance, but also
in a central disciplinary archive if/when they wish; and they should
not worry any further about it. (What is needed, urgently, today, is
universal self-archiving, and not trivial worries about whether to do it
here or there or both: OAI-interoperability makes this into a non-issue
from the self-archiver's point of view, and merely a technical feature
to sort out, from the OAI-developers' point of view.)

A very long transition period from what to what? Right now, most OAI
Archives, whether institutional or disciplinary, are either (1)
non-existent, or (2) near-empty! The transition we are striving for is
from empty to full archives (and let us hope it will not be too long!),
not from disciplinary to institutional archives!

What Chris has in mind is only one, exceptional, special case,
namely, the Physics ArXiv, a disciplinary archive (but the *only*
one) which is, since 1991, well on the road to getting filled in
certain subareas of physics (200,000+ papers) (although even this
archive is still a decade from completeness at its present linear
growth rate: http://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions see slide 10 of
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/tim-arch.htm )

Chris is imagining that if/when the institutions of those physicists
who are already self-archiving in ArXiv adopt an institutional
self-archiving policy like the one in Chris's own department --
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~lac/archpol.html -- then some of those
physicists may wonder why/whether they should self-archive twice!
(A tempest in a teapot! The real challenge is getting all the *other*
disciplines to self-archive in the first place. Don't worry about those
physicists who are already ahead of the game. They are not the
problem!)

No need! First, because the "duplification of effort" is so minimal (the
centrally self-archiving physicists being such an infinitesimal subset
of all that needs to be self-archived -- namely, 2,000,000 articles per
year, across disciplines, not just 200,000 across 10 years, in one
discipline!). And second, because the technical problem (of duplicate
self-archiving) is so soluble, in so many obvious ways!

It is such a small issue that it does not belong in a general discussion
of open access and self-archiving for researchers. It belongs only in a
technical discussion group for developers and implementers of the OAI
protocol. The only issue for the research community is how to get the
OAI Archives created and filled, as soon as possible; and I think it
is becoming apparent that institution-based self-archiving is the most
general and natural route to this goal, for the many reasons already
discussed in this thread.

Of course. Institutional self-archiving does not imply one single
university archive, but an OAI-interoperable network, parametrized to
suit any special needs of each discipline. (That's certainly how Chris's
eprints.org software is being designed: http://software.eprints.org/ )

What is needed is institutional self-archiving, distributed across its
departments interoperably, but customized to the different needs of the
different disciplines.

No problem. This is certainly something the OAI developers can address.
But it has nothing to do with what Chris was worrying about (dupicate
self-archiving in disciplinary and institutional archives); and it seems
to agree about the primacy of institution-based archiving (but
distributed across, and adapted to, the institution's departments and
disciplines).

This seems to contradict what was said before! It would be impossible
to implement an effective, systematic institutional self-archiving
policy if it were optional whether researchers self-archive in their
institutional archive or in a central disciplinary archive (even though
OAI-interoperability makes the two alternatives completely equivalent
from an open-access point of view). Let me count the ways:

(1) Institutions can mandate self-archiving, disciplines cannot.

(2) Most disciplines do not have disciplinary OAI Archives at all.

(3) All institutions have (just about) all disciplines.

(4) There are many other potential uses for institutional research
archives (apart from open access).

(5) OAI-interoperability guarantees that institutional and disciplinary
self-archiving are equivalent from the open-access point of view, but
aggregating institutional packages out of distributed disciplinary
OAI archives is harder (though it is not clear how much harder) than
aggregating disciplinary packages out of distributed institutional
OAI archives.

(6) But it is not the equivalence or ease of aggregation that is relevant
at this point (with most archives non-existent or near-empty) but what
is the most promising and natural way to reach universal open access.
(Return to (1) above.)

Your help with information regarding your experience is sought:

I've received a question from an ACRL section, concerned about the
increasingly common occurrence experienced by some libraries of aggregators
losing full-text  content when publishers attempt to sell their own
journals' full-text directly to libraries, and therefore pull that content
out of the aggregators' package.  Apparently  CSA/Sage is an example of
this.

As described by section members, they are worried that this trend creates
pricing inequities and limits access to materials,  just at a time when many
if not most  academic libraries are facing budget cuts.

I tried gaining additional information by doing some searching on the Web,
but wasn't terribly successful.  Do any of you have experiences with this
kind of shift  away from aggregators to individual publishers, together with
its ramifications for access and budgets?

Thanks!

This has been going on for some time.  It's not new.  The trick is to  build
into your contract some reimbursement or credit on a pro-rated  basis if
some information is removed (regardless of whether that  decision is the
publisher's or the aggregator's).  Beyond that, I'm not  sure what we can
do.  Complain to the publisher?  Certainly, but will it  make a difference? 
Only if we do it "in bulk."

The trouble, in this case, is that the aggregator suffers, although you 
could argue that the aggregator is like the library in this case--taking 
the blame for something that happens up the line.

Eventually, however, librarians are going to have to take a stand.  If  we
pay for it, we should get it.  If it can no longer be provided, we  should
get a rebate.  If the publisher does something we don't like, we  need to
talk to them about it and, ultimately, agree not to buy their  product until
they provide the kind of security and service we want.

I know it sounds much simpler than it is, but I can't see how else we  can
make progress.

The vendors may suffer (I doubt it!), but those who ultimately suffer are
the students who will not have access to the  material.  This will happen
for at least two reasons:

1) Students will not aggressively pursue alternate databases with different
(and sometimes clunky) interfaces when they are  used to the aggregators'
interface.  They want what they want fast. 

2) Financial.  Many libraries have no new money to tap into to subscribe to
yet another database that may have limited use  by students.  We are a small
university and I have a difficult time convincing myself that the amount we
are paying for some  of our specialized databases is worth it for the
limited use they receive overall.

I have a hard time being gracious to the vendors (esp. Sage) who have pulled
their content  from an aggregator (in our case  EBSCOhost).  I will not be
able to subscribe to their content.  I have no new money.

Many publishers do NOT understand how the information they publish is used
by the end user.  I have a brother-in-law who  is a specialty publisher of
books and journals and I had to explain to him why libraries needed to have
unlimited campus use  licenses for his online journals.  He couldn't imagine
why students wouldn't come to the physical library building to use the 
online journals, just as they have used print.  Go figure!

With the fiscal climate in many libraries, maybe the publishers who pull
their data from the aggregators will find out that  libraries really aren't
able to just pay for everything that comes down the pike.

  There have been several cases of content disappearing. In addition to the
Sage titles, I believe that Harvard Business  Review moved from having a
relationship with multiple aggregators to an exclusive relationship with
Ebsco (is that still in  effect?), and the content changes in Academic
Universe have been dizzying.

  I think David and Aline make good points -- particularly the reminder that
libraries should include a clause in their  contracts with aggregators that
loss of content above a certain threshold should trigger a rebate, and the
observation that  publishers often don't understand how their products are
used or the consequences of choosing one or another distribution  channel.
We need to work with publishers to help them understand these things better. 

  But as Aline notes, we need to remember that the aggregators are in a
position similar to that of libraries: they are  mediators with little
control over the first-party publishers whose content they distribute.
Libraries can't control the content  interruption when a publisher's server
goes down, and it's important for our users (faculty, especially) to better
understand  the risks inherent in our network structure. Similarly,
aggregators can't fully control the business decisions made by their 
suppliers. As long as scholarly information is treated as a market commodity
we will face these vagaries and need to  understand them as risks. Another
argument for open-access models in which the revenue stream is independent
of  subscription ...

If a journal editor/publisher can add something (a small but I think  pretty
good scholarly journal, Studies in the Humanities), from our  end the whole
issue is filled with unknowns. If we sign with Ebsco, or  Gale, or anyone,
how much do we charge? If we are online with one of  these aggregators, will
that spell the end of our subscriptions for  printed copies of the journal?
(I would REALLY like some feedback on  THAT one.) Should we go entirely
online? Such are the questions often  raised on EDITOR-L, and as far as I
can tell, no one has come close to  a definitive answer. And the fear of
giving over our publication  operations, to some extent, to an aggregator is
in no small part a  thinking about the future. Say Ebsco or some other major
provider goes  bankrupt. Can't happen? Bet it can. Then what happens to the 
distribution system for scholarly communication? I will keep printing 
copies on actual paper for as long as I can, but what's coming? ...

My experience in recent years mirrors exactly what has been described - the
newspapers were the first to do this, originally contributing content to
packages and now moreorless requiring individual subscriptions to each
newspaper archive.  Lexis-Nexis is infamous for changing content and extent
of backfiles; the Gale Group is also notorious for not offering full
coverage of many issues that they index.  Thus, the story about     
selective content is not a new one.  Monitoring the shifts is labor
intensive at times of severe shortages where staff is already performing a
range of duties.

Information providers are becoming far more multifunctional than just
serving as a mount for databases, or as a serials vendor.  Serving as an
aggregator suggests that they provide a range of services confusing
customers about what they do best.  

I think that previous commentators are totally correct when they suggest
libraries may want to educate their user populations about the network
structure of how we get information and the different models of syndication
and aggregation.  

The Sage effort to offer packages of up to 20 year revolving backfiles of
their journal collections in specified fields, where a subscriber does not
have perpetual access is problematic to me.  Libraries want online access
for a variety of reasons - searching, linking from databases, user
preferences, space planning, etc.  However, annual payments for backfiles
seems redundant.   Taylor & Francis is also changing its course for fulltext
access to its extended family of publications.  From offering several
options, via Ingenta, etc, now T&F and its entire list is moving to
MetaPress, a division of EBSCO, which has hosted some T&F content for quite
a while and more is migrating.  I have also just learned that MetaPress is
also working with Springer and will be the new host of Springer Link. See
http://www.ebscoppf.com/metapress.asp

Learning to cope with even greater dosages of ambiguity appears to be our
natural lifestyle these days.  How successful libraries will be in
influencing publishers remains to be seen.  But I think that there is work
to be done here.

To complicate things further, we are seeing professional societies increase
subscription fees for online access by 75% (AAAS for Science Online in 2003)
trying to offset reduction in membership by raising institutional
subscriptions to maintain the revenue streams. This to me is a more
fundamental problem related to scholarly communication and one I would like
to see addressed.

Disciplinary/subject archives vs. Institutional/Organisation/Region based
archives. This is going to be a key challenge now open archives begin
to gain momentum. 

For example; we are planning a University-wide eprints archive. I am 
concerned that some physisists will want to place their items in both
the university eprints service AND the arXiv physics archive. They may 
be required to use the university service, but want to use arXiv as it
is the primary source for their discipline. This is a duplication of 
effort and a potential irritation.

Ultimately, of course, I'd hope that diciplinary archives will be replaced
with subject-specific OAI service providers harvesting from the institutional
archives. But there is going to be a very long transition period in which
the solution evolves from our experience.

What I'm asking is; has anyone given consideration to ways of smoothing
over this duplication of effort? Possibly some negotiated automated process
for insitutional archives uploading to the subject archive, or at least
assisting the author in the process.

This isn't the biggest issue, but it'd be good to address it before it
becomes more of a problem.

Christopher

Excuse my ignorance, not currently having a comprehensive understanding of
OAI, but is the bigger issue not one of duplication (rather than duplication
of effort). If your physicist places the same item in both archives, and a
service provider (say OAIster for example) harvests from both archives, is
there a mechanism to de-dupe the two identical items? If not then it is
likely that over time duplicate entires will present a major problem.

Is this being addressed??

Cheers

Peter

Subject: [OAI-general] Re: [BOAI] Re: Cliff Lynch on Institutional Archives



Disciplinary/subject archives vs. Institutional/Organisation/Region based
archives. This is going to be a key challenge now open archives begin to
gain momentum. 

For example; we are planning a University-wide eprints archive. I am 
concerned that some physisists will want to place their items in both the
university eprints service AND the arXiv physics archive. They may 
be required to use the university service, but want to use arXiv as it is
the primary source for their discipline. This is a duplication of 
effort and a potential irritation.

Ultimately, of course, I'd hope that diciplinary archives will be replaced
with subject-specific OAI service providers harvesting from the
institutional archives. But there is going to be a very long transition
period in which the solution evolves from our experience.

What I'm asking is; has anyone given consideration to ways of smoothing over
this duplication of effort? Possibly some negotiated automated process for
insitutional archives uploading to the subject archive, or at least
assisting the author in the process.

This isn't the biggest issue, but it'd be good to address it before it
becomes more of a problem.

hi

this may be stating the obvious, but why not use sets for the separate 
disciplines, aimed at particular service providers? i say it that way 
because some disciplines are not well-defined (namely, computer science) 
so such archives may want to play ball with multiple service providers 
and hence may need different sets.

in any event, for something like physics, a simple set might do the 
trick at the source. then, somewhat in keeping with the Kepler model (as 
published in DLib a while back), the service provider can provide an 
interface for potential data providers to self-register. i know this 
sounds dodgy, but think of it as an alternative mechanism for 
contribution. either individual users submit individual papers or groups 
submit baseURLS - both go through some kind of review and while one 
leads to once-off storage, the other leads to periodic harvesting.

what remains a difficult problem, however, is how to recreate the 
metadata used by the service provider as its native format. so, for a 
typical example, if arXiv classifies items using a specific set 
structure, this is certainly not going to be the default for an 
institutional archive. does the service provider automatically or 
manually reclassify? or does it not allow browsing by categories? in 
either event, the quality of the metadata from the perspective of the 
service provider may be an impetus for potential users to want to 
replicate their effort rather than rely on the automated submission from 
their own institutions ... this needs more thought ...

ttfn,

The question of taxonomic classification sets and version-control for
Open Archives is a technical one, so I will not presume to comment on it
except from the point of view of the potential *users* of one particular
kind of Archive Content, namely, unrefereed preprints and refereed
postprints of research papers from one or many or all disciplines: This
-- in the google-age of boolean inverted full-text searchability --
does not require a detailed a-priori taxonomy, as book metadata or the
metadata for other kinds of material might. A fairly general sorting by
discipline should suffice.

I hope that once the number and contents of Open-Access Eprint Archives
for research preprints and postprints have scaled up toward something
closer to universality, the simple metadata descriptors "pre-refereeing
preprint" and "refereed journal article" plus perhaps "discipline name"
will be enough to guide relevant service-providers in automatically
harvesting their relevant metadata. Multiple self-registration seems a
tedious and unnecessary constraint. (Possibly a master-registry of valid
institutions and disciplinary archives will also help, but may not be
necessary unless commercial spamming invades this sector too.)

Worrying about "recreating the categories" in this boolean full-text age
is, I believe, a waste of time (for research preprints/postprints). Just
harness google's harvested full-text to your engine's search capability,
if it is incapable of contending with boolean full-text search on its
own. (Manual reclassification! Heaven forfend! Don't bother classifying
this material in the first place, beyond the simplest of first-cuts,
such as discipline. Any further classification should be algorithmic and
text-data-driven, not manual.)

Again, I speak only for research preprints/postprints, but please let's
not inject any further credibility into the notion that self-archiving
author/institutions will also have to self-advertise by multiple
self-archiving of the same paper. Surely that is one headache that
OAI-interoperability should eradicate from the planet! Self-archiving
itself is self-advertising (and effort) enough. Please let us not
now -- when the momentum is still not big enough -- saddle would-be
self-archivers with needless extra worries, and tasks!

International Workshop on Web-based Collaboratories - from Centres without
Walls to Virtual Community Centres
To be held 8 November 2003, Algarve, Portugal 

In connection with the IADIS International Conference WWW/Internet 2003,
from 5 to 8 November 2003
(http://www.iadis.org/icwi2003)

Call for Papers 

Collaboratories have been defined as 'centres without walls', where
scientists can work together while they are in distant locations. The
original vision of collaboratories saw cooperation amongst distributed
scientists as coordination of work and sharing of knowledge, through shared
affordances for collaboration, in the shape of shared tools, databases and
instruments. During the past decade, national and international research
foundations have funded a series of science collaboratory projects. The
results from these projects have shown that it is feasible to link teams of
scientists, data, tools and facilities through the World Wide Web and
thereby reduce the barriers of time and distance. Recent research on science
collaboratories indicates, however, that design and adoption of new
collaboratories are difficult and uncertain processes. This difficulty has
been ascribed to the lack of broader principles for collaboratory
development. So far, each collaboratory has been built as an independent
effort, with little coordination and exchange of design and usability
experience amongst projects on collaboratories.

Recently, collaboratories have also been defined as 'virtual community
centres' on the web. This concept of collaboratories broadens the previous
metaphor of a distributed science laboratory towards the notion of
collaboratories in use. 'Collaboratories in use' support interactive
knowledge production and integration amongst participants with initially
diverse disciplinary or cultural backgrounds. Examples are collaboratories
in rural telemedicine, cross-national film research and design of
information systems (design collaboratories). Such collaboratories bring
together professionals and laypersons in interactive and often
cross-disciplinary knowledge production and integration. Thereby, research
and design attention is directed to how participants in collaboratories form
social relationships with one another, how they build mutual trust and how
they build common conceptual grounds for their collaboration. Amongst the
challenges facing such collaboratories is that the requirements for common
technological and conceptual tools evolve throughout the use of the
collaboratory itself. This may mean that technologies and conceptual tools
may be developed and integrated in the collaboratory as add-on facilities,
which may result in substantial maintenance problems. On the other hand,
design of collaboratories in use may build on analysis and evaluation of the
growing collaborative practices, for instance of ongoing social processes of
community building and evolving uses of shared technologies and conceptual
tools. This, in turn, may open up to new methodological approaches for
design of collaboratories.

The objectives of this workshop is to direct cross-disciplinary attention to
research and development on web-based collaboratories, that is, to collect
and examine empirical evidence of existing research collaboratories on the
web, to share design methods and technological developments for
collaboratories, as well as to address fundamental research issues. The aim
is build up a cross-disciplinary network of professionals working with
research, design and evaluation of web-based collaboratories.

Papers, short papers and posters/demonstrations from academics,
practitioners and researchers, addressing web-based collaboratories from any
of the following interrelated perspectives are invited:

* Analysis of distributed collaborative work and community-building, e.g.,
how collaborative and individual work practices evolve in a collaboratory,
how common workspaces for cross-cultural or cross-disciplinary collaboration
develop, and how the participants negotiate and build mutual trust.

* Modelling and design, e.g., experience of particular methodological
frameworks for design and evaluation of collaboratories and their advantages
and disadvantages, how theory of social informatics may inspire the
development of conceptual frameworks for design and evaluation of
collaboratories, and how to evaluate the usability of a collaboratory. 

* Conceptual tools, e.g., development of common conceptual grounds through
shared ontologies, classification schemes and taxonomies, the problem of
resolution of conflict and translation of interests amongst participants
using joint conceptual tools, analysis of iterative and interactive joint
construction of conceptual tools, i.e. collaborative classification, and
presentation of shared conceptual tools in web-based collaboratories.

* Technologies, e.g. integration and evaluation of shared artifacts and
resources like instruments and data, annotation toolkit, eg. for web logs,
video-conferencing and document indexing, and toolkit for creating and
maintaining technical infrastructures in collaboratories.

The proposals should reflect the theme of the workshop and each should
indicate into which of the above categories it falls. The workshop will be
composed of the following kinds of contributions:

Full Papers - These include mainly accomplished research results and have 8
pages at the maximum (5,000 words). 
Short Papers - These are mostly composed of work in progress reports or
fresh developments and have 4 pages at maximum (2,500 words). 
Posters/demonstrations - These have one page at the maximum (625 words)
besides the poster itself (or demonstration) that will be exposed at the
workshop.

Papers and posters should be submitted as an e-mail attachment in Word or
RTF format to Hanne Albrechtsen, Workshop Chair, by 10 May 2003 (see contact
information below).

An international program committee will review the proposals, and authors
will be notified of decisions by 16 June 2003. The deadline for submission
of papers to the printed workshop proceedings will be 27 June 2003. 

Important dates:

Submission Deadline - 10 May 2003
Notification to Authors - 16 June 2003
Final Camera-Ready Submission and Early Registration - Until 27 June 2003
Late Registration - After 27 June 2003

hi

well, sure, i agree in principle ... if arXiv and similar projects agree 
to bunch of all physics into a single category and use google for 
searching, with no browsing capabilities, it wouldnt be a problem at all.

similarly, if we grouped together computer science, electrical 
engineering and information systems, that would be ok for gross-level 
interoperability ... once again, assuming searching is the only service 
required. frankfully, i think this is a little simplistic and assumes 
digital libraries are no more than submission+search systems.

[aside: why does eprints support browsing by catgeories ?]

besides, who decides what constitutes a discipline anyway ? has anyone 
ever been able to decide if computer science is engineering or science ?

i think we have more questions than answers here and it isnt as simple 
as you point out or we wouldnt even be discussing this :)

ttfn,

Subject: [OAI-general] De-dupping Records
In-Reply-To: <39ADD754AAD5D51181EA00508BB3359D0A5D250A@exmsb03.curtin.edu.au>

In theory this is easy to do. Each time a service sees a new record it 
performs a search in it's existing collection for near-matches (e.g. 
title+author query). Where an existing record is found to be very 
similar the service bundles together the OAI records under a single 
point (which then links to each of the different locations).

Another advantage of this approach is bundling together multiple parts 
of the same document, or multiple versions (neither of which you want to 
see seperately in a search result).

If I recall Google has looked at this issue as well - but it is faced 
with the technical problem of creating an edit-distance graph between 3 
billion items, whereas for the research literature citations can be used 
to de-dupe.

I am addressing this is my next prototype for Citebase, although things 
become a little hairy building a system which has an abstraction above 
OAI records (a stream of data, which is not necessarily in order, that 
can have dupes, revisions, and parts).

All the best,
Tim.

Hi OAIers,

I agree with hussein so far. Building taxonomies is a lot of
effort. Just for inspiration I'd like to tell what we're doing at this
point:

We created a specialized Search engine that is not only fulltext boolean
based but also enables users to go deeper in thematic fields. We do this
by trainable classifiers that are able to learn which field is discussed
in a text. We're not using the OAI classifications since the underlying
taxonomy varies from archive to archive and we have also material from the
web that is not categorized.

The basic idea behind this system is to enable users to explore
fields of knowledge just by selecting the fields of interest. As a
positive side effect the taxonomy of this system is free configurable so
you may configure a taxonomy for physics, one for chemistry or whatever.
All taxonomies use the same texts in background.

Spoken in technical terms the taxonomy binding of a text is not fixed.
Perhaps it could be a good idea to implement this loose binding for OAI so
taxonomy bindings can be used as an exchangeable schema for archive
providers.

If you're interested please feel free to take a look at:

http://findemaschine.pro-physik.de/?language=e

Try for example the category ->Physics/Astrophysics and use the "further
restrictions" selector to restrict on ->Physics/History of Physics or
->Physics/Geophysics. You will see that the ranking will switch to
exactly the subtopic of interest.

Just my 0.3 cent...
Best Regards from Berlin
Claus

 I have thought about trying to make sets for each subject entry, and then ran
across the idea of a "home set" identifier that would point to the original
association.  But I am just beginning to work with OAI and probably need to
read all the archives. :)

In-Reply-To: <3E82D9EB.2040606@cs.uct.ac.za>

I suppose it was useful, overall, that Chris Gutteridge (unintentionally,
as it turned out) branched his original posting, which began this line
of discussion, to a number of other lists, apart from the OAI-general
list for which it was intended. I have since gradually phased out the
other lists from the discussion, but the value of the exercise was,
I think, in illustrating both the overlap and the distinctness between
the two "OA" movements: (1) the OAI (Open Archives Initiative), with its
technical mandate being to provide digital interoperability, and its
target being the entire digital library, and (2) the BOAI (Budapest Open
Access Initiative), with its activist mandate being to provide open,
free full-text access, and its target being the peer-reviewed research
literature only (and particularly its authors and their institutions).

What is relevant, even central, to the one, can accordingly be not only
irrelevant but downright misleading to the other. I reply below
accordingly:

The Physics ArXiv is a growing centralized subset of the Physics
literature, with its own native search capability, including a taxonomy.
It is the only such archive -- in size, scale and use -- and started
well before the OAI and BOAI. The OAI (also partly inspired by ArXiv)
has now introduced the possibility of distributed archiving, across
disciplines, integrated through interoperability. As such, it has
augmented or even replaced the notion of (1) centralized, discipline-based
archiving, with native search capabilities, by the notion of (2)
distributed, institution-based archiving, with separate OAI search services.

How (and whether) to preserve ArXiv's native search and taxonomy
functions is a technical question I leave to the experts. (One naive
thought is that the taxonomic decriptors applying to a paper are rather
like keywords, so a flat string of them could be preserved as a free-text
keyword-field, which would then be searchable in the usual boolean way;
there are probably tricks for preserving their hierarchical structure too,
if need be.)

But the point is that there are no "similar projects" -- at least not
among the preprint/postprint corpora covered by BOAI. There might be
among the broader kinds of digital collections covered by OAI, but that
is another matter, and it has to be kept distinct from the BOAI, whose
concern is with getting full-text open access to the entire
preprint/postprint literature, across all disciplines and institutions,
and as soon as possible, and hence with a minimum of obstacles (of which
the design and application of discipline-specific taxonomies, by way
of a prerequisite or constraint, would indeed be one).

To set one's intuitions, it is best to imagine searching the ISI
(Institute for Scientific Information) database, which is
multidisciplinary and covers the metadata, abstracts, and references for
about 7500 journals. Imagine this augmented to all disciplines,
all journals (about 20,000) and full-text. ISI has some very general
discipline classifiers, but that's all. And that's all that's needed to
confer a wealth of searching/navigation power, especially once augmented
by google-style full-text boolean search. No doubt such a corpus could
and would be augmented by further metaclassification schemes, but those
will be derived algorithmically, a posteriori, from the corpus itself,
rather than as a human pre-tagging, pre-classification process, applied
to each article as it is entered.

(Alerting, for example, would be a customized boolean rule, and probably
agent-based, applied across archives, rather than being a local-archive,
taxonomy-based function.)

Digital libraries are no doubt more than that. But for the special
subset of the digital corpus that is the sole focus of the open-access
movement (the peer-reviewed research literature) and its main users
(researchers), searching is indeed the only service required. (This
of course includes scientometric as well as agent-based search.)
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/Ariadne-RAE.htm

> [aside: why does eprints support browsing by catgeories ?]

Good question! My answer would be that it is merely to support local
functionality. Whereas no one else on the planet may wish to search
only the Southampton ECS department's archive for work on agent-based
auctions, someone here at Southampton might. (But even this could be
done by a suitably constructed boolean search, shrewdly using the OAI
tags as well as the full-text, via a cross-archive search engine.) I
would be inclined to agree that, as institutional archives proliferate
and grow, their local search and taxonomic functions will fade out,
eclipsed by the powerful OAI cross-archive search capabilities.

If you think classifying disciplines is arbitrary, consider the
fuzziness of the rest of the taxonomic tree!

I am sure there are taxonomic complexities crucial for the digital library
in general that exceed my imagination and escape my technical inexpertise,
but I doubt they pertain to the peer-reviewed research literature (20K
journals) in particular -- and the immediate and urgent need of its
would-be users, which is for complete, full-text, open access online.

Subject: [OAI-general] question about using the Va Tech provider
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.53.0303271543550.4027@godzilla1.acpub.duke.edu>

I'm working on establishing OAI provider services, starting with a
metadata set related to a particular project.  We're using the Va Tech
"VTOAI OAI-PMH2 PERL Implementation", running on a Solaris machine, under
Apache server cgi.  The data set is derived from several sources; we've
worked to convert it all into flat XML files.

We have, I believe, about 16k records.  When using the repository explorer
at http://oai.dlib.vt.edu to test our setup with smaller data sets (up to
1k records) it works fine.  However, in recent days I've transferred up
about 10k records for testing, and now we're finding that we're getting
time-out errors.

I've spoken with someone in the past who implemented the Va Tech
implementation using FastCGI in Apache, and they said they had good
results with it.  But I was working with our sysadmin today to set this
up, and we've been getting 500 (internal server) errors when we test;
mainly, I think, because we're not completely sure about how to wrap the
oai.pl process in FastCGI.

I know that the author of the Va Tech implementation is on this list, as
well as others who seem to have a fair amount of experience with OAI
implementations.  So I'm seeking some advice.  Is the Va Tech
implementation, plus or minus FastCGI, sufficiently robust to handle a
repository of 15k+ XML-file records?  If so, and we need to use FastCGI,
can someone offer some guidance on using them together?  And if not,
should we consider another provider framework, and which one?

Thanks in advance...

Will

hi

(this should have gone to oai-implementors so i am cross-posting it)

regarding the VTOAI code i published a while ago, there isn't much it 
does that can lead to a scalability problem. offhand, the only time a 
large chunk of data is needed is when you ListRecords (and maybe 
ListIdentifiers).

in any event, i do not suggest 10k records - what is the byte size of a 
typical response ? 30MB ? thats really too much ...

the memory needed to store and process that is probably the cause of the 
problem from the VTOAI perspective, and also from the perspective of 
some XML parsers. instead, try 1000-1500 records. remember also there 
are some potential service providers like me down here in South Africa 
who would almost never be able to get a 30MB chunk at most times of the 
day over our network :)

lastly, fwiw, FastCGI won't help for this problem. but if you want to 
try a really obscure solution, the code has an internal representation 
of a record that you might try replacing with a pointer of some sort. 
that way you don't simultaneously store lots of records in memory but 
you still have enough info to generate the record in XML when required.

hope this helps ... if you want more details about anything really 
specific, send me a direct email.

Subject: Re: Interoperability - subject classification/terminology

An  example of an indexing service that uses self-assigned
field descriptors is Dissertation Abstracts. Furthermore, it uses a
controlled list: when you submit your thesis you select your field from a
list. It need not match the name of your department.

Anyone who thinks that this provides reliable subject indexing or scanning
should give it a try. Since recent theses have abstracts, it is possible
to perform a decent subject search using free text techniques to the
extent the abstracts are descriptive. But a scanning service based only on
the category would miss most of the work in most subjects.

I fully expect the academics using the new servers to produce a subject
indexing quagmire, which the librarians and information people will then
have to devise access routes for. It's happened before, and we've done
it before. All we can hope for is that they not make things worse by
reinventing  indexing, or recycling inadequate or outdated systems.
We expect nothing better from any group of  academic authors--after all,
we do just as badly with our own publications.
