The detailed work of the Consortium will be carried out through working
groups to define Policy, Requirements, Methods, Standards and Tools for
Internet archiving. By this means projects will be developed and
defined and will ultimately lead to the creation and provision of the
necessary tools to fulfil the vision of universal coverage of internet
archive collections.

Subject: [OAI-general] Kepler Version 1.2 - Sourceforge Release
Message-ID: <OF3E365528.CF24C9E6-ON85256E97.00797842@cs.odu.edu>

The Digital Library Research Group at Old Dominion University is pleased to
release Kepler Version 1.2 as open source software, and is available for
download at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/oaikepler/


The objective of Kepler is to give any user the ability to easily
self-archive publications by means of an "archivelet": a self-contained,
self-installing software system that functions as an Open Archives
Initiative data provider. Kepler archivelets are designed to be easy to
install, use and maintain. Kepler is a perfect solution for those that need
to be OAI-PMH compliant, but do not have the resources for more complex
OAI-PMH software installations. Some features of Kepler include:

*Configurable community standards
*Tailored publication and search services
*Broad and fast dissemination
*Interoperable with other communities

For more information, please visit the Kepler web site:
http://kepler.cs.odu.edu/


This project is supported by NSF Award 205486 and is a joint effort of
various parts of the US Geological Survey (USGS), Old Dominion University
(ODU), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the Open Language Archives
Community (OLAC).
