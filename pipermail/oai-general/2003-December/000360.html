<PRE>Hi all,

We've just completed a reorganization of the OAI data providers at the 
University of Illinois Library, Urbana-Champaign.

We have redirected our old providers at:

  <A HREF="http://bolder.grainger.uiuc.edu/uiliboaiprovider/2.0/oai.asp">http://bolder.grainger.uiuc.edu/uiliboaiprovider/2.0/oai.asp</A> (2.0)
  <A HREF="http://bolder.grainger.uiuc.edu/uiliboaiprovider/oai.asp">http://bolder.grainger.uiuc.edu/uiliboaiprovider/oai.asp</A> (1.1)

To our new dynamic gateway provider at:

   <A HREF="http://oaigateway.grainger.uiuc.edu/oai.asp">http://oaigateway.grainger.uiuc.edu/oai.asp</A>

We plan to maintain the redirection for the foreseeable future, but anyone 
harvesting from the old baseURLs should eventually begin harvesting from the 
new baseURL.

Unfortunately, as part of the reorganization we had to assign new 
identifiers to all of the records, so the old identifiers starting with 
either 'oai:oai.library.uiuc.edu:' (2.0) or 'oai:uiLib:' (1.1) should be 
considered deleted, and you should perform a complete reharvest from the new 
provider.

The new provider is actually acting as an aggregator/gateway to seven other 
individual OAI providers which are maintained in the UIUC library.  This 
aggregation currently provides ~165,000 records.  Since the aggregation is 
occurring dynamically, directly from the original providers, record 
staleness should not be an issue.  All records include a provenance 
container describing their origin.  Care should be taken to prevent 
duplicate records if harvesting from both the aggregator/gateway and from 
one of the source OAI providers.

Anyone wishing to harvest all records from the UIUC Library should use 
aggregator/gateway baseURL.  However, people wishing to harvest more 
selectively should consider harvesting from one of the individual providers 
described below:

   Wolfram Mathworld - <A HREF="http://nsdl.grainger.uiuc.edu/WolframMathworld/oai.asp">http://nsdl.grainger.uiuc.edu/WolframMathworld/oai.asp</A>	

   Wolfram Functions - <A HREF="http://nsdl.grainger.uiuc.edu/WolframFunctions/oai.asp">http://nsdl.grainger.uiuc.edu/WolframFunctions/oai.asp</A>

   Expect more to be added in the near future...


We also have a static OAI gateway provider at:

<A HREF="http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/gateway/oai.asp/www.acnatsci.org/library/collections/imls/nlg/AcadNatSciStatic.xml">http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/gateway/oai.asp/www.acnatsci.org/library/collections/imls/nlg/AcadNatSciStatic.xml</A>

So far these new providers have passed the various tests we could think of 
such as the Repository Explorer and our own internal validating harvester, 
but if anyone encounters any problems harvesting from us please let us know. 
  Comments about the reorganization in general are also welcome.  Anyone 
interested in the nitty-gritty details can take a look at our internal 
planning document at <A HREF="http://128.174.36.55/oaiprovidersnew.htm">http://128.174.36.55/oaiprovidersnew.htm</A> although it 
doesn't exactly reflect everything we have done.

Kind regards,
	Tom
