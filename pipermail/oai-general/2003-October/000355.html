COLLABORATIVE WORKING IN A DIGITAL LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT at the D-Lib
Competence Center ISTI-CNR, via G. Moruzzi 1, 56124 Pisa, Italy

ERRATA CORRIGE ON DATES: 20-21 November 2003 

<A HREF="http://dlibcenter.iei.pi.cnr.it">http://dlibcenter.iei.pi.cnr.it</A> 

This is the announcement of a course on Collabortive Digital Libraries
environments.  The course, which will take place in Pisa on November
20-21, 2003 (1 + 1/2 day), is organized in the context of the Digital
Library Competence Center (IST-2001-32587), a project funded within the
FP5 of the European Community. The competence center aims at providing
specific user communities with access to advanced DL tesbeds, services,
expertise and knowledge.

Courses at the Digital Library Competence Center are addressed to
librarians, archivists, scholars and technicians, and offer direct
experience of advanced digital library testbeds. Courses are free of
charge. Registration is requested, maximum number of participants for
each course is 10.

COLLABORATIVE WORKING IN A DIGITAL LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT

The aim is to provide a theoretical and experimental background on the
methods for organizing collaborative work among people accessing
remotely to heterogeneous, multidisciplinary digital archives.

The course is centred on the CYCLADES system
(<A HREF="http://www.ercim.org/cyclades">http://www.ercim.org/cyclades</A>), which combines several technologies
from the Information Retrieval and Digital Library area, where users and
user communities deal with digital archives. CYCLADES provides a highly
personalized environment where users may organize (and search into) the
information space according to their individual taste and use, and, more
important, it also provides advanced features of collaborative work
among the users. It is up to the system to discover interesting
properties about the users' interests, the relationship between users
and user communities, as well as meaningful events that happen in user
shared workspaces, and finally to notify the involved users according to
their own preferences.

The course will teach the techniques and methodologies so that
institutions, user communities, groups of people, projects, etc. may
acquire the skill required to profitably use such advanced systems.

System documentation will be available
