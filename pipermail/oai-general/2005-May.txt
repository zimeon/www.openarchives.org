Subject: [OAI-general] Release of OAI rights specification
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0505032059130.22530@dhcp103-124.cs.cornell.edu>


We are pleased to announce the release of guidelines for conveying rights
expressions about metadata in the OAI-PMH framework:
  http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-rights.htm

The guidelines specify a mechanism for including rights expressions that
pertain to the contents of the <metadata> parts of records in OAI-PMH
responses. No new rights expression language has been created. Instead,
the specification provides a mechanism to include existing and future XML
rights expressions. Description of rights expressions associated with set
and repository aggregations is supported through manifests of rights
expressions in set and repository descriptions. The design has been guided
by the need for simple and clear semantics that will allow
service-providers to make harvesting and use decisions based on these
rights expressions.

The guidelines were developed by the OAI-rights effort initiated in
collaboration with project RoMEO, and have benefited from the broad
experience of a number of contributors:

    Gutteridge wins award for Eprints software   

    Christopher Gutteridge has won the 2005 UKUUG Open Source Award
    http://www.ukuug.org/pr/osa2005.shtml 
    for his work on GNU Eprints
    http://software.eprints.org/ 
    the open-source software for open-access
    archives and repositories. From the University 
    of Southampton press release: 
    http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/737 
    'UKUUG (UK Unix and Open Systems User Group) has made its 2005 Award
    to Christopher Gutteridge of the School of Electronics and Computer
    Science, University of Southampton, for his work on the Open Archive
    Software: GNU EPrints. Christopher, who has been a systems programmer
    and web developer since 1997, has been developing and supporting
    GNU EPrints 2 package over the last four years. The package is
    now used worldwide in universities and research institutions to
    enable researchers to share their research effectively, via the
    web, and to provide accessibility to scientific findings. "EPrints
    is both a practical tool and the crystallization of a philosophy,"
    said Christopher. "It enables research to be accessible to all, and
    provides the foundation for all academic institutions to create their
    own research repositories." The School of Electronics and Computer
    Science has been one of the prime movers in the global movement
    towards open access... The University of Southampton is the
    first UK university to announce that it would be establishing its
    own institutional repository and requiring all its academic staff
    to self-archive their research.' Congratulations, Christopher!

Message-ID: <007b01c565fe$7a8c97e0$2392268a@ulpcpj>

*Apologies for cross posting*

Distributed Services Workshop
14-15 July 2005
Warwick, UK

REGISTRATION NOW OPEN
 
UKOLN's work on the JISC Information Environment Service Registry, the
NISO Metasearch Initiative and the Dublin Core Collection Description
Working Group convinces us that 'service registries' (i.e. databases of
descriptions of available collections and services) will be a critical
part of the infrastructure for deploying service-oriented architectures
and that a distributed approach is likely to be required in order that
such services can operate successfully at a national or international
scale.

The aim of the workshop is to:
 
Share knowledge of current approaches in the area of service registries
Consider the policies, IPR and data ownership issues, metadata schema(s)
and protocol(s) necessary to achieve global interoperability of
distributed DL service registries  
Agree future work, funding sources and partnerships in this area. 

Audience

We would like the audience to include a mix of technical and management
staff, practitioners and policy makers from library, eScience/Grid,
research, learning and other backgrounds.
