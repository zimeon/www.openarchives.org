Subject: [OAI-general] DLF MODS Implementation Guidelines available for
 public comment and review
Message-ID: <6.2.3.4.2.20051207140702.02821540@express.cites.uiuc.edu>

Please excuse the cross-posting.

The Digital Library Federation?s Aquifer 
Initiative is pleased to invite public review and 
comment on the DLF MODS Implementation Guidelines 
for Cultural Heritage Materials.

The primary goal of the Digital Library 
Federation?s Aquifer Initiative is to enable 
distributed content to be used effectively by 
libraries and scholars for teaching, learning, 
and research. The provision of rich, shareable 
metadata for this distributed content is an 
important step towards this goal. To this end, 
the Metadata Working Group of the DLF Aquifer 
Initiative has developed a set of implementation 
guidelines for the Metadata Object Description 
Schema (MODS). These guidelines are meant 
specifically for metadata records that are to be 
shared (whether by the Open Archives Initiative 
Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI PMH) or 
other means) and that describe digital cultural 
heritage and humanities-based scholarly 
resources. The Guidelines are available at 
<http://www.diglib.org/aquifer/DLF_MODS_ImpGuidelines_ver4.pdf>http://www.diglib.org/aquifer/DLF_MODS_ImpGuidelines_ver4.pdf 
(pdf document about 470 kb).

In order to ensure the Implementation Guidelines 
are useful and coherent, we are collecting 
comments and feedback from the wider digital 
library community. We appreciate any and all 
comments, feedback, and questions. These may be 
sent to 
DLF-MODS-GUIDELINES-COMMENTS-L@LISTSERV.INDIANA.EDU. 
The deadline for comments and review is January 20, 2006.
