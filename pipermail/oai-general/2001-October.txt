Subject: [OAI-general] Chemistry Preprint Server is compliant with the Open Archives Ini
 tiative
Message-ID: <54A600C436EA694581B93E4BD4D4788A01D6517E@elslonexc004.wins.epress.co.uk>

I am very pleased to announce that the Chemistry Preprint Server (CPS) -
http://preprint.chemweb.com - is now compliant with version 1.1 of the Open
Archives Initiative (OAI) protocol. Registration details may be viewed on
the OAI site - http://www.openarchives.org/Register/BrowseSites.pl.

It has been a high priority to achieve compliance with the OAI because
ChemWeb has continually developed the CPS as a service for the worldwide
chemical community.

We would of course welcome any feedback or comments on the service.

Best regards,

James Weeks
