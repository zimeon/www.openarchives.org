FEDORA COMMONS AWARDED $4.9M GRANT TO DEVELOP OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE FOR
BUILDING COLLABORATIVE INFORMATION COMMUNITIES

(Ithaca, New York, August 10, 2007) - Fedora Commons today announced the
award of a four year, $4.9M grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
to develop the organizational and technical frameworks necessary to effect
revolutionary change in how scientists, scholars, museums, libraries, and
educators collaborate to produce, share, and preserve their digital
intellectual creations.  Fedora Commons is a new non-profit organization that
will continue the mission of the Fedora Project, the successful open-source
software collaboration between Cornell University and the University of
Virginia.  The Fedora Project evolved from the Flexible Extensible Digital
Object Repository Architecture (Fedora) developed by researchers at Cornell
Computing and Information Science. 


With this funding, Fedora Commons will foster an open community to support
the development and deployment of open source software, which facilitates
open collaboration and open access to scholarly, scientific, cultural, and
educational materials in digital form.  The software platform developed by
Fedora Commons with Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation funding will support a
networked model of intellectual activity, whereby scientists, scholars,
teachers, and students will use the Internet to collaboratively create new
ideas, and build on, annotate, and refine the ideas of their colleagues
worldwide.  With its roots in the Fedora open-source repository system,
developed since 2001 with support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the
new software will continue to focus on the integrity and longevity of the
intellectual products that underlie this new form of knowledge work.  The
result will be an open source software platform that both enables
collaborative models of information creation and sharing, and provides
sustainable repositories to secure the digital materials that constitute our
intellectual, scientific, and cultural history. 

Recognizing the importance of multiple participants in the development of new
technologies to support this vision, the Moore Foundation funding will also
support the growth and diversification of the Fedora Community, a global set
of partners who will cooperate in software development, application
deployment, and community outreach for Fedora Commons.  This network of
partners will be instrumental for making Fedora Commons a self-sustainable
non-profit organization that will support and incubate open-source software
projects that focus on new mechanisms for information formation, access,
collaboration, and preservation.

According to Sandy Payette, Executive Director of Fedora Commons, "the new
Fedora Commons can foster technologies and partnerships that make it possible
for academic and scientific communities to publish, share, and archive the
results of their own work in a free, open fashion, and make it possible to
analyze and use content in novel ways."

"Establishing a sustainable open-source software system that provides the
basic infrastructure for on-line communities of scholars will have enduring
impact.  The unanticipated cross-disciplinary uses of this open platform are
the hallmark of this revolutionary infrastructure," said Jim Omura,
technology strategist with the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

Payette also noted, "The open-source software that is developed and
distributed by Fedora Commons can impact the entire lifecycle of what is
often referred to as "e-Research" and "e-Science," including storage of
experimental data, analysis of experimental results, peer review, publication
of findings, and the reuse of published material for the next generation of
scholarly works.  We will also continue our work with libraries and museums
to facilitate the sharing of digitized collections, making previously locked
away material available to wide audiences.  Also, building on our attention
to digital preservation in the Fedora open-source repository system, Fedora
Commons will continue to stress the importance of the sustainability of
digital information in applications of our work."


About Fedora Commons

Fedora Commons <http://www.fedora-commons.org>  is a non-profit organization
whose purpose is to provide sustainable open-source technologies to help
individuals and organizations create, manage, publish, share, and preserve
digital content upon which we form our intellectual, scientific, and cultural
heritage.  Since 2001, with support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation,
Cornell University and the University of Virginia have collaborated on the
Fedora Project which has developed, distributed, and supported innovative
open-source repository software that combines content management, web
services, and semantic technologies.  The Fedora software has been adopted
worldwide to support an array of applications including open-access
publishing, scholarly communication, digital libraries, e-science, archives,
and education.

Fedora Commons will initially be located in the Information Science Building
at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.  The Executive Director of Fedora
Commons is Sandy Payette, who co-invented the Fedora architecture and led the
Cornell arm of the open-source Fedora Project.  The Board of Directors of
Fedora Commons provides leadership from multiple communities, including
open-access publishing, digital libraries, sciences, and humanities.  For

Subject: [OAI-general] DLF Aquifer MODS Guidelines FAQ and MARCXML to MODS
	stylesheet
Message-ID: <0E34DA4C7FFF7A459DFCEE208B739D2B01A3842D@iu-mssg-mbx101.ads.iu.edu>

This announcement is being sent to multiple lists; please excuse any
duplication.

The DLF Aquifer Metadata Working Group is happy to announce the 
availability of two new resources aimed at helping Aquifer participants
prepare metadata for aggregation.

1) An FAQ for institutions implementing the DLF/Aquifer Implementation
Guidelines for Shareable MODS Records. 

<http://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence/x/MYAH>

The FAQ is designed to supplement the DLF/Aquifer Implementation
Guidelines for Shareable MODS Records
<http://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence/download/attachments/28330/DLFM
ODS_ImplementationGuidelines_Version1.pdf> and MODS Guidelines Levels of
Adoption
<http://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence//x/q24>, to help institutions
understand the rationale behind the metadata guidelines designed by the
Aquifer project. The Aquifer Metadata Working Group plans to add to this
FAQ over time. Please do not hesitate to contact any Working Group
member <http://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence/x/Sm8> with suggestions.


2) The DLF Aquifer MARCXML to MODS XSL Stylesheet, version 2007-08-10.

<http://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence//x/K4AQ>

The Aquifer stylesheet for record conversion is based on the MARCXML to
MODS stylesheet for
MODS version 3.2 made available by the Library of Congress on the MODS
website <http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/MARC21slim2MODS.xsl>, and
is based on a version incorporating LC's revisions up to number 1.15.
We are grateful to the Library of Congress for providing and maintaining
this document and for their help in preparing our version.

Our goal in making this version available is to make it easier for
institutions having digital content they wish to contribute metadata to
the DLF Aquifer project, American Social History Online.  For
institutions with MARC records, the stylesheet may help to convert their
metadata to MODS records in a way that we believe better meets the
requirements and recommendations of the Aquifer Guidelines.  Our changes
address the needs of the Aquifer project, specifically the requirements
and recommendations of the Aquifer Implementation Guidelines for
Shareable MODS Records, but may be useful to consider for other
aggregators who are mapping MARCXML to MODS or other formats for OAI
sharing.

More information about these changes can be found in an Introduction
<http://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence//x/MYAQ>, comments on specific
changes at the beginning of the stylesheet, and the "Mapping" "MARC to
MODS" section of the Aquifer FAQ page mentioned above.  The latter
document will be updated as new questions are answered.

Please note that content standards and practices using MARC vary between
institutions, and sometimes within an institution over time or between
types of collections or materials.  No one stylesheet can deal
appropriately with all variations in the use of MARC.  The mapping
decisions underlying the changes we have made, as well as the decisions
underlying the LC stylesheet (documented at
<http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/mods-mapping.html>), should be
studied by an institution and tested on sample records to determine
whether the results are as desired or whether the institution needs to
modify the stylesheet for a particular collection of records.

Questions about the stylesheet may be addressed to any Metadata Working
Group member; addresses can be found in the Roster of members
<http://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence/x/Sm8>.  The members of the
MARC to MODS subcommittee were Laura Akerman, John Chapman and Tracy
Meehleib.
