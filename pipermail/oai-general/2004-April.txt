DDQ 3(1) is available at http://home.pacbell.net/hgladney/ddq_3_1.htm

This DIGITAL DOCUMENT QUARTERLY number begins a discussion of preserving
office records—a topic that requires different emphases than preserving
cultural and scientific documents.  It also examines one manifestation of
the puzzlement some authors indicate about digital preservation—puzzlement
that partly comes from inattention to obvious social and economic facts.  It
continues with several topics that I find amusing, and resumes the
technology price watch that was omitted in DDQ 2(4).

The DDQ 3(1) table of contents lists:
	Preserving Office Records
	Pessimism and Irony about Digital Preservation
	Research Recommendation: Preservation Media as Durable as Paper
	Progress in Digital Preservation Services: Open Archives, File Formations,
Images
	Epistemology and Software: Gödel’s Proof that God Exists, SW Aphorisms
	News: Challengers to MS Office, A Ridiculous Patent Application by
Microsoft
	Innovations: Eclipse IDE, Web Pages with See-Through Portions
	Reading Recommendations: Ambrose Bierce, Peter Drucker, Lou Gerstner
	Practical Matters: Spam, Identity Theft, Home Computing Price Watch

Best wishes, Henry

mod_oai Project Aims at Optimizing Web Crawling

For immediate release April 21, 2004

Norfolk VA & Los Alamos NM - The Computer Science Department of Old
Dominion University and the Research Library of the Los Alamos
National Laboratory announce the launch of the "mod_oai" project.
The aim of the project is to create the mod_oai Apache software
module that will expose content accessible from Apache Web servers
via the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
(OAI-PMH).  The mod_oai project is generously funded by the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation.

Apache is an open-source Web server that is used by 63% - approximately
27 million - of the Websites in the world.  The OAI-PMH is a protocol
to selectively harvest from data repositories.  The protocol has
had a considerable impact in the field of digital libraries but it
has yet to be embraced by the general Web community.  The mod_oai
project hopes to achieve such broader acceptance by making the
power and efficiency of the OAI-PMH available to Web servers and
Web crawlers.  For example, the planned OAI-PMH interface to Apache
Web servers should allow responding to requests to collect all
files added or changed since a specified date, or all files that
are of a specified MIME-type.

The Apache Web server defines an extensible module format that
allows specific functionality to be incorporated directly into the
Web server.  The mod_oai project will build such an Apache module
that is able to respond to OAI-PMH requests pertaining to files
made accessible by the Apache server. The mod_oai module will be
developed under the GNU Public License (GPL) and distributed through
sourceforge.net upon completion.

Contact: Michael Nelson <mln@cs.odu.edu> and Herbert Van de Sompel

Subject: [OAI-general] Please Register All OA Institutional Archives
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10404222147530.24606-100000@pandora>

         *Apologies for cross-posting*

Tim Brody has created a Registry of Institutional OA Archives that
lists the known archives by Country, Type, and Software (Eprints,
Dspace, or other), harvested from celestial.

    http://archives.eprints.org/eprints.php?action=browse

It also displays the all-important graph of the number of items in each
archive, and tracks the growth of each archive across time.

But there are more OA Archives out there! 
Please register yours, or any you know of at:

    http://archives.eprints.org/eprints.php?action=add

Graphs charting the growth of total number of archives and total number
of archive items are also available:

    http://archives.eprints.org/eprints.php?action=analysis

If you want your archive counted, please register it!

All 146 registered archives can be viewed, or they can be browsed by
Country, Archive Type, or Archive Software. 

(Note that the category "Undefined" among countries -- with 59 archives
in it! -- occurs because these archives were harvested before the Registry
was created, and the country data was not explicit. These 59 archives
will be hand-reclassified. All new archives will have the country tag
at registration.)

Subject: [OAI-general] OAI Static Repository Specfication released
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0404231140010.18053@dhcp103-124.cs.cornell.edu>

We are pleased to announce the release of the OAI Static Repository and
Static Repository Gateway Specification:
  http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm

The OAI Static Repository provides a simple approach for exposing
relatively static and small collections of metadata records through the
OAI-PMH, without the complexity of implementing an OAI-PMH server. A
Static Repository is an XML file containing metadata records and
repository information that is made accessible at a persistent HTTP URL. A
Static Repository Gateway provides intermediation for one or more Static
Repositories by responding to OAI-PMH requests using data from the Static
Repositories.

To coincide with the release of this specification, the Los Alamos
National Laboratory Research Library announces an update of their Static
Repository Gateway software. The gateway software is available from
SourceForge:
  http://srepod.sourceforge.net/
