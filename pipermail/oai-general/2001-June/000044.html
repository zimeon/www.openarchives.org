                CALL FOR PAPERS AND PARTICIPATION


                            DC-2001

              International Conference on Dublin Core 
                  and Metadata Applications 2001

                   <A HREF="http://www.nii.ac.jp/dc2001/">http://www.nii.ac.jp/dc2001/</A>

Date:       22 - 26 October 2001
Venue:      National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan
Sponsors:   National Institute of Informatics (NII, <A HREF="http://www.nii.ac.jp/">http://www.nii.ac.jp/</A>)
            Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI, <A HREF="http://dublincore.org/">http://dublincore.org/</A>)
            Japan Science and Technology Corporation 
            (JST, <A HREF="http://www.jst.go.jp/EN/">http://www.jst.go.jp/EN/</A>)

Providing machine-understandable data on the Web has become a priority
not just for publishers and scientific communities, but for a wide
range of commercial ventures and services.  Resource discovery across a
diversity of services on the emerging Semantic Web is facilitated by
the use of shared metadata vocabularies such as the Dublin Core
Metadata Element Set.

The Dublin Core workshop series has provided a forum for international,
cross-disciplinary metadata development since 1995.  DC-2001, ninth in
this series, will include an international conference for the broader
metadata community with three principal missions:

-- to provide a forum to discuss further development of the Dublin Core
   and related metadata standards

-- to provide a forum to present and exchange new ideas about metadata
   and applications, not limited to Dublin Core, and

-- to provide tutorials on the creation, management, and use of
   metadata applications.

DC-2001 is the first event in the DC Workshop series to be hosted in
Asia and is also the first event to include conference and tutorial
tracks in addition to the workshop.

The Conference track of DC-2001 (Wednesday-Friday, 24-26 October)
invites submissions of papers in the following areas:

-- Conceptual models for metadata
-- Implementation of systems and tools for metadata applications
-- Surveys and case studies of metadata applications
-- Novel activities based on metadata
-- Interoperability among metadata systems
-- Relationships among various metadata standards

The Workshop track (Monday-Wednesday, 22-24 October), will feature
technical meetings of ongoing working groups of the Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative.  The agenda for the workshop track is under
development in DCMI Working Groups.  All active members of working
groups, and others who would like to become active, are invited to
participate.
