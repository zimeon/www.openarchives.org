<PRE>&gt;<i>as this
</I>&gt;<i>Registry grows, it may well be necessary to add a certification
</I>&gt;<i>component to it (lest porn-sites and weight-loss sites decide OAI
</I>&gt;<i>compliance is another way to spam more people).
</I>
Yes, this is the point. Users don't really care what format for meta-data a 
site is compliant with, but want some validation that the materials there 
are &quot;peer reviewed&quot;.

&gt;<i>But for now, OAI's main objective is to get the preprints and
</I>&gt;<i>postprints of refereed research up there, archived in OAI-compliant
</I>&gt;<i>archives.
</I>
It seems that from the point of view of a Google user, it doesn't matter 
whether they are compliant to your format or not, since Google will do its 
ordinary search.

&gt;<i>But what OAI will (I hope) never get involved in is the refereeing
</I>&gt;<i>itself. That is not part of the function of providing
</I>&gt;<i>interoperability. It is for the peer-reviewed journals and
</I>&gt;<i>conferences, etc., to do the peer-reviewing and &quot;certification&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i>that sense. OAI just provides the tagging scheme.
</I>
But it is the filtering that matters to users, not the tagging.

&gt;<i>I agree completely. First, a &quot;scholarly/scientific google&quot; would be the
</I>&gt;<i>way to go (let's not leave out the nonscientific fields of
</I>&gt;<i>research!),
</I>
I agree

&gt;<i>and even there, it would not consist only of the pre- and
</I>&gt;<i>post-refereeing journal articles (but also books, etc., which may be
</I>&gt;<i>neither full-text nor free nor OAI-compliant).
</I>
What is the difference between &quot;pre-refereeing&quot; and &quot;anything you want to 
stick on the web and claim it is being sent somewhere&quot;?  I was assuming 
here that the point of having a special category was to have the effect of 
refereeing so you could trust the material more. I can't trust something 
because someone just says it is &quot;pre-referee&quot; and puts it on some site that 
uses some format.
