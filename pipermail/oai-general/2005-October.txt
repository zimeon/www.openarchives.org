  Registration for the next CERN workshop on Innovations in Scholarly
  Communication (OAI4) closes on Friday 14 October at midnight local
  time. It is not possible to admit late registrations beyond that
  moment because of security restrictions at the site. So if you have
  not registered and want to participate, I suggest you do so immediately.

Dear All:

If you have an institutional repository, please register it at:
http://archives.eprints.org/eprints.php?action=add

Then the growth of your archive will be automatically monitored and
available for comparative statistics. (See the various displays avaliable
in the Registry.) And everyone will have a clear idea of how the number
of IRs as well as the number of items in them is growing.

And if your institution has an official self-archiving policy, please
register it at:
http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/sign.php

Then other institutions can follow your example.

Many thanks,

Stevan Harnad

ELPUB 2006: Digital Spectrum: Integrating Technology and Culture
10th International Conference on Electronic Publishing
14 to 16 June 2006, Bansko (Bulgaria)



Submission deadline: November 21st 2005


http://www.elpub.net <elpub2006@elpub.net>


The ELPUB 2006 conference will keep the tradition of the nine previous international conferences on electronic publishing, held in the United Kingdom (in 1997 and 2001), Hungary (1998), Sweden (1999), Russia (2000), the Czech Republic (2002), Portugal (2003), Brazil (2004) and Belgium (2005), which is to bring together researchers, lecturers, librarians, developers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, managers, users and all those interested on issues regarding electronic publishing in widely differing contexts. These include the human, cultural, economic, social, technological, legal, commercial and other relevant aspects that such an exciting theme encompasses.

Three distinguished features of this conference are: broad scope of topics which creates a unique atmosphere of active exchange and learning about various aspects of electronic publishing; combination of general and technical tracks; and a condensed procedure of submission, revision and publication of proceedings which guarantees presentations of most recent work.

ELPUB 2006 offers a variety of activities, such as workshops, tutorials, panel debates etc. Thus, the conference attendees will benefit from:
 - The communication of scientific papers specially prepared for the conference; all papers are to be reviewed and accepted by the international ELPUB Programme Committee;
 - Workshops and tutorials that aim to provide opportunity for attendants to update themselves in topics of high interest within this community of experts;
 - Plenary sessions that aim to summarise the main ideas presented and discussed during the presentation of the conference papers;
 - Panel debates on selected topics; possible topics include news item publishing or new methods, including Open Access, for publishing scientific literature;
 - Demonstration sessions and presentation of posters.

 The ELPUB 2006 keynote will be presented by Dan Matei. He is a professional programmer (specialised in information retrieval) and director of CIMEC - Institute for Cultural Memory in Bucharest. His interests in data models for libraries and museums, cataloguing, digital libraries, taxonomies, surrealism, post-minimalist music are well-known will be reflected in the keynote adress: "Worldwide 'communitarian' online publishing: An exercise in wishful thinking".

ELPUB 2006 invites contributions for papers, tutorials, workshops, posters and demonstrations on the following topics:

* Digital libraries for different user communities
*       Interactive TV
* Electronic publishing for impaired users
*       Security, privacy and copyright issues
* Digital preservation and access
*        Electronic publishing in eLearning applications
*        Economic dimensions of electronic publishing


TECHNICAL TRACK

*    XML applications
*       Metadata encoding process (OAI-PMH, RDF, etc.)
* Open source tools
*      Content search, analysis and retrieval
* Interoperability and scalability
*       Textual and graphical information sources (SVG)
*        Ontologies and classification
*  Electronic publishing for mobile services
*      Security, preservation, quality assurance
*      Recommendations, guidelines, standards


Please, note that the list of topics is not exhaustive. Therefore, submissions on any topic within the overall conference theme will be considered.

 - Tutorial (abstract max of 1500 words)
 - Workshop (abstract max of 1500 words)
 - Poster (abstract max of 500 words)
 - Demonstration (abstract max of 500 words)

Deadlines for submission in all categories: November 21st 2005

Abstracts must be submitted following the instructions on the conference website (http://www.elpub.net). The Programme Committee will notify the authors of the acceptance of submitted papers by January 15, 2006. Authors then will have to submit their full papers by March 1st, 2006, following specific instructions. The conference proceedings will be published as a book by the International Journal 'Information Theories and Applications'. Selected papers will be published in the journal. Posters (total surface app. 1m2) and demonstration materials must be brought by their authors at the conference time and only abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings. Workshops and tutorials proposals will be discussed with submitters in due course.

Specialists from Albania, Belorus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYROM, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro, and Ukraine who are interested to attend the conference are encouraged to send a note to Milena Dobreva (dobreva@math.bas.bg). The organisers are applying for grants for participants from the listed countries.

Hi all,

Long time lurker, first time poster.

We are working on an initiative in Afghanistan called Afghan eQuality
Alliances. The goal of this initiative (working with USAID and other
funding sources) is to restore and develop the Kabul University to be
competitive and effective in the 21st century. We are tasked with
developing core competencies that each 'department' or 'faculty' will
complete. One of those core competencies is the development of a digital
library relevant for each department. 

I am looking for feedback about various issues that should be addressed
with the participants during an upcoming week long workshop about
digital libraries. 

I have reviewed the http://www.openarchives.org/ site, is there anything
else that we should be focusing on?

Thanks for your time.

Hi!
 
Good to hear from you! Good question!
 
One of the activities related to OAI since its conception is the
Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, NDLTD, see
www.ndltd.org.
 
Your university, and more generally the Alliances, are encouraged to
join NDLTD. It is one of the easiest ways to engage a large segment of
university populations (faculty, graduate students, researchers, and
those in support positions throughout the administration and IT
community and library) in digital library activities.
 
We use OAI, so that individual universities have some type of
specialized repository (using tailored software, such as ETD-db, the
electronic thesis and dissertation database, or its adaptations into
other languages or settings, such as for the Australasian Digital Thesis
project) or more general software (e.g., DSpace with plugins developed
in UK, Fedora with additional software such as the VITAL system
developed by VTLS, Eprints, etc.). At the state (e.g., efforts by
OhioLink), national (e.g., activities in Brazil connected with IBICT),
and regional (e.g., the ADT effort mentioned above) levels, OAI also is
used.  Then, at the global level, OCLC runs our Union Catalog using OAI
(see http://alcme.oclc.org/ndltd/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=ListSets and an
SRU service atop that).  On the service provider side, there are a
variety of metadata or full-text based free services that work from the
Union Catalog, run by Scirus (connected with Elsevier), VTLS, CALIS in
China, Virginia Tech, etc.
 
I'd be happy to work with you if this is of interest.  If you are coming
to ICADL 2005, the International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries,
in Bangkok in December, or other events next year, perhaps we can meet
to discuss this further.
 
Hope this helps!  Warm regards, Ed Fox
