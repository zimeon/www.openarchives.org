I have branched this more widely because the question is important:

OPSIS has been funded by JISC/JCEI/DNER (1) to continuously upgrade the
Eprints code, fixing bugs, adding enhancements, and keeping it
compliant with OAI upgrades, (2) to provide support for Universities
adopting it and (3) to open-source the code.

Eprints is funded by JISC/JCEI/DNER for a year as the OPSIS project, but it
is also receiving some support from its sister project, OPCIT (funded by
JISC/Elib as well as NSF for what is now the 3rd of 3 years).

Eprints has been doing very well so far and I don't think it should
have any difficulty in finding further funding. What ensures its
longevity is increasing collective utilisation (and hence commitment)
by the academic community worldwide. This means increasing adoption of
the Eprints software for institutional self-archiving by universities,
in the first instance, but, even more important, the exercise of
systematic and energetic measures by the universities to ensure that
their Eprints archives are filled by their researchers. 

The longevity of Eprints is a legitimate concern. But creating an
ever greater momentum to fill university Eprints archives is an
even more substantive concern, and success in meeting it is the best
way to meet the first concern as well. 

So I would say, yes, let those who have adopted Eprints and are relying
on it already make their voices heard on the importance of sustaining
Eprints, but, even more important, let them put as much concerted
effort as possible into filling their own existing archives, as well as
encouraging the creation of further archives. The very best argument
for funding sustained support is strong evidence of a growing portion
of our intellectual eggs being consigned to this collective basket.
