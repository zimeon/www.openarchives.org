hi

i recently received a request to register one of the IRs/archives i 
manage with OCLC, as OAIster transitions to OCLC.

i am concerned that the terms and conditions cover both metadata AND all 
forms of data ... while OAIster harvested metadata, OCLC appears to want 
to claim more rights associated with digital objects. i believe this 
goes against one of the fundamental principles of the OAI-PMH - that we 
harvest metadata only.

in most institutional repositories this is a minefield of legal 
problems, as the majority of commercial publishers only allow users to 
archive versions in their IRs with specific restrictions, different in 
each case (see RoMEO).

we need to be aware that the rules are changing before we simply click 
on "I agree". personally, until this is resolved "I do not agree" :)

ttfn,
----hussein

Hussein,

I see what you mean - we don't have the legal right to grant OCLC 
these permissions, except perhaps for PD or 
institutionally-copyrighted materials. Much of what we host is by 
non-transferrable permission of copyright holders, so we couldn't 
agree to these terms, either - not as currently written.

Hussein, Peter, all,

OCLC's intent is to do what we did at University of Michigan, harvest the
metadata. It is not the intent to go beyond that to capture the content
itself. OCLC is working with their legal department on this issue.
Unfortunately, that is all I can offer at the moment. I will provide more as
it comes available.

The fact that that's exactly what they say they are going to do we can  
probably pass off as a consequence of having a more pro-active  
marketing department than legal department (thank heavens!)

However, that sort of cast-iron legal guarantee cannot confidently be  
granted to a third party for even the metadata.

A key reason that the OAI-PMH was restricted to metadata was that we
felt we could share metadata without too much legal concern. Even
so, the e-prints schema/guideline was created and is widely used to
express policies for reuse of metadata (and the data it describes):

http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-eprints.htm

It seems that OCLC's rather heavy handed license request flies in the
face of accepted practices within the community. I wonder whether OCLC
will remove all existing content from OAIster until people agree to
the new license? (Hopefully revised to something more rational.)

Cheers,
Simeon

No, I think it was boilerplate. They are working on it.

I will forward that to them.

No, they will not. It is not a requirement to sign that form. My guess is
they will move quickly to change this, but that is only IMO.

On behalf of OCLC,  I'd like to provide some clarification on the
OAIster discussions that have been happening lately.   Please see Roy
Tennant's recent post:


Clarification on OCLC/OAIster Transfer
<http://hangingtogether.org/?p=739> 


September 23rd, 2009 by Roy 

Earlier in the week I posted "The Straight Dope on OAIster"
<http://hangingtogether.org/?p=738>  in an effort to bring the OAI
community up to date on the transition of this service from the
University of Michigan to OCLC, and our intentions for it going forward.
A comment on that post, as well as chatter via Twitter and on some
mailing lists has prompted us to clarify the terms and conditions to
make it absolutely clear that they only apply to the harvested metadata.

It was never our intent to harvest anything other than metadata.
Unfortunately, the terminology used in the OAIster terms and conditions
did not accurately state the rights that OCLC needs to make the OAIster
data available.  As a result, the OAIster terms and conditions have been
corrected and are being re-sent to OAIster data providers. 

We are sorry for causing a misunderstanding. Our intent has always been
to simply transition the good work of the University of Michigan to our
infrastructure and support. We will strive to be more accurate and clear
in the future so as not to distract us all from the important work of
maintaining and expanding access to open access content.

Hussein, Peter, all,

Why is the intent this person claims different from the wording in the
documentation. This is the way that it always starts; google's intent is
not to snap up all of the orphan works out their, but just to make them
available to the publi more easily (while they grab more money). Open
library is a good alternative, but then again OCLC and the few large
corporate publishers will not be making any money from that data.

An alternative to the systematic commercialisation of Open Access data is the
formal constitution of COAR: the Confederation of Open Access Repositories,
scheduled to take place in Open Access Week 2009.

http://www.driver-repository.eu/DRIVER-COAR.html


Emerging as the sustainable outcome of the DRIVER infrastructure, COAR is a
community-driven approach, where institutions can determine how they want
their repositories to be deployed.  The action plan is directed towards
international organisational support for Open Access in research
infrastructures around the globe. 

COAR utilises the tremendous synergies emerging in higher education between
repositories, researchers and research funders to coordinate collaborative
networks in the vision of a global knowledge infrastructure.  

Once the legal and technical infrastructures for OA dissemination reach the
coverage and maturity that satisfies the researcher's data-sharing concerns
and matches the respect that WorldCat enjoys, third party service providers,
such as OCLC offer to OAIster, become equitable partners without questionable
terms and conditions.

Dale

Apart from the fact that "systematic commercialisation" is a bit of an  
exaggeration, can you explain exactly how a repository organisation is  
going to provide "an alternative" service model?  Surely building  
other services is the alternative? Shouldn't there be a "Confederation  
of Open Access Services" ????

Institutions already determine how they want their repositories to be  
deployed. It is true that the majority of them don't publish policies  
for metadata and data reuse (according to data from OpenDOAR), so that  
state of affairs should be improved upon.

I applaud this but it is (according to the website) COAR's *second*  
goal set. Its first goal set is to maintain the DRIVER confederation.  
Does this mean that COAR is a membership club whose first allegiance  
is to its own continued existence? Will membership drives will be the  
first thing on the agenda and where membership marketing and advocacy  
will take priority over OA marketing and advocacy?

You are right of course, services are the key, and shared services are
integral to research infrastructures.  Yet as Boyle points out
"Infrastructure is the thing that we always fail to fund because it's kind of
everybody's problem, and therefore its nobody's problem."  (Nature 461,2009,
p162)

 

Since the membership drive seems to be taking care of itself, COAR will focus
on networking international repository federations, including, but not
limited to the DRIVER infrastructure.  Discussions are underway ahead of the
launch in October on agreements on data sharing, domain or range of data to
be exposed or shared, feasibility planning  and implementation of data
exchange, possible mirroring or replica services, interoperability standards,
etc.

 

The task of building a sustainable business model for OA resources is
enormous, and its urgency is underlined by the  vulnerability of OAIster.

Apart from the fact that "systematic commercialisation" is a bit of an
exaggeration, can you explain exactly how a repository organisation is going
to provide "an alternative" service model?  Surely building other services is
the alternative? Shouldn't there be a "Confederation of Open Access Services"
????

	Emerging as the sustainable outcome of the DRIVER infrastructure,
COAR is a community-driven approach, where institutions can determine how
they want their repositories to be deployed.

Institutions already determine how they want their repositories to be
deployed. It is true that the majority of them don't publish policies for
metadata and data reuse (according to data from OpenDOAR), so that state of
affairs should be improved upon.



The action plan is directed towards international organisational support for
Open Access in research infrastructures around the globe. 

I applaud this but it is (according to the website) COAR's *second* goal set.
Its first goal set is to maintain the DRIVER confederation. Does this mean
that COAR is a membership club whose first allegiance is to its own continued
existence? Will membership drives will be the first thing on the agenda and
where membership marketing and advocacy will take priority over OA marketing
and advocacy?

But that's back to my original point - the OA resources aren't  
threatened by OAIster's change of status. What is underlined is the  
vulnerability of the OA services. I don't know how Kat has been coping  
with OAIster since its launch, but I can tell you that the OAI  
services run by Southampton (ROAR, Celestial and CiteBase) are  
supported mainly by the determination and sweat of Tim Brody (the  
original service creator) and the crumbs that fall from repository  
funding projects.

The emergence of information services of a global scale (think Google  
and Google Scholar) highlights the need to have some serious  
infrastructure at your disposal! We have been lucky enough to have  
some funding from JISC to transform ROAR into a more sustainable form,  
but we'd really like to have some shared infrastructure for sharing  
celestial's OAI data to allow new services to be easily grown. Perhaps  
a cloud solution, and perhaps we can talk to COAR about it!

  I am not sure if an API is sufficent. I'd like to have a copy of the
  source data as well as of the data and scripts that are used to
  produce the output data. Anybody who will join my line of work 
  will get these via rsync.

  There is discussion, not much on the American Scientist Open Access
  Forum. I am aware of

http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-general/2009-September/thread.html
https://arl.org/Lists/SPARC-IR/

  but there may be others. 

  In general, an "OAI-PHM data users", polite for "OAI-PMH data
  exegetes" list is probably a good idea. I'd be happy to run it, but
  I don't want to be the only member.

This for all purposes give OCLC complete control since they may "change
these Terms at any time in its sole discretion".
