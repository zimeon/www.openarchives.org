EPrints 2.3.7 released.
http://software.eprints.org/

The style of the default archive has been overhauled to be neater and 
make better use of stylesheets. See http://demoprints.eprints.org/ for a 
look at the new style.

This release adds the option to make required file formats depend on the 
type of eprint, rather than have one setting for the entire archive. 
This means that in one archive an eprint about a book may not require 
any formats at all, one about a presentation may require powerpoint, and 
a normal article require PDF.

Version 2.3.0 to 2.3.6 of EPrints required the "libapreq" library, this 
library proved difficult for some users to install, so in response to 
our users comments, from 2.3.7 is no longer used.

Also 2.3.7 sees the addition of a XSLT style sheet to makes human 
readable view of the OAI interface in Internet Explorer or Mozilla 
browsers. eg. http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/perl/oai2?verb=Identify
