You might take a look at Greenstone work by Witten and colleagues in New
Zealand.

Ian H. Witten, David Bainbridge, Stefan J. Boddie, Greenstone: Open-Source
Digital Library Software, D-Lib Magazine 7(10), October 2001

As this is on-going work, if what's published interests you sufficiently to
try it, you might want to inquire for the latest and greatest.

If you do pursue this possibility, would you please share your evaluation
and experiences with me?  Perhaps other OAI subscribers would be interested
also.

Dear all,

The "2nd Workshop on the Open Archives Initiative (OAI): Gaining 
independence with e-prints archives" will be held from Thursday to 
Saturday (17-19 October) at CERN, in Geneva:
http://library.cern.ch/Announcement.htm

The registration was such a success that we were unfortunately not 
able to accept all the people who wanted to attend the workshop. We 
thought that a workshop dedicated to the OAI and some related 
initiatives should also be as open as possible ; that's why we 
decided to "webcast" it. 

Webcasted lectures: 
The webcasted talks will be available only a few minutes after the 
end of each speaker's presentation. To watch a webcasted lecture, you 
will have to go to the workshop agenda: 

http://doc.cern.ch/age?a02333 

A link will appear next to the title of each lecture, as soon as 
available. You will find to kind of files: 
- video files 
- video files synchronized with PowerPoint presentations 

The lectures will be archived and we will keep them linked from the 
workshop agenda. 

Stay in tune. 

Best regards, 

Organizing Committee

Hello,

Am in the process of conducting a survey where in i am
trying to understand the user's approach towards
e-prints. Or rather orientation of users towards such
an endeavor. 

Hence, would like to know, if you are aware of any
survey on the awareness of OAI or eprints has already
been conducted. Please let me know of the same since i
would like to take a look and see what i am missing. 

Thanks

Regards,

Open Access to 

Hidden Resources

 

6-7th December 2002, Lisbon, Portugal

http://www.oaforum.org <http://www.oaforum.org/>  

 

 

(Registration deadline: 1st November 2002)

 

The organizing committee is very pleased to announce the 2nd Open Archives Forum Workshop, which will be held in Lisbon on 6-7 December, 2002. Registration is open on the Open Archives Forum website (http://www.oaforum.org/workshops/).

 

The objective of this workshop is to bring together organizations that work in the archival and library fields in order explore whether, and under what conditions, the open archive approach is viable for these organisations. It also intends to promote the establishment of new collaborative links aimed at building interoperable infrastructures for supporting the dissemination of both archival and library resources. A tutorial on the implementation of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) will be held the afternoon before the workshop for those people who are not familiar with this protocol.

 

The workshop will consist of both presentations given by invited speakers and small groups' breakout sessions where the participants can discuss key issues, such as:

* How far OAI-PMH is applicable to the electronic records of traditional archives, whether historical or "born digital";

* To what extent OAI-PMH and Dublin Core have been tried out and accepted in the library community;

* Can OAI-PMH enable innovative ways of cross-domain collaboration between archival and library communities?

* How far OAI-PMH crosses over with other interoperability standards and concepts, such as Z39.50 and web services.

 

Invited speakers include:

 

* Jose' Borbinha (National Library of Portugal)

* Goran Kristiansson (The Regional Archives in Lund)

* Carl Lagoze (Cornell University) 

* George Mackenzie (National Archives of Scotland)

* Mark Bide (Rightscom)

 


Who should attend


 

* archivists and librarians who are considering opening their

repositories of information;

* technical, research and project managers who are interested in providing services on interoperable open archives and libraries

* decision makers in the area of libraries and archives looking for new strategic opportunities to promote their organizations and working areas

About Open Archives Forum.

The Open Archives Forum provides a Europe-based focus for dissemination of information about European activity related to open archives and, in particular, to the Open Archives Initiative. The aim of the Forum is to facilitate clustering of IST projects, national initiatives and other parties interested in the open archives approach. In order to do so, OA-Forum brings interested parties together to build a community of interest, enable exchange of information and establish a web-based European information source for open archives. In addition, OA-Forum undertakes comparative reviews of technical and organisational issues. OA-Forum is funded as an accompanying measure within the Information Societies Technology (IST) Programme, a theme of the European Union's Fifth Framework Programme managed by the Information Society Directorate-General of the European Commission. The partners of OAF are: University of Bath-UKOLN (United Kingdom), Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie della Informazione -CNR (Italy) and Computing Center of Humboldt University (Germany).

***********************************************************
 GNU EPRINTS Version 2.2 Released       31st October 2002
***********************************************************

GNU EPrints 2.2 Released.

EPrints 2 is free software which creates web based
archives, containing documents and metadata.

Major Changes

*       Added option to have "subject editors" who may only
        edit certain eprints, ie. all in one subject, or
        only books & posters.

*       Added support for XML::GDOME which is a faster XML
        module, but does require some more software. This
        is strongly recommended for non-demo systems as
        it's faster and uses less memory.

For all new features in 2.2 please see:
 http://software.eprints.org/newfeatures.php

For more infomation on the software see:
 http://software.eprints.org/

For more infomation on the project see:
 http://www.eprints.org/

For a demo see:
 http://demoprints.eprints.org/
