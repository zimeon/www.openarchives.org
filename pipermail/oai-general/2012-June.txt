Message-ID: <4FE8D9C4.3050002@cornell.edu>

Dear oai-general members,

The oai-general list will be migrated to the "OAI-announce" group on
Google groups:

https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oai-announce

All subscriptions set to receive email (plain or digest) will be
migrated to the Google group. The historical list archive will remain 
available on the OAI website at
http://www.openarchives.org/pipermail/oai-general/

Cheers,
Simeon
