Subject: [OAI-general] Specification for an OAI Static Repository and an OAI Static Repository Gateway
Message-ID: <B1D41F4ABBC45949BC3539F5831D4425301EDB@EXCHVS2.cs.cornell.edu>

Apologies for duplication:

The Open Archives Initiative announces the beta release of the
Specification for an OAI Static Repository and an OAI Static Repository
Gateway. A Static Repository provides a simple approach for exposing
relatively static and small collections of metadata records through the
OAI-PMH.

This beta release follows a period of alpha testing during which
implementations were written to the specification and functional details
addressed. Public comment is invited during this beta period.  

The full press release is available at:
http://www.openarchives.org/news/oaistaticrepo031010.html 

The specification is available at:
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm 

An accompanying XML Schema for Gateway Descriptions is available at:

COLLABORATIVE WORKING IN A DIGITAL LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT at the D-Lib
Competence Center ISTI-CNR, via G. Moruzzi 1, 56124 Pisa, Italy

ERRATA CORRIGE ON DATES: 20-21 November 2003 

http://dlibcenter.iei.pi.cnr.it 

This is the announcement of a course on Collabortive Digital Libraries
environments.  The course, which will take place in Pisa on November
20-21, 2003 (1 + 1/2 day), is organized in the context of the Digital
Library Competence Center (IST-2001-32587), a project funded within the
FP5 of the European Community. The competence center aims at providing
specific user communities with access to advanced DL tesbeds, services,
expertise and knowledge.

Courses at the Digital Library Competence Center are addressed to
librarians, archivists, scholars and technicians, and offer direct
experience of advanced digital library testbeds. Courses are free of
charge. Registration is requested, maximum number of participants for
each course is 10.

COLLABORATIVE WORKING IN A DIGITAL LIBRARY ENVIRONMENT

The aim is to provide a theoretical and experimental background on the
methods for organizing collaborative work among people accessing
remotely to heterogeneous, multidisciplinary digital archives.

The course is centred on the CYCLADES system
(http://www.ercim.org/cyclades), which combines several technologies
from the Information Retrieval and Digital Library area, where users and
user communities deal with digital archives. CYCLADES provides a highly
personalized environment where users may organize (and search into) the
information space according to their individual taste and use, and, more
important, it also provides advanced features of collaborative work
among the users. It is up to the system to discover interesting
properties about the users' interests, the relationship between users
and user communities, as well as meaningful events that happen in user
shared workspaces, and finally to notify the involved users according to
their own preferences.

The course will teach the techniques and methodologies so that
institutions, user communities, groups of people, projects, etc. may
acquire the skill required to profitably use such advanced systems.

System documentation will be available

Subject: [OAI-general] Open Archives Forum Tutorial on the OAI PMH
Message-ID: <019001c39a45$e8de75a0$4992268a@ulpcpjh>

The Open Archives Forum has created an online tutorial for the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. It can be found at:

http://www.oaforum.org/tutorial/

This OAI Protocol online tutorial is based on two substantial pre-workshop tutorials the OA-F project ran in 2002-3, during its workshop series in Europe. A number of people contributed to these, including Andy Powell and Pete Cliff of UKOLN, and Uwe Muller of Humboldt University in Berlin. The material was developed to an extent out of materials created by various members of the OAI itself, including Herbert van de Soempel, Michael Nelson, etc. The OA-F has built on the experience of  these live tutorials, and the online version covers most of what potential implementers of the protocol need to know. As well as extensive referencing within the tutorial, it also points to relevant external resources.

Best wishes,

Philip Hunter

Subject: [OAI-general] Third Workshop on the Open Archives Initiative announced
Message-ID: <20031028045339.GA29023@openlib.org>

Announcement [crossposted]

CERN Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication: 
"Implementing the benefits of OAI" 
3rd Workshop on the Open Archives Initiative (OAI3)

LIBER, SPARC and SPARC-Europe, and the CERN Library are organising the
third OAI workshop at CERN, Geneva (Switzerland) on 12-14 February 2004.


Please see further details and book online at 
http://info.web.cern.ch/info/OAIP/ 

The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was founded in 2000 to bring the
benefits of open archives-compliant software to the research community
and launch an international network of institutional repositories. 

Since OAI's founding, there have been many successful applications of
the technology, and a simultaneous, widespread understanding that open
archives technology is the foundation for the future of research. In the
field of scholarly communication there has also been a remarkable
evolution: open access journals have achieved respectability through the
activities of BioMed Central and PLoS and the number of such journals is
rising; scholarly societies are becoming interested in the open access
model, and we have seen some society publishers adopt the open access
model. The foremost granting agencies in the U.S. and the U.K. have both
issued statements supporting open access. 

However, libraries have not yet reaped large benefits from the OAI's
success. 

Through publishers' "big deals," more commercial journal titles than
ever before are accessible, and library budgets are tightly bound to
them in long-term contracts. Library customers are growing accustomed to
the enormous comfort offered by the databases of those publishers and,
as a consequence, switching to alternative models for scientific
communication has become less and less acceptable. We want to change
this. 

The third CERN workshop will bring together librarians and information
specialists, publishers, scientists and university managers who want to
bring the benefits of open archives technology and open access
publishing to libraries. The conference's action-focused agenda will
prioritize initiatives to be undertaken, in order to increase the impact
of OAI on the process of scientific publishing.
