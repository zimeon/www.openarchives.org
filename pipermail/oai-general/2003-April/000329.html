<PRE>The OAI-general list is for information about OAI-related activities.

Lately there have been far too many unsubscribe requests (instead visit
<A HREF="http://oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu/mailman/listinfo/oai-general">http://oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu/mailman/listinfo/oai-general</A> and use the
edit options button), technical/implementation questions (these should go
instead to the oai-implementers list), and off-topic discussion often cc'd
to many lists. Posts will now be moderated for appropriateness in the hope
of improving this list's signal-to-noise ratio. Sadly, this will add a
delay to posting.

Also, a reminder, please keep posts civil (an apology from Seth Whitcher
is included below).

Cheers,
Simeon

Subject: apologies to -

Tim and other forum members

I would like to apologise to Tim Brody and any other forum members for my
insulting email yesterday. It is not in my nature to send these kind of
messages to all and sundry and I can honestly say this was a knee-jerk
reaction to an email from Tim pointing out how to unsubscribe from the
forum which I over-reacted to. My annoyance stemmed from the fact that I
was receiving approximately 5-10 emails a day from people wanting to
unsubscribe from the OAI forum and had previously seen a rude message to a
subscriber, outlining her/his inability to navigate and unsubscribe from
the forum, which I found very irritating. Once again, I would like to
offer my sincerest apologies to those of you who have been affected by
this unfortunate situation.

Yours Sincerely
Seth Whitcher
