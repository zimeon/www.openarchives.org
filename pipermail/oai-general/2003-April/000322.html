NETWORKED KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION SYSTEMS/SOURCES
6TH ANNUAL WORKSHOP
&quot;BUILDING A MEANINGFUL WEB: FROM TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION SYSTEMS=20
TO NEW SEMANTIC TOOLS&quot;

The Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Sources (NKOS) Ad Hoc Working=20
Group (<A HREF="http://nkos.slis.kent.edu">http://nkos.slis.kent.edu</A>) will hold its 6th annual workshop on May 3=
1=20
at the Alice Pratt Brown Hall of Rice University in Houston TX in conjunctio=
n=20
with the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (www.jcdl.org).

This year's workshop, &quot;Building a Meaningful Web,&quot; will focus on the=20
transformation of traditional controlled vocabulary approaches, such as=20
authority lists and thesauri, to new forms of knowledge representation such=20
as ontologies, topic maps, and semantic web components, where relationships=20
between concepts are richer and more extensive and the requirements of=20
computer processing are met. =A0The session will include discussion of the=20
contribution of best practices from more traditional approaches to the desig=
n=20
of new knowledge organization systems.

The goal is to bring these often disparate communities together so that the=20
newer efforts of KOS development can take advantage of the best practices of=
=20
more traditional systems and the standards for traditional KOS structures ca=
n=20
benefit from the technological advances being developed to support improved=20
semantic access to web content. =A0Topics include:

* Best practices of traditional KOS systems and their application to newer=20
semantic forms (ontologies, topic maps, etc.)
* Relevant standards and their status
* Methodologies for transforming legacy KOSs into newer semantic forms
* Development of web services to support the use of KOSs in web-based digita=
l=20
libraries
* Updates on current NKOS projects and applications and related NISO=20
standards activities

The format will consist of invited and volunteered short presentations and=20
plenty of discussion. =A0In addition participants will be given the opportun=
ity=20
to introduce their work and their interests briefly during the workshop=20
introduction.

More detail about the program is available at the NKOS web site at=20

Registration information is available from the JCDL web site (www.jcdl.org).=
=20
=A0Early registration ends on April 25. =A0Discounts are available for IEEE,=
 ACM=20
and ASIST members.
