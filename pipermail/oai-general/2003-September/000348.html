<PRE>Hi

A few months ago, I asked if there was interest for an RSS interface to
my.OAI ( <A HREF="http://www.myoai.com/">http://www.myoai.com/</A> ).

I got very positive feedback from people and (finally) two weeks ago, I
implemented RSS on my.OAI, feel free to check it out. It seems to work well
so far though I have only tried it with Radio UserLand and NetNewsWire.

my.OAI is updated once a week so if you set up an RSS feed from a search,
you will only see changes once a week. If that is an issue for people, I can
switch the update to once a day since I now have the computing power to
support that.

I also asked about SOAP and there was a good suggestion in using SRW for my
SOAP interface:

  <A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/srw/">http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/srw/</A>

But no-one stepped up saying they would actually use such an interface, so I
am leaving it for now. You could also say that I have been slow in providing
the RSS interface, but I have been busy with other projects such as Feedster
( <A HREF="http://www.feedster.com/">http://www.feedster.com/</A> ).

Cheers

Francois
