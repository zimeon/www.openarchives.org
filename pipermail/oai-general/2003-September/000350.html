Position Announcement:

Visiting Project Coordinator and Visiting Assistant Professor of Library 
Administration
University of Illinois Library at Urbana-Champaign

Position Available:

As soon as possible, after closing date of search. A full-time, temporary 
Visiting Faculty position supported by grant funding from the Committee on 
Institutional Cooperation (CIC). Appointment will end May 15, 2006.

Duties and Responsibilities:

This project will be a collaborative effort involving ten CIC member 
libraries. As part of this collaboration, the University of Illinois 
Library at Urbana-Champaign will host an experimental, CIC-wide metadata 
harvesting service based on the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for 
Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). Participating member libraries will make 
metadata available for harvesting and will collectively collaborate on 
testing and assessing the utility and benefit of the service. Focus of the 
University of Illinois Library effort will be on implementing harvesting 
service and a portal for searching aggregated metadata, examining metadata 
authoring practices across the consortium and suggesting best practices for 
metadata authoring in this context, researching features of OAI-PMH of 
special interest in context of academic research library consortiums like 
CIC, and helping to assess potential of OAI-PMH to help CIC member 
libraries share information resources more effectively and efficiently in 
the long term. CIC Digital Library Initiatives Overview Committee 
(CIC-DLIOC) will stay in close touch with project progress, offering 
advice, feedback and suggested direction along the way. (CIC Library 
Directors may designate additional advisory groups to assist in management 
of this project.)

Responsibilities of the position will include (but not be limited to): 1) 
Working with project principal investigator (PI) and research programmer 
(part-time) to extend and develop Library's suite of OAI provider, OAI 
harvesting, and index building applications; 2) Identifying, contacting, 
and establishing metadata harvesting / metadata brokering arrangements and 
technical relationships with participating CIC libraries; 3) Working with 
project PI and research programmer to design, implement, develop, and test 
basic metadata portal(s) and search service(s); 4) Assisting with research 
into issues relating to advanced harvesting and indexing service design, 
portal and search interface system features, and service usability; 5) 
Coordinating interactions with the CIC-DLIOC (and others as appropriate); 
6) Documenting OAI harvesting and search services developed during the 
course of the project (including co-authoring journal articles and 
conference papers); and 7) insuring potential long-term sustainability of 
project services and technologies through reliance on community standards 
and best practices. Incumbent will help draft project interim and final 
reports to CIC and participating libraries.
