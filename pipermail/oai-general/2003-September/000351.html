Yes, there is a very big difference in practice (and not in law) between
self-archiving interoperably and self-archiving arbitrarily. That is why
the above comment ended with:

    &quot;OAI compliance is irrelevant to the distinction, but highly desirable
    for functionality.

I might have added that the reason the BOAI (Budapest Open ACCESS
Initiative) and other open-access movements are so closely associated
with the OAI (Open ACCESS Initiative) -- and the reason the free
archive-creating software we designed to facilitate ad accelerate
self-archiving was made to create OAI-compliant archives
(http:/eprints.org) -- was precisely so as to provide this important
functionality.

But the background question and answer remain the same: There is no legal
difference whatosever between a &quot;personal website&quot; and an &quot;institutional
website,&quot; and self-archiving authors should ignore completely any
attempts to make such a distinction, or to apply conditions on the basis
of such a distinction. The distinction is vacuous. (No one can legislate
how an author applies the metadata tags AUTHORNAME, TITLE, JOURNALNAME,
or DATE to his self-archived paper so as to make it interoperable with
other such papers. Period. And that's all OAI-compliance amounts to!)

&gt;<i> Publications mounted on the latter would be 
</I>&gt;<i> more accessible to searchers than ones mounted on the former. 
</I>
The first red herring is whether the disk sector is labeled
&quot;my-website&quot; or &quot;my-sector-of-my-departmental-erint-archive&quot;. This
distinction is vacuous and carries no legal weight. The second red
herring is whether the metadata tags accompanying my text include the
OAI identifiers AUTHORNAME, etc. Again, not a legal matter and not the
business of any other party but myself (and my institution.)

So, not legal difference, but a *big* functional difference. So
self-archive. And self-archive OAI-compliantly.

&gt;<i> While we are 
</I>&gt;<i> rightly concerned primarily with making the scholarly literature available 
</I>&gt;<i> on the WWW free of charge, we cannot ignore the question (actually the 
</I>&gt;<i> classical librarian/information scientist's question!) of how people are 
</I>&gt;<i> going to find the items they want amongst the enormous mass that is there. 
</I>
We ae not ignoring it, and that is precisely why eprints.org (and
dspace, and other) eprints archives are OAI-compliant, and why OAI
service providers like OAIster selectively harvest their metadata:
