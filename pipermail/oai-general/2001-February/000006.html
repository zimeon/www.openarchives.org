<PRE>Hello OAI-General List:

I'm looking for some information in general 'layman's terms' what your
organization is doing with regard to exchange of scholarly writings.

Let me explain myself.  Perhaps that may give a clue about where my
questions originate.  I am wondering if our organization, Brookhaven
National Laboratory and specifically our Information Services Division (ISD
which encompasses the Research Library where I work),  might either benefit
from participation in what you are doing or might be a pertinent information
source for you.

I am not a librarian, nor am I a scientist.  I am a systems specialist who
works with relational databases in a research library.  Part of my function
is to maintain a repository of both metadata and content of various
publications related to the pursuit of federally-funded research and
development activities.  I work with both UNIX and NT based systems; I've
worked extensively in data manipulation activities to include UNIX
utilities, perl, cgi scripting in shell and perl, SGML and HTML.   I've
dabbled with XML.  I understand the concepts of DTDs and parsing.  I
partially understand your specification from the protocol for metadata
harvesting.  I've read much at your site.

Would someone be able to provide me with an outline of how OAI might be of
benefit to us?   Or how we might contribute?  Have you a public affairs
representative perhaps?

I appreciate any and all information you might provide.

Thank you.
