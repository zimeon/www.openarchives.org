	Don't forget, Frederic, instructions to unsubscribe are in the
headers of *every single message* that is sent on the list.  For those who
can't be bothered to look at mail headers, you can unsubscribe with either
of the following URLs:
<http://oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu/mailman/listinfo/oai-general>,
<mailto:oai-general-request@oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu?subject=unsubscribe>.
	However, we should keep in mind that, possibly, the people sending
these messages to the *entire list* aren't trying to be rude and annoying,
but are themselves unable to read English.  Or maybe they don't know what
a URL is?

Patrick,

Unfortunately, the appearance of being brain-dead is becoming endemic 
here in the United States. The idea of "thinking" about something before 
doing it is almost alien to most of the population. Perhaps if it were 
packaged in a 30 second time bite with attractive video, pavlov's 
creatures would understand.

Hehe.

Best wishes,

Gerry :}

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10304011921430.4372-100000@pandora>

Here are 37 powerpoints designed to explain and promote open access
through the self-archiving of institutional (peer-reviewed) research
output (BOAI-1). You are free to use or adapt some or all of them in
your own talks or papers:

http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/self-archiving.ppt
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/self-archiving.htm

Stevan Harnad

PS It would be helpful if someone could supplement the growth charts
with equivalent data from BOAI-2 (creating/converting open-access
journals). Those too should be on a per-paper basis, and extrapolated
into the future. The target is open-access to all 2,000,000 refereed
papers appearing annually in the planet's 20,000 refereed journals.

--------------
NETWORKED KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION SYSTEMS/SOURCES
6TH ANNUAL WORKSHOP
"BUILDING A MEANINGFUL WEB: FROM TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION SYSTEMS=20
TO NEW SEMANTIC TOOLS"

The Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Sources (NKOS) Ad Hoc Working=20
Group (http://nkos.slis.kent.edu) will hold its 6th annual workshop on May 3=
1=20
at the Alice Pratt Brown Hall of Rice University in Houston TX in conjunctio=
n=20
with the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (www.jcdl.org).

This year's workshop, "Building a Meaningful Web," will focus on the=20
transformation of traditional controlled vocabulary approaches, such as=20
authority lists and thesauri, to new forms of knowledge representation such=20
as ontologies, topic maps, and semantic web components, where relationships=20
between concepts are richer and more extensive and the requirements of=20
computer processing are met. =A0The session will include discussion of the=20
contribution of best practices from more traditional approaches to the desig=
n=20
of new knowledge organization systems.

The goal is to bring these often disparate communities together so that the=20
newer efforts of KOS development can take advantage of the best practices of=
=20
more traditional systems and the standards for traditional KOS structures ca=
n=20
benefit from the technological advances being developed to support improved=20
semantic access to web content. =A0Topics include:

* Best practices of traditional KOS systems and their application to newer=20
semantic forms (ontologies, topic maps, etc.)
* Relevant standards and their status
* Methodologies for transforming legacy KOSs into newer semantic forms
* Development of web services to support the use of KOSs in web-based digita=
l=20
libraries
* Updates on current NKOS projects and applications and related NISO=20
standards activities

The format will consist of invited and volunteered short presentations and=20
plenty of discussion. =A0In addition participants will be given the opportun=
ity=20
to introduce their work and their interests briefly during the workshop=20
introduction.

More detail about the program is available at the NKOS web site at=20
http://nkos.slis.kent.edu.

Registration information is available from the JCDL web site (www.jcdl.org).=
=20
=A0Early registration ends on April 25. =A0Discounts are available for IEEE,=

<BR>NETWORKED KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION SYSTEMS/SOURCES
<BR>6TH ANNUAL WORKSHOP
<BR>"BUILDING A MEANINGFUL WEB: FROM TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION SYST=
EMS TO NEW SEMANTIC TOOLS"
<BR>
<BR>The Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Sources (NKOS) Ad Hoc Worki=
ng Group (http://nkos.slis.kent.edu) will hold its 6th annual workshop on Ma=
y 31 at the Alice Pratt Brown Hall of Rice University in Houston TX in conju=
nction with the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (www.jcdl.org).
<BR>
<BR>This year's workshop, "Building a Meaningful Web," will focus on the tra=
nsformation of traditional controlled vocabulary approaches, such as authori=
ty lists and thesauri, to new forms of knowledge representation such as onto=
logies, topic maps, and semantic web components, where relationships between=
 concepts are richer and more extensive and the requirements of computer pro=
cessing are met. =A0The session will include discussion of the contribution=20=
of best practices from more traditional approaches to the design of new know=
ledge organization systems.
<BR>
<BR>The goal is to bring these often disparate communities together so that=20=
the newer efforts of KOS development can take advantage of the best practice=
s of more traditional systems and the standards for traditional KOS structur=
es can benefit from the technological advances being developed to support im=
proved semantic access to web content. =A0Topics include:
<BR>
<BR>* Best practices of traditional KOS systems and their application to new=
er semantic forms (ontologies, topic maps, etc.)
<BR>* Relevant standards and their status
<BR>* Methodologies for transforming legacy KOSs into newer semantic forms
<BR>* Development of web services to support the use of KOSs in web-based di=
gital libraries
<BR>* Updates on current NKOS projects and applications and related NISO sta=
ndards activities
<BR>
<BR>The format will consist of invited and volunteered short presentations a=
nd plenty of discussion. =A0In addition participants will be given the oppor=

annoying email messages to people .... unfortunately I probably don't have
as much time in my life to go looking round websites trying to work out how
to unsubscribe ... you wanna tell MR CORNELL to sort out his stupid
unfriendly website ... I must have had a hundred emails from people wanting
to unsubscribe from this pathetic place...it just goes to show some people
think they are clever...but are blinded by the mere formalities of life?!

PS if you mail me an unfriendly email like that again I will come over there
and flatten you.....get it you pathetic individual!!!!!

The OAI-general list is for information about OAI-related activities.

Lately there have been far too many unsubscribe requests (instead visit
http://oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu/mailman/listinfo/oai-general and use the
edit options button), technical/implementation questions (these should go
instead to the oai-implementers list), and off-topic discussion often cc'd
to many lists. Posts will now be moderated for appropriateness in the hope
of improving this list's signal-to-noise ratio. Sadly, this will add a
delay to posting.

Also, a reminder, please keep posts civil (an apology from Seth Whitcher
is included below).

Cheers,
Simeon

Subject: apologies to -

Tim and other forum members

I would like to apologise to Tim Brody and any other forum members for my
insulting email yesterday. It is not in my nature to send these kind of
messages to all and sundry and I can honestly say this was a knee-jerk
reaction to an email from Tim pointing out how to unsubscribe from the
forum which I over-reacted to. My annoyance stemmed from the fact that I
was receiving approximately 5-10 emails a day from people wanting to
unsubscribe from the OAI forum and had previously seen a rude message to a
subscriber, outlining her/his inability to navigate and unsubscribe from
the forum, which I found very irritating. Once again, I would like to
offer my sincerest apologies to those of you who have been affected by
this unfortunate situation.

Yours Sincerely
Seth Whitcher

Subject: [OAI-general] Herbert Van de Sompel Receives Kilgour Award for Research in
 Library and IT
Message-ID: <sea67a97.006@129.186.11.21>

For Immediate Release, April 2003
For more information Contact:
Mary Taylor, 312-280-4267
mtaylor@ala.org 

2003 LITA Frederick G. Kilgour Award winner announced

Dr. Herbert Van de Sompel of the Los Alamos National Laboratories is
the winner of the Frederick G. Kilgour Award for Research in Library and
Information Technology for 2003. OCLC Online Computer Library Center,
Inc., and the Library and Information Technology Association (LITA), a
division of the American Library Association, sponsor the award.

The award was established to honor the achievements of Frederick G.
Kilgour, the founder of OCLC and a seminal figure in library automation.
The award is given to a person who has amassed a significant body of
"real world" research in the field of library and information technology
that has had an impact in the way in which information is published,
stored, retrieved, disseminated or managed. It consists of $2,000, an
expense-paid trip to the ALA Annual Conference, and a citation of
merit.

"The Kilgour Award Committee was delighted to acknowledge the
significant work of Dr. Van de Sompel, whose research has contributed
significantly to not one, but two major current developments in our
field:  linking technologies and metadata harvesting." said Larry Woods,
chair of the award committee. 

Based on the research for his PhD, Herbert and his colleague Patrick
Hochstenbach created SFX, a system that uses information passed from one
information system to create locally appropriate related web links to
other systems.  The SFX system now is in use in hundreds of libraries
worldwide.  Parallel products have been or are now being developed by
various companies, universities, and other players in the library
information technology environment, all based on the insights and
architecture developed for SFX.

A key element of the SFX linking architecture is the OpenURL, a method
for passing bibliographic information from one information system to
another encoded in a URL.  The OpenURL is now being standardized by NISO
(an effort in which Herbert is heavily involved), and shows promise of
becoming a key tool in the interoperation of distributed digital library
systems.  As a matter of fact, it has the potential to change the nature
of links on the Web in general.

With Carl Lagoze, Herbert led an international effort to devise a
protocol by which systems holding descriptive metadata could make that
metadata available for "harvesting" and re-use by other information
systems.  Originally developed to support the building of union catalogs
of metadata derived from distributed e-print archives, the protocol has
been generalized through work in the larger digital library world as the
Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting.  

Dr. Van de Sompel received a Masters degree in Mathematics in 1979, and
a Masters degree in Computer Science in 1981 and a Ph.D. in
Communication Science in 2000 all from Ghent University, Belgium.  He is
now employed at the Research Library of the Los Alamos National
Laboratories in New Mexico as Team Leader, Digital Library Research and
Prototyping Group.

The award will be presented at the LITA President's Program on Monday,
June 23, 2003 at the ALA Annual Conference in Toronto.

                  Alternative Peer Review Models for Scholarship

For a forthcoming presentation [and, of course, the  obligatory associated Web registry and article {:-)],  I am greatly interested in the key articles/report/documents about  Alternative Peer Review for Scholarship, as well as examples of exemplar (Web-based) publishing initiatives  that have implemented one or more of these alternatives.

 The Alternative Models that come to mind are: 

Open Peer Review
Formal Peer Review with Subsequent Commentary
Commentary Only (No Prior Formal  Peer Review)
Pre and/or Post Commentary 
Citation-based Peer Review
Reader-based Peer Review
Computer-Assisted Peer Review
Collaborative Filtering 
Others?

and, of course

No Peer Review (Yes, No Review to Me can be reviewed  as an Alternative).

   I am *particularly* interested in any current research or implementations that are Computer-Assisted such as 
   
    A SOFTWARE PROGRAM TO AID IN PEER REVIEW

William Arms has done some work on this subject. See

be available on the Web.

There are some papers on peer-review at

important Cochrane Review, available from the National electronic Library

Background

Editorial peer-review is a globally used tool to select submissions to
biomedical journals and improve their content. As such it
has a central role in biomedical science. The knowledge base of peer-review
has traditionally lagged far behind its acceptability
and use as a quality assessment tool. In the last decade a growing body of
research has been available, making synthesis and
conceptual analysis possible. We reviewed the evidence of the effects of
processes undertaken as part of editorial peer-review of
original research studies submitted for paper or electronic publication in
biomedical journals.

Objectives

To estimate the effects of processes in editorial peer-review.

Search strategy

The following electronic sources were searched:
The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2000), MEDLINE 1966 to February 2000,
Australasian Medical Index 1980 to 2000, Best Evidence

searched reference lists of relevant articles, posted requests on the EASE
and WAME web sites, the Locknet site and hand-searched
books and JAMA theme issues and relevant bulletins. The WAME (World
Association of Medical Editors), EASE (European
Association of Science Editors), and CSE (Council of Science Editors)
memberships were canvassed in an effort to locate further
published and unpublished studies.

Selection criteria

We included prospective or retrospective comparative studies, with two or
more comparison groups, generated by random or
other methods, reporting original research regardless of publication status.
We hoped to find studies identifying good submissions
on the basis of: importance of the topic dealt with, relevance of the topic
to the journal, usefulness of the topic, soundness of
methods, soundness of ethics, completeness and accuracy of reporting.
Data collection and analysis
We identified 135 reports of studies, which could possibly fulfil our
inclusion criteria. Twenty-one of these fulfilled our criteria
and we excluded the remaining 114 studies from our review. Because of the
diversity of study questions, viewpoints, methods
and outcomes we carried out a descriptive review of included studies
grouping them by broad study questions.

Main results

The well-researched practice of concealing the identities of peer-reviewers
or authors, while laborious and expensive, appears to
have little effect on the outcome of the quality assessment process (9
studies). Checklists and other standardisation media have
little reliable evidence to support their use (2 studies). There is no
evidence that referees' training has any effect on the quality of
the outcome (2 studies). Electronic communication media do not appear to
have an effect on quality (2 studies). On the basis of
one study little can be said about the ability of the peer-review process to
detect bias against unconventional drugs. Validity of
peer-review was tested by only one small study in a specialist area.
Editorial peer-review appears to make papers more readable
and improve the general quality of reporting (2 studies), but the evidence
for this may be of limited generalisability.

Reviewers' conclusions

At present there is little empirical evidence to support the use of
editorial peer-review as a mechanism to ensure quality of
biomedical research, despite its widespread use and costs. A large,
well-funded programme of research on the effects of editorial
peer-review is needed.

Subject: [OAI-general] Alternative Peer Review Models for Scholarship


                  Alternative Peer Review Models for Scholarship

For a forthcoming presentation [and, of course, the  obligatory associated
Web registry and article {:-)],  I am greatly interested in the key
articles/report/documents about  Alternative Peer Review for Scholarship, as
well as examples of exemplar (Web-based) publishing initiatives  that have
implemented one or more of these alternatives.

 The Alternative Models that come to mind are: 

Open Peer Review
Formal Peer Review with Subsequent Commentary
Commentary Only (No Prior Formal  Peer Review)
Pre and/or Post Commentary 
Citation-based Peer Review
Reader-based Peer Review
Computer-Assisted Peer Review
Collaborative Filtering 
Others?

and, of course

No Peer Review (Yes, No Review to Me can be reviewed  as an Alternative).

   I am *particularly* interested in any current research or implementations
that are Computer-Assisted such as 
   
    A SOFTWARE PROGRAM TO AID IN PEER REVIEW
By Alvar Loria (1)  Gladys Faba (2) for the ARTEMISA Selection Committee 
(1)Instituto Nacional de Nutrición Salvador Zubiran, 14000 Mexico City,

Message-ID: <seabd770.032@129.186.11.21>

    _Current Data and Key Literature on UnCited Scholarship_ 

   I am greatly interested in current data and key literature on UnCited
Scholarship. I have searched Google and found several select items, for example:

David P. Hamilton (1990). "Publishing by and for?-  the numbers
_Science_, New Series, 250 (4986) (December 7): 1331-1332.
[ http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/hamilton1.html  ]

David P. Hamilton (1991). "Research papers: who's uncited now?,"
_Science_, New Series,  251 (4989) (January 4):  25.
[http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/hamilton2.html ]

John A. Tainer; Helmut A. Abt; Lowell L. Hargens; David M. Bott; F. W. Lancaster; James H. Pannell; Edward B. Nuhfer; Charles L. McGehee; William A. Banks; David A. Pendlebury (1991) "Science, citation, and funding," _Science_  251 (5000) (March 22):1408-1411.
[http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/pendlebury.html  ]

Eugene Garfield (1998). "Commentary: I had a dream ... about
uncitedness," _The Scientist_ 12 (14) (July 6): 10.
[http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1998/July/comm_980706.html  ] 

Quentin L.Burrell (2002). "Will this paper ever be cited?," _Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology_ 53(3)(February): 232-2002 

For a homogenous set of papers given the average rate at which a paper attracts citations, Burrell calculates the probability that a paper will ever be cited assuming it has not been cited in a given time. The longer the elapsed time without citation the greater the likelihood it will never be cited. 
[ http://www.asis.org/Publications/JASIS/vol53n03.html ]

Charles A. Schwartz (1997). "The rise and fall of uncitedness," _College & Research Libraries_ 58: (January): 19-29. 

Large-scale uncitedness refers to the remarkable proportion of articles that do not receive a single citation within five years of publication. Equally remarkable is the brief and troubled history of this area of inquiry, which was prone to miscalculation, misinterpretation, and politicization. This article reassesses large-scale uncitedness as both a general phenomenon in the scholarly communication system and a case study of library and information science, where its rate is 72 percent.

 I am also (particularly)  interested in Any and All articles / reports /studies / documents relating to the value of conventional Peer Review within the context of Uncitedness of Peer Viewed publications [Please do not crucify me for raising the issue]:-)

Hi, Gerry!

I've been interested on this subject too. And I read on the article
"Coases' Penguim, or Linux, The Nature of The Firm" something about
Slashdot review schema. I know that it isn't a peer review model
for scholarship, but I saw excellent ideas that can be implemented in a
model for scholarship.

You can see more on: http://slashdot.org/faq/. See the topics "Book
review" and "Comments and Moderation". Or you can read the article that I
mentioned above.

Regards,
Evelyn.
