<PRE>Hi!
 
Good to hear from you! Good question!
 
One of the activities related to OAI since its conception is the
Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, NDLTD, see
www.ndltd.org.
 
Your university, and more generally the Alliances, are encouraged to
join NDLTD. It is one of the easiest ways to engage a large segment of
university populations (faculty, graduate students, researchers, and
those in support positions throughout the administration and IT
community and library) in digital library activities.
 
We use OAI, so that individual universities have some type of
specialized repository (using tailored software, such as ETD-db, the
electronic thesis and dissertation database, or its adaptations into
other languages or settings, such as for the Australasian Digital Thesis
project) or more general software (e.g., DSpace with plugins developed
in UK, Fedora with additional software such as the VITAL system
developed by VTLS, Eprints, etc.). At the state (e.g., efforts by
OhioLink), national (e.g., activities in Brazil connected with IBICT),
and regional (e.g., the ADT effort mentioned above) levels, OAI also is
used.  Then, at the global level, OCLC runs our Union Catalog using OAI
(see <A HREF="http://alcme.oclc.org/ndltd/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=ListSets">http://alcme.oclc.org/ndltd/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=ListSets</A> and an
SRU service atop that).  On the service provider side, there are a
variety of metadata or full-text based free services that work from the
Union Catalog, run by Scirus (connected with Elsevier), VTLS, CALIS in
China, Virginia Tech, etc.
 
I'd be happy to work with you if this is of interest.  If you are coming
to ICADL 2005, the International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries,
in Bangkok in December, or other events next year, perhaps we can meet
to discuss this further.
 
Hope this helps!  Warm regards, Ed Fox

Subject: [OAI-general] Afghanistan digital libraries project



Hi all, 

Long time lurker, first time poster. 

We are working on an initiative in Afghanistan called Afghan eQuality
Alliances. The goal of this initiative (working with USAID and other
funding sources) is to restore and develop the Kabul University to be
competitive and effective in the 21st century. We are tasked with
developing core competencies that each 'department' or 'faculty' will
complete. One of those core competencies is the development of a digital
library relevant for each department. 

I am looking for feedback about various issues that should be addressed
with the participants during an upcoming week long workshop about
digital libraries. 

I have reviewed the <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/">http://www.openarchives.org/</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/">http://www.openarchives.org/</A>&gt;  site, is there anything else that we
should be focusing on? 

Thanks for your time.
