Subject: [OAI-general] Reorganization of UIUC Library OAI Providers
Message-ID: <3FCE690A.5010408@uiuc.edu>

Hi all,

We've just completed a reorganization of the OAI data providers at the 
University of Illinois Library, Urbana-Champaign.

We have redirected our old providers at:

  http://bolder.grainger.uiuc.edu/uiliboaiprovider/2.0/oai.asp (2.0)
  http://bolder.grainger.uiuc.edu/uiliboaiprovider/oai.asp (1.1)

To our new dynamic gateway provider at:

   http://oaigateway.grainger.uiuc.edu/oai.asp

We plan to maintain the redirection for the foreseeable future, but anyone 
harvesting from the old baseURLs should eventually begin harvesting from the 
new baseURL.

Unfortunately, as part of the reorganization we had to assign new 
identifiers to all of the records, so the old identifiers starting with 
either 'oai:oai.library.uiuc.edu:' (2.0) or 'oai:uiLib:' (1.1) should be 
considered deleted, and you should perform a complete reharvest from the new 
provider.

The new provider is actually acting as an aggregator/gateway to seven other 
individual OAI providers which are maintained in the UIUC library.  This 
aggregation currently provides ~165,000 records.  Since the aggregation is 
occurring dynamically, directly from the original providers, record 
staleness should not be an issue.  All records include a provenance 
container describing their origin.  Care should be taken to prevent 
duplicate records if harvesting from both the aggregator/gateway and from 
one of the source OAI providers.

Anyone wishing to harvest all records from the UIUC Library should use 
aggregator/gateway baseURL.  However, people wishing to harvest more 
selectively should consider harvesting from one of the individual providers 
described below:

   Sheet Music - http://sheetmusic.grainger.uiuc.edu/oai.asp

   Aerial Photos - http://aerialphotos.grainger.uiuc.edu/oai.asp

   EAD Finding Aids - http://findingaids.grainger.uiuc.edu/oai.asp

   Engineering Documents - http://engdocs.grainger.uiuc.edu/oai.asp

   Digital Imaging And - http://images.library.uiuc.edu:8081/cgi-bin/oai.exe
   Media Technology
   Initiative (DIMTI)

   Wolfram Mathworld - http://nsdl.grainger.uiuc.edu/WolframMathworld/oai.asp	

   Wolfram Functions - http://nsdl.grainger.uiuc.edu/WolframFunctions/oai.asp

   Expect more to be added in the near future...


We also have a static OAI gateway provider at:

http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/gateway/oai.asp/www.acnatsci.org/library/collections/imls/nlg/AcadNatSciStatic.xml

So far these new providers have passed the various tests we could think of 
such as the Repository Explorer and our own internal validating harvester, 
but if anyone encounters any problems harvesting from us please let us know. 
  Comments about the reorganization in general are also welcome.  Anyone 
interested in the nitty-gritty details can take a look at our internal 
planning document at http://128.174.36.55/oaiprovidersnew.htm although it 
doesn't exactly reflect everything we have done.

Kind regards,
	Tom

Subject: [OAI-general] "info" URI update
Message-ID: <3FD34B39.A1F3DFE4@lanl.gov>

Hi All:

Following our announcement of the "info" URI scheme a couple months back
[1] we would like to notify the list of a revision to the I-D which has
now been posted on the I-D repository [2]. The revision targets three key
areas which further simplify the "info" URI scheme as a facilitator for
referencing information assets:

      a) "info" now excludes any dereference capability
         Consequence: no resolution systems are to be associated with "info"
URIs

      b) "info" now includes support for full hierarchy
         Consequence: the identifier component of an "info" URI may include "/"
chars

      c) "info" now includes support for URI fragments
         Consequence: secondary resources may be indirectly identified by "info"
URIs

Additionally, three other changes have also been made:

      d) The BNF now reuses many of the RFC2396bis productions
         Consequence: facilitates comparison with future generic URI syntax

      e) Some of the examples have been changed for simplification
         Consequence: removes possible confusion with other works in progres

      f) Section 7 "Rationale" has been improved
         Consequence: clearer justification why "info" URI scheme is required

Together with this new I-D we are pleased to announce that an early
implementation of the "info" URI Registry is now available online at the
"info" website [3]. The namespace registration records are human/machine
accessible and can be harvested using the OAI-PMH protocol [4].
Alternative disclosures of registration records using e.g. RSS may be
made available at a future time.

Two additional documents are also made available on the "info" website
[3]:

      1. A comprehensive FAQ which answers common questions re "info"
        (Follow the link <About "info" URI> on the menu bar)

      2. An "info" Registry policy document
        (Follow the link <Registry Policy> on the menu bar

Please note that both documents are currently evolving and are being made
available at this time for discussion purposes. They should not be treated
as authoritative but will be improved through comments received. [Also
note that the link to the I-D on the "info" website points to the previous
version ('-00'), not the current version ('-01') - we will amend this.]

We would like to invite feedback on the Registry and associated documents
and any comments on the revised I-D.

One particular question we have regards the use of the BNF productions
from the draft RFC2396bis [5] rather than from the reference RFC2396 [6]
itself. The reasons are twofold: i) we would like to futureproof this
specification, and ii) the "segment" production in RFC2396 is overly
restrictive, and has now been generalized in the work ongoing in the
successor to that RFC. We believe this is the correct approach - and seems
to follow the approach taken in the IRI work [7].

Subject: [OAI-general] Announcing DSTC's MetaSuite 4.0 product release
Message-ID: <200312120543.hBC5h5dD004603@piglet.dstc.edu.au>

Colleagues,

DSTC is pleased to announce the Release 4.0 of our MetaSuite product
family for managing Dublin Core and similar metadata.  Products include:

  *  HotMeta - a web-enabled metadata repository and query engine,
     and associated metadata indexing, harvesting and maintenance
     tools,
  *  MetaEdit - a validating schema-based metadata editor for use
     with Hotmeta and stand-alone, 
  *  MetaSchema - a metadata schema compiler for creating custom
     metadata schemas, and
  *  MetaSaurus - a tool for generating "browse tree" web pages 
     from subject thesauri.

The key new features in the MetaSuite 4.0 release are as follows.

  *  The HotMeta metadata repository now supports for OAI-PMH,
     allowing a HotMeta installation to be configured as an 
     OAI 2.0 Repository.
  *  HotMeta now has support for incremental harvesting of metadata
     from OAI 2.0 Repositories.
  *  HotMeta now includes a GUI-based tool for creating and managing 
     an OAI repository register, an OAI harvesting schedule, and 
     a log of past OAI harvests.
  *  MetaSaurus can now generate browse trees for ISO 2788 thesaurii,
     including support for synonyms and related terms.

For more information, please refer to the DSTC website:

"Open Access and Retrieval: Liberating the Scholarly Literature"

"An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make
possible an unprecedented public good"
[ http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml ]

   I am pleased to inform you that my chapter on 

"Open Access and Retrieval: Liberating the Scholarly Literature"
written for a volume on  _E-Serials Collection Management: Transitions,

Trends, and Technicalities _  (edited by David C. Fowler. New York : 
Haworth Information Press, 2004) has been officially published

FROM THE CONCLUSION:
Whether the self-archiving model becomes the new paradigm for scholarly
publishing as 
envisioned by its proponents will depend not only on improved archiving
and retrieval 
software and systems but also, and more importantly, on the degree to
which
all stakeholders endorse and embrace its potential as a viable and
sustainable
publishing alternative.
