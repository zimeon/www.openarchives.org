Subject: [OAI-general] Beta OAI-PMH specification re rights pertaining to
	metadata
Message-ID: <41893260.7040505@lanl.gov>

Hi all,

We are very pleased to announce the availability of a beta specification
detailing an approach to convey rights expressions pertaining to metadata
disseminated via the OAI-PMH.

This beta specification is the result of the work of the OAI-rights
technical committee that started its activities in September 2003,
following a joint initiative of the Open Archives Initiative and Project
RoMEO.

(*) The beta specification is available at:
<http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-rights.htm>

(*) The press-release that announced the launch of the OAI-rights
activity is available at:
<http://www.openarchives.org/news/oairightspress030929.html>.  This press
release includes the list of participants in the OAI-rights effort.

We hereby solicit public feedback on the specification. We aim to release
the specification by the end of 2004, and therefore request feedback by
the end of November 2004. Please send your comments to the
oai-implementers list <oai-implementers@openarchives.org>.

Greetings!

Carl Lagoze

Subject: [OAI-general] CiteSeer OAI compliant
Message-ID: <4197BF9B.8000204@ist.psu.edu>

We would like to announce that CiteSeer, a public digital library and 
search engine in computer
and information science, is now OAI compliant. Currently, CiteSeer has 
over 700,000 documents,
all from web crawling or author submission and is being hosted at Penn 
State's School of Information
Sciences and Technology.

CiteSeer OAI metadata is automatically generated and does have errors 
which we hope to correct in
the future using new automated correcting and checking algorithms.

For more details on harvesting the OAI metadata please see:

Best regards,

Lee Giles
