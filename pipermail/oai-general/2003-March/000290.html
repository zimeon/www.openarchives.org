Excuse my ignorance, not currently having a comprehensive understanding of
OAI, but is the bigger issue not one of duplication (rather than duplication
of effort). If your physicist places the same item in both archives, and a
service provider (say OAIster for example) harvests from both archives, is
there a mechanism to de-dupe the two identical items? If not then it is
likely that over time duplicate entires will present a major problem.

Is this being addressed??

Cheers

Peter

Subject: [OAI-general] Re: [BOAI] Re: Cliff Lynch on Institutional Archives



Disciplinary/subject archives vs. Institutional/Organisation/Region based
archives. This is going to be a key challenge now open archives begin to
gain momentum. 

For example; we are planning a University-wide eprints archive. I am 
concerned that some physisists will want to place their items in both the
university eprints service AND the arXiv physics archive. They may 
be required to use the university service, but want to use arXiv as it is
the primary source for their discipline. This is a duplication of 
effort and a potential irritation.

Ultimately, of course, I'd hope that diciplinary archives will be replaced
with subject-specific OAI service providers harvesting from the
institutional archives. But there is going to be a very long transition
period in which the solution evolves from our experience.

What I'm asking is; has anyone given consideration to ways of smoothing over
this duplication of effort? Possibly some negotiated automated process for
insitutional archives uploading to the subject archive, or at least
assisting the author in the process.

This isn't the biggest issue, but it'd be good to address it before it
becomes more of a problem.

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/service/listproviders.html">http://www.openarchives.org/service/listproviders.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> -- it is not the full-texts of data-archives that need to be &quot;fed&quot; to 
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., harvested by) the OAI service providers, but only their 
</I>&gt;<i> metadata.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hence my conclusion that distributed, interoperable OAI institutional 
</I>&gt;<i> archives are enough (and the fastest route to open-access). No need to 
</I>&gt;<i> harvest their contents into central OAI discipline-based archives 
</I>&gt;<i> (except perhaps for redundancy, as backup). Their OAI interoperability 
</I>&gt;<i> should be enough so that the OAI service-providers can (among other

</I>&gt;<i> computable
</I>&gt;<i> criterion) by harvesting the metadata alone, without the need to harvest
</I>&gt;<i> full-text data-contents too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It should be noted, though, that Thomas Krichel's excellent RePec 
</I>&gt;<i> archive and service in Economics -- <A HREF="http://repec.org/">http://repec.org/</A> -- goes well 
</I>&gt;<i> beyond the confines of OAI-harvesting! RePec harvests non-OAI content 
</I>&gt;<i> too, along lines similar to the way ResearchIndex/citeseer -- 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs">http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs</A> -- harvests non-OAI content in computer 
</I>&gt;<i> science. What I said about there being no need to &quot;feed&quot; institutional 
</I>&gt;<i> OAI archive content into disciplinary OAI archives certainly does not 
</I>&gt;<i> apply to *non-OAI* content, which would otherwise be scattered 
</I>&gt;<i> willy-nilly all over the net and not integrated in any way. Here 
</I>&gt;<i> RePec's and ResearchIndex's harvesting is invaluable, especially as 
</I>&gt;<i> RePec already does (and ResearchIndex has announced that it plans to) 
</I>&gt;<i> make all its harvested content OAI-compliant!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To summarize: The goal is to get all research papers, pre- and 
</I>&gt;<i> post-peer-review, openly accessible (and OAI-interoperable) as soon as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. (These are BOAI Strategies 1 [self-archiving] and 2 
</I>&gt;<i> [open-access journals]: <A HREF="http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml">http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ). In principle this can be done by (1) self-archiving them in central 
</I>&gt;<i> OAI disciplinary archives like the Physics arXiv (the biggest and 
</I>&gt;<i> first of its kind) -- <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions">http://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions</A>
</I>&gt;<i> -- by (2) self-archiving them in distributed institutional OAI 
</I>&gt;<i> Archives -- <A HREF="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/tim.ppt">http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/tim.ppt</A> -- by (3) 
</I>&gt;<i> self-archiving them on arbitrary Web and FTP sites (and hoping they 
</I>&gt;<i> will be found or harvested by services like Repec or ResearchIndex) or 
</I>&gt;<i> by (4) publishing them in open-access journals (BOAI Strategy 2: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.soros.org/openaccess/journals.shtml">http://www.soros.org/openaccess/journals.shtml</A> ).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point was only that because researchers and their institutions
</I>&gt;<i> (*not* their disciplines) have shared interests vested in maximizing 
</I>&gt;<i> their joint research impact and its rewards, institution-based 
</I>&gt;<i> self-archiving (2) is a more promising way to go -- in the age of 
</I>&gt;<i> OAI-interoperability -- than discipline-based self-archiving (1), even 
</I>&gt;<i> though the latter began earlier. It is also obvious that both (1) and
</I>&gt;<i> (2) are preferable to arbitrary Web and FTP self-archiving (3), which 
</I>&gt;<i> began even earlier (although harvesting arbitrary Website and FTP 
</I>&gt;<i> contents into OAI-compliant Archives is still a welcome makeshift 
</I>&gt;<i> strategy until the practise of OAI self-archiving is up to speed). 
</I>&gt;<i> Creating new open-access journals and converting the established 
</I>&gt;<i> (20,000) toll-access journals to open-access is desirable too, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> is obviously a much slower and more complicated path to open access 
</I>&gt;<i> than self-archiving, so should be pursued in parallel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My conclusion in favor of institutional self-archiving is based on the 
</I>&gt;<i> evidence and on logic, and it represents a change of thinking, for I 
</I>&gt;<i> had originally advocated (3) Web/FTP self-archiving -- 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.arl.org/scomm/subversive/toc.html">http://www.arl.org/scomm/subversive/toc.html</A> -- then switched 
</I>&gt;<i> allegiance to central self-archiving (1), even creating a 
</I>&gt;<i> discipline-based archive: <A HREF="http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/</A> But with 
</I>&gt;<i> the advent of OAI in 1999, plus a little reflection, it became

</I>&gt;<i> direct, and most natural road to open access: <A HREF="http://www.eprints.org/">http://www.eprints.org/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> And since then its accumulating momentum seems to be confirming that 
</I>&gt;<i> this is indeed so: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/2212.html">http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/2212.html</A>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   The primary sense of belonging
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   of a scholar in her research activities is with the disciplinary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   community of which she thinks herself a part... It certainly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   is not with the institution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That may or may not be the case, but in any case it is irrelevant to 
</I>&gt;<i> the question of which is the more promising route to open-access. Our 
</I>&gt;<i> primary sense of belonging may be with our family, our community, our 
</I>&gt;<i> creed, our tribe, or even our species. But our rewards (research grant 
</I>&gt;<i> funding and overheads, salaries, postdocs and students attracted to 
</I>&gt;<i> our research, prizes and honors) are intertwined and shared with our 
</I>&gt;<i> institutions (our employers) and not our disciplines (which are often 
</I>&gt;<i> in fact the locus of competition for those same rewards!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Therefore, if you want to fill
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   institutional archives---which I agree is the best long-run way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   to enhance access and preservation to scholarly research--- [the]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   institutional archive has to be accompanied by a discipline-based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   aggregation process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But the question is whether this &quot;aggregation&quot; needs to be the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;feeding&quot; of institutional OAI archive contents into disciplinary OAI 
</I>&gt;<i> archives, or merely the &quot;feeding&quot; of OAI metadata into OAI services.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The RePEc project has produced such an aggregator
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   for economics for a while now. I am sure that other, similar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   projects will follow the same aims, but, with the benefit of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   hindsight, offer superior service. The lack of such services
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   in many disciplines,  or the lack of interoperability between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   disciplinary and  institutional archives, are major obstacle to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the filling  the institutional archives.  There are no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   inherent contradictions between institution-based archives
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   and disciplinary aggregators,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no contradiction. In fact, I suspect this will prove to be a 
</I>&gt;<i> non-issue, once we confirm that (a) we agree on the need for 
</I>&gt;<i> OAI-compliance and (b) &quot;aggregation&quot; amounts to metadata-harvesting 
</I>&gt;<i> and OAI service-provision when the full-texts are in the institutional 
</I>&gt;<i> archive are OAI-compliant (and calls for full-text harvesting only 
</I>&gt;<i> if/when they are not). Content &quot;aggregation,&quot; in other words, is a 
</I>&gt;<i> paper-based notion. In the online era, it merely means digital sorting 
</I>&gt;<i> of the pointers to the content.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, it is not *publishing* habits that need to be changed, but
</I>&gt;<i> *archiving* habits, which are an online supplement, not a substitute, 
</I>&gt;<i> for existing (and unchanged) publishing habits.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; Faculty are typically best at creating new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; knowledge, not maintaining the record of this process of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; creation. Worse still, this faculty member must not only manage 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; content but must manage a dissemination system such as a personal 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; Web site, playing the role of system administrator (or the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; manager of someone serving as a system administrator).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   There are lot of ways in which to maintain a web site or to get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   access to a maintained one. It is a customary activity these days and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   no longer requires much technical expertise. A primitive integration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   of the contents can be done by Google, it requires  no metadata.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Academics don't care  about long-run preservation, so that problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   remains unsolved. In the meantime, the academic who uploads papers to
</I>a web
&gt;<i> &gt;   site takes steps to resolve the most pressing problem, access.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. And uploading it into a departmental OAI Eprints Archive is
</I>&gt;<i> by far the simplest way and most effective way to do all of that. All it
</I>&gt;<i> needs is a policy to mandate it:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; Over the past few years, this has ceased to be a reasonable 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; activity for most amateurs; software complexity, security risks, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; backup requirements, and other problems have generally relegated 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; effective operation of Web sites to professionals who can exploit 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; economies of scale, and who can begin each day with a review of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; recently issued security patches.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   These are technical concerns. When you operate a linux box
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   on the web you simply fire up a script that will download
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the latest version. That is easy enough. Most departments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   have separate web operations. Arguing for one institutional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   archive for digital contents is akin to calling for a single web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   site for an institution. The diseconomies of scale of central
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   administration impose other types of costs that the ones that it was
</I>to
&gt;<i> &gt;   reduce. The secret is to find a middle way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I couldn't quite follow all of this. The bottom line is this: The free 
</I>&gt;<i> Eprints.org software (for example) can be installed within a few days. 
</I>&gt;<i> It can then be replicated to handle all the departmental or research 
</I>&gt;<i> group archives a university wants, with minimal maintenance time or 
</I>&gt;<i> costs. The rest is just down to self-archiving, which takes a few 
</I>&gt;<i> minutes for the first paper, and even less time for subsequent papers 
</I>&gt;<i> (as the repeating metadata -- author, institution, etc., can be 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cloned&quot; into each new deposit template). An institution may wish to 
</I>&gt;<i> impose an institutional &quot;look&quot; on all of its separate eprints 
</I>&gt;<i> archives; but apart from that, they can be as autonomous and as 
</I>&gt;<i> distributed and as many as desired: OAI-interoperability works locally 
</I>&gt;<i> just as well as it does globally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; Today, our faculty time is being wasted, and expended 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; ineffectively, on system administration activities and content 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; curation. And, because system administration is ineffective, it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; places our institutions at risk: because faculty are generally 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; not capable of responding to the endless series of security 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; exposures and patches, our university networks are riddled with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; vulnerable faculty machines intended to serve as points of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cl&gt; distribution for scholarly works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   This is the fight many faculty face every day, where they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   want to innovate scholarly communication, but someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   in the IT department does not give the necessary permission

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think I need to get into this. It's not specific to
