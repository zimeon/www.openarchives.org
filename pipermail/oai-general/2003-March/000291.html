<PRE>hi

this may be stating the obvious, but why not use sets for the separate 
disciplines, aimed at particular service providers? i say it that way 
because some disciplines are not well-defined (namely, computer science) 
so such archives may want to play ball with multiple service providers 
and hence may need different sets.

in any event, for something like physics, a simple set might do the 
trick at the source. then, somewhat in keeping with the Kepler model (as 
published in DLib a while back), the service provider can provide an 
interface for potential data providers to self-register. i know this 
sounds dodgy, but think of it as an alternative mechanism for 
contribution. either individual users submit individual papers or groups 
submit baseURLS - both go through some kind of review and while one 
leads to once-off storage, the other leads to periodic harvesting.

what remains a difficult problem, however, is how to recreate the 
metadata used by the service provider as its native format. so, for a 
typical example, if arXiv classifies items using a specific set 
structure, this is certainly not going to be the default for an 
institutional archive. does the service provider automatically or 
manually reclassify? or does it not allow browsing by categories? in 
either event, the quality of the metadata from the perspective of the 
service provider may be an impetus for potential users to want to 
replicate their effort rather than rely on the automated submission from 
their own institutions ... this needs more thought ...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/Register/BrowseSites.pl">http://www.openarchives.org/Register/BrowseSites.pl</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>-- and OAI service-providers --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/service/listproviders.html">http://www.openarchives.org/service/listproviders.html</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>-- it is not the full-texts of data-archives that need to be &quot;fed&quot; to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(i.e., harvested by) the OAI service providers, but only their metadata.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hence my conclusion that distributed, interoperable OAI institutional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>archives are enough (and the fastest route to open-access). No need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to harvest their contents into central OAI discipline-based archives
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(except perhaps for redundancy, as backup). Their OAI interoperability
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>should be enough so that the OAI service-providers can (among other things)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>do the &quot;virtual aggregation&quot; by discipline (or any other computable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>criterion) by harvesting the metadata alone, without the need to harvest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>full-text data-contents too.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>It should be noted, though, that Thomas Krichel's excellent RePec
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>archive and service in Economics -- <A HREF="http://repec.org/">http://repec.org/</A> -- goes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>well beyond the confines of OAI-harvesting! RePec harvests non-OAI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>content too, along lines similar to the way ResearchIndex/citeseer --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs">http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs</A> -- harvests non-OAI content in computer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>science. What I said about there being no need to &quot;feed&quot; institutional OAI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>archive content into disciplinary OAI archives certainly does not apply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to *non-OAI* content, which would otherwise be scattered willy-nilly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>all over the net and not integrated in any way. Here RePec's and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>ResearchIndex's harvesting is invaluable, especially as RePec already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>does (and ResearchIndex has announced that it plans to) make all its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>harvested content OAI-compliant!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>To summarize: The goal is to get all research papers, pre- and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>post-peer-review, openly accessible (and OAI-interoperable) as soon as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>possible. (These are BOAI Strategies 1 [self-archiving] and 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>[open-access journals]: <A HREF="http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml">http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>). In principle this can be done by (1) self-archiving them in central
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>OAI disciplinary archives like the Physics arXiv (the biggest and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>first of its kind) -- <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions">http://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>-- by (2) self-archiving them in distributed institutional OAI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Archives -- <A HREF="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/tim.ppt">http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/tim.ppt</A> -- by (3)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>self-archiving them on arbitrary Web and FTP sites (and hoping they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>will be found or harvested by services like Repec or ResearchIndex)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>or by (4) publishing them in open-access journals (BOAI Strategy 2:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.soros.org/openaccess/journals.shtml">http://www.soros.org/openaccess/journals.shtml</A> ).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>My point was only that because researchers and their institutions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(*not* their disciplines) have shared interests vested in maximizing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>their joint research impact and its rewards, institution-based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>self-archiving (2) is a more promising way to go -- in the age of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>OAI-interoperability -- than discipline-based self-archiving (1), even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>though the latter began earlier. It is also obvious that both (1) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(2) are preferable to arbitrary Web and FTP self-archiving (3), which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>began even earlier (although harvesting arbitrary Website and FTP contents
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>into OAI-compliant Archives is still a welcome makeshift strategy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>until the practise of OAI self-archiving is up to speed). Creating new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>open-access journals and converting the established (20,000) toll-access
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>journals to open-access is desirable too, but it is obviously a much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>slower and more complicated path to open access than self-archiving,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>so should be pursued in parallel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>My conclusion in favor of institutional self-archiving is based on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>evidence and on logic, and it represents a change of thinking,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>for I had originally advocated (3) Web/FTP self-archiving --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.arl.org/scomm/subversive/toc.html">http://www.arl.org/scomm/subversive/toc.html</A> -- then switched allegiance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to central self-archiving (1), even creating a discipline-based archive:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/</A> But with the advent of OAI in 1999,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>plus a little reflection, it became apparent that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>institutional self-archiving (2) was the fastest, most direct, and most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>natural road to open access: <A HREF="http://www.eprints.org/">http://www.eprints.org/</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>And since then its accumulating momentum seems to be confirming that this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>is indeed so: <A HREF="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/2212.html">http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/2212.html</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  The primary sense of belonging
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  of a scholar in her research activities is with the disciplinary
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  community of which she thinks herself a part... It certainly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  is not with the institution. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>That may or may not be the case, but in any case it is irrelevant to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the question of which is the more promising route to open-access. Our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>primary sense of belonging may be with our family, our community,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>our creed, our tribe, or even our species. But our rewards (research
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>grant funding and overheads, salaries, postdocs and students attracted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to our research, prizes and honors) are intertwined and shared with our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>institutions (our employers) and not our disciplines (which are often
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>in fact the locus of competition for those same rewards!)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Therefore, if you want to fill

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But the question is whether this &quot;aggregation&quot; needs to be the &quot;feeding&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; Such a faculty member faces several time-consuming problems. He or

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>for existing (and unchanged) publishing habits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; Faculty are typically best at creating new
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; knowledge, not maintaining the record of this process of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; creation. Worse still, this faculty member must not only manage
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; content but must manage a dissemination system such as a personal Web
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; site, playing the role of system administrator (or the manager of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; someone serving as a system administrator).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  There are lot of ways in which to maintain a web site or to get

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Agreed. And uploading it into a departmental OAI Eprints Archive is

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; Over the past few years, this has ceased to be a reasonable activity
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; for most amateurs; software complexity, security risks, backup
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; requirements, and other problems have generally relegated effective
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; operation of Web sites to professionals who can exploit economies of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; scale, and who can begin each day with a review of recently issued
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; security patches.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  These are technical concerns. When you operate a linux box
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  on the web you simply fire up a script that will download
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  the latest version. That is easy enough. Most departments
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  have separate web operations. Arguing for one institutional
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  archive for digital contents is akin to calling for a single web
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  site for an institution. The diseconomies of scale of central
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  administration impose other types of costs that the ones that it was to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  reduce. The secret is to find a middle way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I couldn't quite follow all of this. The bottom line is this: The free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Eprints.org software (for example) can be installed within a few days. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>can then be replicated to handle all the departmental or research group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>archives a university wants, with minimal maintenance time or costs. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>rest is just down to self-archiving, which takes a few minutes for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>first paper, and even less time for subsequent papers (as the repeating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>metadata -- author, institution, etc., can be &quot;cloned&quot; into each new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>deposit template). An institution may wish to impose an institutional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;look&quot; on all of its separate eprints archives; but apart from that,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>they can be as autonomous and as distributed and as many as desired:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>OAI-interoperability works locally just as well as it does globally.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; Today, our faculty time is being wasted, and expended ineffectively,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; on system administration activities and content curation. And,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; because system administration is ineffective, it places our
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; institutions at risk: because faculty are generally not capable of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; responding to the endless series of security exposures and patches,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; our university networks are riddled with vulnerable faculty machines
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>cl&gt; intended to serve as points of distribution for scholarly works.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  This is the fight many faculty face every day, where they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  want to innovate scholarly communication, but someone
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  in the IT department does not give the necessary permission
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  for network access...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I don't think I need to get into this. It's not specific to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>self-archiving, and a tempest in a teapot as far as that is concerned. An
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>efficient system can and will be worked out once there is an effective
