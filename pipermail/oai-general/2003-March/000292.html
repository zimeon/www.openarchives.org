The question of taxonomic classification sets and version-control for
Open Archives is a technical one, so I will not presume to comment on it
except from the point of view of the potential *users* of one particular
kind of Archive Content, namely, unrefereed preprints and refereed
postprints of research papers from one or many or all disciplines: This
-- in the google-age of boolean inverted full-text searchability --
does not require a detailed a-priori taxonomy, as book metadata or the
metadata for other kinds of material might. A fairly general sorting by
discipline should suffice.

&gt;<i> ...the service provider can provide an 
</I>&gt;<i> interface for potential data providers to self-register.
</I>
I hope that once the number and contents of Open-Access Eprint Archives
for research preprints and postprints have scaled up toward something
closer to universality, the simple metadata descriptors &quot;pre-refereeing
preprint&quot; and &quot;refereed journal article&quot; plus perhaps &quot;discipline name&quot;
will be enough to guide relevant service-providers in automatically
harvesting their relevant metadata. Multiple self-registration seems a
tedious and unnecessary constraint. (Possibly a master-registry of valid
institutions and disciplinary archives will also help, but may not be
necessary unless commercial spamming invades this sector too.)

&gt;<i> what remains a difficult problem, however, is how to recreate the 
</I>&gt;<i> metadata used by the service provider as its native format. so, for a 
</I>&gt;<i> typical example, if arXiv classifies items using a specific set 
</I>&gt;<i> structure, this is certainly not going to be the default for an 
</I>&gt;<i> institutional archive. does the service provider automatically or 
</I>&gt;<i> manually reclassify? or does it not allow browsing by categories? 
</I>
Worrying about &quot;recreating the categories&quot; in this boolean full-text age
is, I believe, a waste of time (for research preprints/postprints). Just
harness google's harvested full-text to your engine's search capability,
if it is incapable of contending with boolean full-text search on its
own. (Manual reclassification! Heaven forfend! Don't bother classifying
this material in the first place, beyond the simplest of first-cuts,
such as discipline. Any further classification should be algorithmic and
text-data-driven, not manual.)

&gt;<i> in either event, the quality of the metadata from the perspective of the 
</I>&gt;<i> service provider may be an impetus for potential users to want to 
</I>&gt;<i> replicate their effort rather than rely on the automated submission from 
</I>&gt;<i> their own institutions ... this needs more thought ...
</I>
Again, I speak only for research preprints/postprints, but please let's
not inject any further credibility into the notion that self-archiving
author/institutions will also have to self-advertise by multiple
self-archiving of the same paper. Surely that is one headache that
OAI-interoperability should eradicate from the planet! Self-archiving
itself is self-advertising (and effort) enough. Please let us not
now -- when the momentum is still not big enough -- saddle would-be
self-archivers with needless extra worries, and tasks!
