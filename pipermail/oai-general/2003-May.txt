Subject: [OAI-general] CYCLADES prototype available via Web.
Message-ID: <p05200f09badec945858b@[146.48.85.73]>

We are pleased to announce the availability of the CYCLADES (beta 
version) system, accessible via Web at the address


http://calliope.ics.forth.gr:7007/Cyclades/LoginForm.html

where you can get quickly into CYCLADES.


CYCLADES supports you in searching and managing electronic documents 
from a large number of digital libraries. The system provides you 
with a comprehensive set of functions that enable communities to 
share their results from browsing digital libraries compliant with 
the 'Open Archives Initiative' ( OAI -- http://www.openarchives.org) 
standard.


 From the technical point of view, CYCLADES consist of the following 
federation of independent but interoperable services characterized by 
the following key features:

Access: harvest-based information gathering, plus indexing and 
storage of gathered information in a local database. You can tell 
CYCLADES to harvest your archive. too.


Collection: mechanisms for dynamically structuring the overall 
information space into meaningful (from some community's perspective) 
collections.


Search and Browse: to support the users in formulating queries and 
develops plans for their evaluation.

Filtering: to support information filtering on the basis of 
implicitly acquired individual user profiles, and profiles of the 
working communities the user belongs to. User and community profiles 
are automatically inferred by monitoring the user behavior.

Recommendation: to provide recommendations about new published 
articles within a working community, recommendation of users, 
collections and communities. The choice about what recommendations to 
send and to whom is based on both the user and the working community 
profiles.

Collaborative Work: to support collaboration between members of 
communities and project groups by providing functionality for 
creating shared working spaces referencing users' own documents, 
collections, recommendations, related links, textual annotations, 
ratings, etc.


We highly recommend to read  the "CYCLADES Quick Start", which 
provides you a very short introduction to the system. The quick start 
is available from the login page, as well as within the CYCLADES 
system.


 From the login page you can find also a questionnaire. With your 
help, we hope to provide a better service to the OAI community.

Sincerly,

	-The CYCLADES consortium.


CYCLADES is a R&D project from 1 November 2000 to 31 August 2003,
supported by the IST Programme of the European Commission (project 
no. IST-2000-25456).

Subject: [OAI-general] DSpace 1.1 Released
Message-ID: <40700B4C02ABD5119F00009027876644EA38D6@hplex1.hpl.hp.com>

We are pleased to announce the availibilty of the new 1.1 release of DSpace. This release contains many new features, among them advanced search capabilities, improved unicode handling, and OAI-PMH resumption token support. Also numerous bugs identified since the previous release have been fixed, and the documentation has been updated.


You may download the code and documentation from the DSpace page at
sourceforge:

        http://sourceforge.net/projects/dspace

Be sure to get the updated documentation, since it describes the upgrade procedure that must be performed for the new release to operate on existing DSpace installations. Please report any problems to the sourceforge mail list:

        dspace-tech@lists.sourceforge.net

We would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of the DSpace community in reporting bugs, release testing, and supporting other adopters, as well as the excellent work from HP Labs and MIT developers in improving the DSpace platform.

Subject: [OAI-general] An OAI implementation of the NASA Technical Report Server (NTRS)
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.10.10305281641360.1693-100000@cirrus.cs.odu.edu>

All,

The NASA Technical Report Server (NTRS; http://ntrs.nasa.gov/) has been
reimplemented and now uses the OAI-PMH. The OAI-based version replaces the
former distributed-searching based NTRS.  NTRS is a public service that
provides access to "unclassified, unlimited" NASA-authored scientific and
technical information.  In addition, NTRS also harvests from a select
number of non-NASA OAI repositories.  In total, NTRS holds > 540k metadata
records.

NTRS is also an OAI-PMH aggregator and re-exports its holdings.  The
baseURL for NTRS is http://ntrs.nasa.gov/.

The development of NTRS was sponsored by the NASA Scientific and Technical
Information Program Office.  For additional information, please contact me
or JoAnne Rocker (Joanne.Rocker@nasa.gov).

regards,

Michael
