ELPUB 2006: Digital Spectrum: Integrating Technology and Culture 10th
International Conference on Electronic Publishing
14 to 16 June 2006, Bansko (Bulgaria)

http://www.elpub.net  <elpub2006@elpub.net>

*** Deadlines for submission in all categories: November 21st 2005 ***

The ELPUB 2006 conference will keep the tradition of the nine previous
international conferences on electronic publishing, held in the United
Kingdom (in 1997 and 2001), Hungary (1998), Sweden (1999), Russia (2000),
the Czech Republic (2002), Portugal (2003), Brazil (2004) and Belgium
(2005), which is to bring together researchers, lecturers, librarians,
developers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, managers, users and all those
interested on issues regarding electronic publishing in widely differing
contexts. These include the human, cultural, economic, social,
technological, legal, commercial and other relevant aspects that such an
exciting theme encompasses.

Three distinguished features of this conference are: broad scope of topics
which creates a unique atmosphere of active exchange and learning about
various aspects of electronic publishing;  combination of general and
technical tracks; and a condensed procedure of submission, revision and
publication of proceedings which guarantees presentations of most recent
work.
ELPUB 2006 offers a variety of activities, such as workshops, tutorials,
panel debates etc. Thus, the conference attendees will benefit from:

        -   The communication of scientific papers specially prepared for
the conference;
            all papers are to be reviewed and accepted by the international
ELPUB Programme Committee;
        -   Workshops and tutorials that aim to provide opportunity for
attendants to update themselves in
             topics of high interest within this community of experts;
        -   Plenary sessions that aim to summarise the main ideas
presented and discussed
            during the presentation of the conference papers;
        -   Panel debates on selected topics; possible topics include news
item publishing
             or new methods, including Open Access, for publishing
scientific literature;
        -   Demonstration sessions and presentation of posters.

Announcement [crossposted]

First Workshop on Eprints in Library and Information Science

22 October, 2005 from 13:45 to 19:00
Council Chamber, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland

The workshop takes place right after the CERN workshop on Innovations
in Scholarly Communication OAI4 http://oai4.web.cern.ch/OAI4/. It
is sponsored by CERN, CILEA and the Polytechnic University of Valencia.
The meeting is followed by a reception. 

The workshop is for activists, friends and folks who want to find out
more about the E-LIS eprints archive for Library and Information
Science (LIS), at http://eprints.rclis.org.  E-LIS was formed in 2003
to further the open archiving of papers in LIS and related fields. It
is an open-access international eprints archive maintained by
volunteers. It has grown spectacularly well. At the time of writing
almost 3000 eprints have been archived.

At the workshop the E-LIS community will discuss technical details of
E-LIS and organizational models for the E-LIS community. Outsiders
will find it interesting to see how a really successful open archive
works.  Some efforts that are related to E-LIS will also be discussed.
This workshop will be an important contribution to the development of
open archiving within LIS scholarly communication.

Registration for this event is free, but limited to to the first 150
people. See the workshop web site at 

http://www.aepic.it/conf/index.php?cf=4 

for further details and online registration.

The series of Cern Workshop has established itself as one of the
premier meetings on Open Access in Europe. The 2005 Programme reflects
a wide spectrum of interest in the Open Access movement, with papers
and workshops to interest librarians, funders, academics and technical
specialists.

Subject: [OAI-general] Manuscripts databases and OAI
Message-ID: <s3313e57.074@mail.kb.nl>

-- With apologies for cross-posting --

Dear Colleagues,

The Consortium of European Research Libraries (CERL, www.cerl.org) has
set up a project for developing a federated search facility for
manuscripts. One of the options now being worked on is using the
technique of harvesting through the OAI protocol. 
In order to make a recommendation on how to proceed after the project
phase I would like to know a bit more about how many manuscripts
databases (both with and without images) support harvesting through
OAI.
I am hoping you could help me with this.
Those of you involved with manuscript databases I would like to ask
the
following three questions:
- do you support searching by Z39.50 or SRU, or harvesting through
OAI?
- what kind of material does your database contain (period, spatial
coverage, number of records)?
- might you, in principal, be interested in taking part in an
international federated search facility?

I thank you in advance for your input in this small investigation,
best wishes,

Liesbeth Oskamp
