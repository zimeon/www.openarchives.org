Message-ID: <20110907053529.GA19341@openlib.org>


  On behalf of the Open Bibilographic Working Group of the Open
  Knowledge Foundation, I would like to bring your attention to the
  Principles on Open Bibliographic data at

http://openbiblio.net/principles/

  The group continues to offer the opportunity, for both individuals
  and groups, to sign up to the principles.


  Cheers,
