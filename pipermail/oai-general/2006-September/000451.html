2nd International Conference on Open Repositories
&quot;Achieving Interoperability in an Open World&quot;
San Antonio, Texas  USA
January 23-27, 2007
www.openrepositories.org

***Submission of Extended Abstracts and Advance Registration for
***Open Repositories 2007 is now available at the conference website.

Open Repositories 2007 will continue the very successful format of
Open User Group meetings for DSpace, Fedora, and EPrints, followed by
general conference sessions that cover cross-cutting and overarching issues.
This year, the user groups will partition their programs into Plenary,
Technical Issues, and Management Issues, and the partitions will be
staggered so that IT directors can attend all plenary sessions and
technical staff can attend all technical sessions. The User Group
meetings are open to all attendees.

The general conference program will be organized around the following
themes:
     * Open access and strategic context (social and technical) for repositories
     * Value-  added services to enhance particular repositories
     * Achieving interoperability for repositories
     * Repositories and IT infrastructure
     * Open source software
     * Digital preservation
     * Use cases for repositories
     * Modeling for digital objects and repositories
     * Management and policy issues
     * Metrics

OR07 is pleased to announce the keynote speakers for the general
conference. The opening keynote for the general conference will be
given by James L. Hilton, Vice President and Chief Information Officer at
the University of Virginia. The closing keynote will be given by Tony Hey,
Corporate Vice President for Technical Computing at Microsoft.

Please see the website (www.openrepositories.org) for more details.
