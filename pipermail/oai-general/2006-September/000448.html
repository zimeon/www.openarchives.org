First Call for Papers
11th International Conference on Electronic Publishing
13 to 15 June 2007, Vienna (Austria)

<A HREF="http://www.elpub.net">http://www.elpub.net</A>

Openness in Digital Publishing: Awareness, Discovery and Access
 
&quot;Openness&quot; is a broad philosophical as well as technical tenet that
underlies much of the innovation in the creation and consumption of Internet
technologies, which are in turn transforming scholarly communications,
practices and publishing across the disciplines and around the world.
 
ELPUB 2007 is devoted to examining the full spectrum of &quot;openness&quot; in
digital publishing, from open source applications for content creation to
open distribution of content, and open standards to facilitate sharing and
open access. We welcome papers with theoretical analysis, description of
models and services, or new and innovative technical results on:

* Publishing models, tools, services and roles
* Digital publication value chain
* Multilingual and multimodal interfaces
* Services and technology for specific user communities, media, and content
* Interoperability and scalability
* Middleware infrastructure to facilitate awareness and discovery
* Personalisation technologies (e.g. social tagging, folksonomies, RSS,
  microformats)
* Metadata creation, usage and interoperability
* Semantic web issues
* Security, privacy and copyright issues
* Digital reservation, contents authentication
* Recommendations, guidelines, standards

ABOUT ELPUB
 
The ELPUB 2007 conference will keep the tradition of the ten previous
international conferences on electronic publishing, held in the United
Kingdom (in 1997 and 2001), Hungary (1998), Sweden (1999), Russia (2000),
the Czech Republic (2002), Portugal (2003), Brazil (2004), Belgium (2005)
and Bulgaria (2006), which is to bring together researchers, lecturers,
librarians, developers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, managers, users and all
those interested on issues regarding electronic publishing in widely
differing contexts. These include the human, cultural, economic, social,
technological, legal, commercial and other relevant aspects that such an
exciting theme encompasses.
 
Three distinguished features of this conference are: broad scope of topics
which creates a unique atmosphere of active exchange and learning about
various aspects of electronic publishing; combination of general and
technical issues; and a condensed procedure of submission, revision and
publication of proceedings which guarantees presentations of most recent
work.
         
Conference Location:
Vienna, the capital of Austria, is one of Europe's most fascinating cities
with a rich history and various cultural attractions and reasonable livingcosts. The campus of Vienna University of Technology is located near the
historic downtown of Vienna.
