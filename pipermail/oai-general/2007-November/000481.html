<PRE>
OPEN REPOSITORIES 2008: Deadline 9th Dec 2007 for Papers &amp; Panels
(Calls for Posters and User Group Participation to follow later)
<A HREF="http://www.openrepositories.org/2008">http://www.openrepositories.org/2008</A>

We invite developers, researchers and practitioners to submit papers
describing novel experiences or developments in the construction and
use of digital repositories. Submissions of UP TO 4 pages in length
are requested for review. See the CFP page at the conference site for
submission instructions. Submissions for panel discussions are also
requested.

Repositories are being deployed in a variety of settings (research,
scholarship, learning, science, cultural heritage) and across a range
of scales (subject, national, regional, institutional, project, lab,
personal). The aim of this conference is to address the technical,
managerial, practical and theoretical issues that arise from diverse
applications of repositories in the increasingly pervasive information
environment.

A programme of papers, panel discussions, poster presentations,
workshops, tutorials and developer coding sessions will bring together
all the key stakeholders in the field. Open source software community
meetings for the major platforms (EPrints, DSpace and Fedora) will
also provide opportunities to advance and co-ordinate the development
of repository installations across the world.
