Call for Abstracts

1st European Workshop on the use of Digital Object Repository Systems in
Digital Libraries (DORSDL)

<A HREF="http://www.lib.uoa.gr/dorsdl/">http://www.lib.uoa.gr/dorsdl/</A>

September 21, 2006, Alicante, Spain


Organised in conjunction with the 10th European Conference On Research
And Advanced Technology For Digital Libraries 
(ECDL 2006 <A HREF="http://www.ecdl2006.org">http://www.ecdl2006.org</A>)


The goal of the workshop is to bring together European developers and
users of digital object repository systems in the context of digital
libraries. A number of issues that are in the scope of the workshop are
the following:

    * Models for digital object management, handling and manipulation.
    * Representation and manipulation of heterogeneous and complex
digital content.
    * Collection management capabilities
    * Workflows, cataloguing, batch ingestions, etc: critital &quot;every
day&quot; DL development issues that the system facilitates
    * Means of access, integration and interoperability of digital
objects (Web Services, OAI, etc).
    * Examples of digital object repository systems at work in digital
libraries.
    * Needs and experiences of users of digital object repository
systems.
    * Evaluations and comparisons of digital object repository systems
with respect to extensibility, flexibility, scalability, preservation,
etc.

Some technical aspects of the workshop topic area are:

    * digital object models, behaviours, profiles, and prototypes
    * tools for managing and delivering digital content
    * multiple views of each digital object
    * relationships among digital objects
    * web services for access and management
    * support for Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting
    * versioning and audit trail

A list of Digital object repository systems and / or digital library
systems of interest is provided below:

    * FEDORA, Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture
    * DSpace, Open Source Digital Repository System
    * Greenstone, A Platform for Distributed Digital Library
Applications
    * EPrints, Eprints Open Access Repository
    * aDORe, A Modular and Standards-Based Digital Object Repository
    * OpenDLib, A Digital Library Management System Based on a Powerful
Document Model
    * DAFFODIL, Distributed Agents for User-Friendly Access of Digital
Libraries
    * MILOS, A Multimedia Content Management System for Digital Library
Applications

Note that none of the above lists should be considered restrictive in
any manner. The workshop aims to cover a variety of practical digital
library development issues and how their resolution can (or cannot) be
carried out in the context of the digital object repository at hand.


Submission of Extended Abstracts:

Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts, which should be
written in English and prepared according to the Springer LNCS format
guidelines (2 pages maximum). Authors are invited to send their

by April 30. Please, note that the submission implies the willingness of
at least one of the manuscript authors to register and present the
paper. Accepted contributions will be published on the workshop's web
site.
