Message-ID: <48DA63BE.7020704@cs.cornell.edu>

The ORE Challenge at RepoCamp 2008 received five compelling entries showcasing 
the value and potential of OAI-ORE. I encourage everyone to take a look at the 
screen casts and to soak up the good ideas:

Kudos to all entrants but there can be only one winner: the winning entry is 
"OREsome". Creator Ross McFarlane will receive a cash prize from Microsoft 
Research.

Cheers,
