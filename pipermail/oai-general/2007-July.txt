Message-ID: <469B524C.40000@ccsd.cnrs.fr>

Hi all,

At OAI5, Simeon Warner was kind enough to mention the forthcoming book on OAI-PMH written by Tim Cole and I. Since several people came
afterwards to request to be informed when it was published, I'm taking this opportunity to announce that it is now available.


Cole, Timothy W. and Muriel Foulonneau (2007). /Using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting/. 
Third Millennium Cataloging, ed. Susan Lazinger and Sheila Intner. Westport, CT: Libraries Unlimited. ISBN-13: 978-1-59158-280-9.
 Online scholarly publishing is revolutionizing scholarly communication, and the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) is 
among those protocols leading the way in the transformation process. OAI enables access to Web-accessible material by 
harvesting (or collecting) the metadata descriptions of the records in an archive so that services can be built using 
metadata from many archives. Through a series of case studies, Cole and Foulonneau guide the reader through the 
process of conceiving, implementing and maintaining an OAI-compliant repository. Its applicability to both 
institutional archives and discipline based aggregators are covered, with equal attention paid to the technical and 
organizational aspects of creating and maintaining such repositories.

Subject: [OAI-general] DLF Aquifer MODS Guidelines Levels of Adoption now
	available
Message-ID: <0E34DA4C7FFF7A459DFCEE208B739D2B01A380EF@iu-mssg-mbx101.ads.iu.edu>

(This message is being sent to multiple lists - please excuse any
duplication.)

The Digital Library Federation Aquifer Metadata Working Group is proud
to announce the release of the DLF Aquifer MODS Guidelines Levels of
Adoption <http://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/confluence/x/q24>.

The Levels of Adoption document is intended to supplement the Digital
Library Federation / Aquifer Implementation Guidelines for Shareable
MODS Records
<http://www.diglib.org/aquifer/dlfmodsimplementationguidelines_finalnov2
006.pdf>, released in November 2006 under the auspices of the DLF
Aquifer initiative <http://www.diglib.org/aquifer/>. The Shareable MODS
Guidelines represent a record-centric view of Aquifer's goals, whereas
it is often helpful to set priorities for metadata creation with a user-
and use-centric view. The newly-released Levels of Adoption document
describes five general categories of user functionality that are likely
to be supported by following specific recommendations from the
Guidelines. It attempts to provide additional guidance to MODS
implementers in the planning process by documenting what sorts of
functionality is possible when certain elements of the Guidelines are
followed.

These documents, together with an FAQ for implementation (forthcoming -
stay tuned!), were written primarily to assist institutions preparing
metadata for aggregation via the DLF Aquifer initiative, but the Working
Group expects they could also be useful in preparing metadata for other
aggregations, or for using MODS in a local environment. Comments on the
Levels of Adoption are welcome, and can be sent to any Working Group
member. Contact information for Working Group members is available from
the Levels of Adoption page.

Subject: [OAI-general] E-SciDR Study Public Consultation on Digital
	Repositories
Message-ID: <003f01c7cde7$bea4cf80$0900a8c0@PHILIP>

Dear OAI Community,

OAI is fundamental to the discovery and efficient use of digital materials
held in digital repositories, and forms a vital element in the
infrastructure for repositories. You are therefore invited to respond to a
public consultation questionnaire issued by the European Commission,
inviting views to inform the development of e-science digital repositories
in Europe.  The letter of invitation is copied below, and the questionnaire
is available at
http://ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/ipm/forms/dispatch?form=eSciDR.

The consultation is part of the e-SciDR study to help the Commission to
promote further the use of digital repositories in Europe
(http://www.e-scidr.eu/).  To this end the study will inform the senior
decision makers in the Commission on the current status of digital
repositories, on the views of all stakeholders in repositories, and propose
policy options to the Commission.  Thus the study will inform how funding
will be directed to repository development.

The study has the active interest of key institutions and individuals
involved in OAI.

With apologies for any cross-posting,

Philip Lord,

Director, Digital Archiving Consultancy

 

The Commission's invitation; 

"May I invite you, to contribute to the development of a knowledge society
and digital infrastructure in Europe, by taking part in the European
Commission's online public consultation on e-Science Digital Repositories
which is available at
http://ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/ipm/forms/dispatch?form=eSciDR. 

This consultation forms a key part of the e-SciDR (http://www.e-scidr.eu/)
study funded by the Commission into repositories holding digital data and
publications for use in the sciences (in the widest sense, encompassing
disciplines from the humanities and social sciences to the life sciences and
physical sciences). 

Your answers will help identify needs, priorities and opportunities which
the European Union, through the Commission, can help address and drive
forward in the FP7 Capacity Programme and will provide an important input to
developing future policy initiatives.

All answers will be strictly confidential and anonymised.

If you would like to receive a summary of the consultation results, please
tick the corresponding box on the questionnaire."
