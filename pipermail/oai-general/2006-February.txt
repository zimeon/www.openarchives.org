STARGATE (Static Repository Gateway and Toolkit:
Enabling small publishers to participate in OAI-PMH-based services)

The STARGATE project is exploring the use of static repositories as a 
means of exposing publisher metadata to OAI-based disclosure, discovery 
and alerting services within the JISC Information Environment and 
beyond. Such an approach allows smaller publishers to participate in
OAI-based services without having to implement and maintain an full
repository.

The project is implementing a series of static repositories of publisher
metadata, and will demonstrate the interoperability of the exposed
metadata through harvesting and cross-searching via a static repository
gateway, and conduct a critical evaluation of the static repository
approach with publishers and service providers.

STARGATE is a project funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee
(JISC) and based in the Centre for Digital Library Research at the
University of Strathclyde.

The journals participating are:
o Journal of Digital Information http://jodi.tamu.edu/
o Information Research http://informationr.net/ir/
o Library and Information Research http://www.lirg.org.uk/lir/lir.htm
o Information Scotland
http://www.slainte.org.uk/publications/serials/infoscot/contents.html

The PerX project (http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/perx/ based at Heriot-Watt
university) is also participating.

Although the project will initially focus on e-journals, the static
repository approach also lends itself to other types of publishing,
including e-books, e-learning materials and other digital resources
