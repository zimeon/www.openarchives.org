Message-ID: <5.0.2.1.0.20010402113319.00a76030@pop-hub.strath.ac.uk>

This is a spin-off from the recent debate over discipline-based versus 
institution based archives, where Stevan Harnad mentioned that over 100 
sites are trying out the eprints software. I wondered how they are doing?

We haven't got very far at Strathclyde - just read some of the papers, 
downloaded the documentation and looked at the discipline-based archives. 
We hope to start a small trial over the next few weeks. It's a little 
premature, but we already see a number of issues, for instance, how best to 
classify the archive, what metadata to use, how to persuade people to 
participate, especially our staff in disciplines where there is already a 
functioning archive.

I'd consequently be very interested in a) looking at examples if anyone's 
got anything up and running, and b) discussing experiences and approaches. 
(The latter should probably be restricted to the non-technical as we have 
the eprints-tech list for that sort of thing.)

Has anyone any examples and experiences to discuss?

It's very hard to get a good measure of how many people are running your 
software. The New Zealand Digital Library's Greenstone library, for example, 
has hundreds and hundreds of downloads:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12123

but we know that not nearly that number are actually running the software.

as per Stuart's previous comments, downloads don't equal full up
usage.  I've d/l'd a copy of eprints, and I have good intentions of
investigating it, but...

my question to you: if you certain groups already have functioning
archives, consider writing an OAI layer around their existing archive /
process.  IMO, the real beauty of OAI is that you don't have to rip out an
existing software package (and one that users are probably already
comfortable with) and replace it with the latest, greatest software du
jour.  Users usually don't have that level of enthusiasm for shifting
infrastructure.  And its generally not tough to scrape enough metadata to
populate some of the more interesting DC fields.

On the other hand, if you're establishing an archive where there was none
(or the people are clamoring for improvements), something like eprints is
the obvious choice.  

bottom line:  have you considered wrapping your existing archive?

regards,

Michael

Here at the Cornell Library another librarian and I have written an 
internal proposal to create an OAI layer around Cornell's National Spatial 
Data Infrastructure (NSDI) clearinghouse node (CUGIR; see: 
http://cugir.mannlib.cornell.edu/). For various reasons, we decided to 
create the Dublin Core versions of the FGDC metadata in the OCLC 
Cooperative Online Resource Catalog (CORC; see: http://corc.oclc.org/). We 
will be exporting these DC records back out of CORC into an OAI server. If 
our experiment works, populating the OAI server will become just another 
step in the existing CUGIR workflow.

This is what we plan to do:

1. Convert the CUGIR FGDC records to MARC using an existing conversion tool 
(http://cuadra.nwrc.gov/converter/)
2. Import the CUGIR MARC version into CORC; add value to the CORC versions 
by imposing authority control on terminology. (Leave the records in OCLC's 
CORC/WorldCat to facilitate resource discovery)
4. Export the MARC version from CORC into the Cornell Library catalog
5. Export the DC version from CORC into our new CUGIR OAI server

see also: http://www.fgdc.gov/

If there are any members of this list interested in the specifics of our 
project, email me and I'll send you a copy of the proposal, which includes 
justification for our approach.

Adam,

The DC version that CORC produces on export isn't properly encoded for the
DC namespace. I encountered this problem when I used CORC as the basis for a
MARC to Dublin Core translator (see
http://alcme.oclc.org:4342/marc2dc/index.html). My solution was to take the
CORC DC and run it through an XSL translator. I've attached the XSL
stylesheet. Perhaps you will find it useful. If you have questions, contact
me.

Today's (April 26) Nature magazine http://www.nature.com/nature/
contains the following article on the Self-Archiving Initiative:

(the above is the preprint: official version is at nature.com).

Nature is also currently running an on-line debate on
"Future e-access to the primary literature" at:

This includes the following commentary by me:

and

Subject: [OAI-general] questionnaire
Message-ID: <p05010400b712edbcde2c@[146.48.85.73]>

Dear sirs,

The CYCLADES consortium aims to elicit potential users' views on the
functionality and services provided by the CYCLADES environment. A
questionnaire has been devised for this purpose. We would like to ask
you to take a few moments and familiarize yourself with the description
and purpose of CYCLADES and also fill out the user requirements questionnaire
at the following location:

http://sappho.ics.forth.gr:5000/User_Requirements/questionnaire.html


Your effort in filling out this questionnaire is greatly appreciated.
This questionnaire has been devised for the elicitation of user requirements
for the project CYLADES (IST-2000-25456). A brief description of the
project and its objectives is given below as well as at the aforementioned
web site.

Sincerely,

The CYCLADES Consortium,





Project Description

The main objective of CYCLADES (http://www.iei.pi.cnr.it/cyclades/) is to
develop advanced Internet accessible services to support scholars both
individually and as members of networked communities when interacting with
large interdisciplinary electronic (e-print) archives}. CYCLADES aims at
supporting the transition of e-print systems into genuine building blocks
of a transformed scholarly communication model by developing a set of
leading-edge technologies providing innovative methods for information access,
dissemination, sharing and collaborative work.

The proposed open archives environment consists of two components: the
archives and the services. To the former  contribute the Open
Archives initiative (OAI). CYCLADES will base the development of the service
environment on these specifications. In particular, a core set of cross-archive
value-added services will be developed to constitute a federation of
independent but interoperable services. The Service Environment will provide
OAi compliant functionality.  The CYCLADES services comprise the following:

Search and Browse Service: develops plans for the execution of user
queries. An ad-hoc or a profile-based user query will be decomposed into
more simple sub-queries to be sent to the Access Service for execution.
The results of the sub-queries are fused and returned to the user.
A browse facility is also supported.

Collection Service: provides mechanisms for dynamically building meaningful
collections.

Personalization Service: supports personalization of information
access on the basis of individual user profiles and of profiles of scholarly
communities to which users belong.

Recommendation Service: provides recommendations to satisfy information needs
of a user based on ratings provided by other users or groups.

Collaborative Work Service: supports collaboration between members of virtual
communities. Community working areas are created to use the OAi content in
collaborative work.
