Dear OAI-General subscribers,

I am happy to announce the 13th edition of our annual summer
school on the digital library:
www.tilburguniversity.nl/ticer/08carte/.

This year, we have two course modules which relate to OAI.

* Module 4 (Libraries - Partners in Research and Open Access) offers
presentations by David Prosser (worldwide OAI developments), Peter
Murray-Rust (repositories and research data), Vanessa Proudman
(populating repositories), and Martin Reid (legal aspects of
repositories).

* Module 5b (Put Yourself in the DRIVER's Seat - Practical Training
for Building a European Repository Network) aims at repository
managers or data aggregators who are (or are considering to become)
part of the DRIVER community. It assists them to implement the DRIVER
Guidelines and to integrate with the DRIVER community.

Also, Herbert Van de Sompel will lecture on OAI-ORE in module 2.

Kind regards,

Jola Prinsen
