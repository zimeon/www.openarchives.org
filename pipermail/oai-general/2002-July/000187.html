<PRE>A recent report on the emergence of 'superarchives' of institutional 
scholarly output in the Chronicle of Higher Education pointed out that
'new 
search tools would need to be developed to make full use of the (OAI) 
metadata tags' +AFs-see ref. below+AF0-. As list readers know, OAI repositories
are 
already searchable using services such as Arc, OAIster and My.OAI.

A new OAI search service goes further. As well as OAI metadata, Citebase

harvests reference lists from the largest OAI archives such as arXiv,
which 
it uses to present citation-ranked search. For users, Citebase allows 
results to be ordered by selectable criteria, such as how many times a 
paper has been cited in the searchable literature.

OAI recognises that effective search services are vital in promoting
wider 
use of OAI repositories. Authors of papers in open archives can now
benefit 
from visibility and impact in the same way as they do from journal
publication.

First we have to assure that such services will be useful and usable to
all 
academic users, so we are asking the OAI community to try Citebase and 
comment on it. To guide you a Web form takes you through a short
exercise 
highlighting the principal features. The form can be found (via
redirect) at <A HREF="http://citebase.eprints.org/survey/">http://citebase.eprints.org/survey/</A>

In future Citebase need not be restricted to a few archives but will
also 
cover the emerging 'superarchives'.

Citebase is produced as part of the Open Citation project, funded by the

Joint NSF - JISC International Digital Libraries Research Programme.
