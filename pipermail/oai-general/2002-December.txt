I agree completely with Mark Doyle and was not (in my reply to a query
from a user) venturing to suggest policy. I was trying to explain to
the user why one could not keep updating the same archived paper
(whether metadata or text). I leave it to Mark, Chris and the experts
to pick the optimal technical solution. (Chris?)

Mark suggested that an archived article should be a persisting object,
with a persisting identifier. That seems reasonable. Now if there have
been several successive versions of a paper (which the author wants to
consider as successive versions rather than new papers), then it also
seems reasonable that the archive should link all the successive
versions and point to the latest one by default.

All the prior versions are preserved, and accessible (unless the archive
has a policy allowing withdrawal -- a policy that should not be
encouraged).

It is the user's or citer's responsibility to specify which version they
have used/cited, if there are more than one. That will become part of
good scholarship, just as spelling the author's name correctly is.

So we need both unique identifier for a generic paper and a unique
identifier for a specific draft of that paper.

Correct. It refers to a specific draft, usually with a calendar date and
some other identifying features.

I mostly agree. But this seems to be covered by providing unique version
identifies; it does not prevent the Archive from defaulting to the most
recent version -- while offering the earlier versions too.

It might be making a subtle difference in the view people are taking on
this whether they are thinking of the Archive as a centralized one
(rather like a journal) or a distributed institutional one (rather like
author-provided reprints). It is conceivable that different drafts of a
paper will be in different archives. Those distributed versions too,
need to be trackable and integrated. My technical inexpertise leaves me
unable to propose how to do this, but it is the hardest-case scenario,
and the one we should aim to cover, eventually. Assuming it will all
be in one central archive is probably unrealistic (and unnecessary, in the
spirit of distributed OAI archiving and interoperability).

To my layman's ear it sounds as if every version of a paper will need a
unique version identifier, and in addition, there will need to be some
interoperable ways of integrating different versions as being different
versions of the same paper. The new scholarship will be, at the gross
level, concerned only with citing the generic paper (without worrying
about version fine-tuning), but the careful scholars need to have the
option of specifying the version too, uniquely, for those cases where
it matters.

It cuts both ways. Yes, authors should not start archiving willy-nilly
every raw draft and every afterthought. But they should not feel
constrained in doing corrections and updates whenever they are needed
too. Authors should know, though, that from the moment they place a draft
into a public open-access archive, it may be read, cited, and pointed to
-- that specific draft -- in perpetuum. That is part of what it means
to have archived something publicly.

I'm sure scholars will easily get a sense for this, as they have for
everything else. In the beginning some will fumble and treat the
archive as labile first drafts or lapidary touch-me-nots, but experience
and feedback will calibrate everyone's practice and reflexes. The
Archives just have to make sure they do not pre-judge or short-circuit
any important options a priori.

OED's definition was written before the Internet. One can certainly
write on a draft, prominently "This is just a temporary draft, and will
be revised." One can even add "Please do not quote or cite." But if you
put that on the Web, not only will some people nevertheless quote,
cite (and link), but the draft is not necessarily ever removable, in
principle, even if the original draft and website are removed and the
URL no longer works. Once it is publicly posted, there will not only
be fugitive saved versions downloaded earlier by users, but copies
may well have been mirrored, cached, harvested, and reposted willy-nilly,
persisting till doomsday. This is simply a fact of PostGutenberg life --
and a confusing fact, detrimental to scholarly reliability and rigor,
unless we devise a means of version-identification, tagging and control
that does not rely on people simply looking the other way if someone
writes "this is just a draft."

Just as anything I ever said can be repeated by hearsayers (and taped,
and re-played), so everything I ever wrote can be. If I made only one
copy, and showed it to only one person, I am fairly safe (if I can trust
the person not to repeat any of it to anyone), but it's all down the
slippery slope from there.

Will the self-archivers of preprints be discouraged from self-archiving
after having this very banal fact about human communication and human
nature pointed out to them? (I rather doubt it.)

Disagree in the sense that you don't believe it may be read, cited,
and pointed to in perpretuum (even if it is withdrawn)? Or in the sense
that you don't believe it ought to be?

I think deletion should be a (discouraged but available) option, but
with a persistent tag for the deleted (null) text, as a place-holder for
would-be citers who did read that draft and do want to refer to it (even
against the author's request, and even backed up only by hearsay). The
best corrective for this is to self-archive the updated, corrected draft
too, and have the archive pointers always point to that too, even the
null (deleted) ones. (But I really do think that if someone's draft is
so raw that they would rather it could vanish without a trace, then
perhaps it was too early a draft to post publicly in the first place,
and should only have been emailed to a few trausted colleagues!)

> Maybe not for other professions, but certainly in economics, business,

I am sure this was the practise and expectation in paper days, when
drafts were sent only to specific trusted colleagues, but it is a fact
that public posting on the Web is (like publication) another ball-game
(a bit more like guassian roulette).

That is an option that should be available, but its use should be
strongly discouraged. Better to selectively email the potentially
embarrassing drafts, intended to be forgotten, and self-archive only the
ones one feels one can live with being seen publicly (and potentially
remembered and referred to forever). It is, after all, something of an
antidote to unwelcome citing and quoting to be able to point to the
extant draft and say: "See, it said 'temporary draft, to be revised, do
not cite or quote'...."

(Ceterum censeo: This is all irrelevant to the issue of open access,
which is mainly about open access to the research literature after peer
review. How early a draft one wishes to make openly accessible before
peer review is a matter for the author to decide. But open access should
in general be thought of as being forever.)

With the December deadline it appears that OAI 1.x repositories have been
purged from the OAI web site. May I suggest that a better approach would be
to list _all_ OAI archives that are OAI compliant (be that 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0 -
so few were 0.9 that it is probably immaterial). If necessary, archives that
aren't 2.0 could be greyed, along with a column saying which version they
are.

For myself I can say it is immaterial which version of OAI is implemented,
as long as it is valid XML and has the right content (and I have time to set
up the harvest!). The problem is lack-of-content, not protocol versions.

All the best,

I'm considering adding version control to the files. This is going to be
needed for the oft discussed j-prints (eprints with peer review)

I think for archives like ECS letting the author un-deposit then resubmit is
probably OK, but bad for cogprints. I'm considering adding it as an *option*
which the archive admin can enable/disable.

This is definitely a quality vs. quantity issue. ECS EPrints is already such
a state I don't think it can hurt. Cogprints is another matter.

Suggestions of a perfect(better) solution are more than welcome.

hi Chris

i have tackled some of these problems while designing a peer review 
model/protocol/component as part of the ODL (Open Digital Libraries) 
project.

specifically, i worked on a system with the following features:
- metadata records are linked into a hierarchical management system - 
files are stored independently and linked into the metadata using URLs
- draft versions are linked linearly so that a chain can be established 
- all drafts as retained as OAI-accessible metadata records
- an "authoritative" OAI identifier is maintained for the most current 
record
- the review protocol provides a summary of the status of a record, its 
metadata, its version chain, etc.

for our purposes (aimed at the CSTC and JERIC systems), after an item is 
approved, its metadata is stored in a different archive. thus, the draft 
versions are no longer used and are not "addressable". however, this 
should be possible with a few changes to the model/protocol/software. in 
any event, having a quick look at the stuff i worked on might give you 
some ideas in terms of linking and accessing of resources.

if you are interested in looking over some of the work, you can read the 
appropriate sections of my dissertation:
   http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-11222002-155624/
(see pages 64-77, especially p75)
also, check the ODL website at http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/odl for more 
information, papers, talks, demos, and some software you can play with 
if you really want to :)

hope this is useful ...

ttfn,
----hussein

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.21.0212161718410.16344-100000@ruby.ils.unc.edu>

Hello:

I've been lurking on this list for a bit.

I am a former student of Micheal Nelson's and wrote my master's paper,
which I turned in last month, on OAI and DC Metadata.  Michael suggested
that I post the results to OAI-General.

The link to the paper and the abstract are below.  On the web site, in
addition to the paper itself, I have made available lots o' figures and
tables, most of which were not inserted in the paper itself. 

Link:

Abstract:

Jewel Ward.  A Quantitative Analysis of Dublin Core Metadata Element Set
(DCMES) Usage in Data Providers Registered with the Open Archives
Initiative (OAI).  A Master's paper for the M.S. in
I.S. degree.  November, 2002.  68 pages.  Advisor:  Gregory B. Newby


This research describes an empirical study of how the Dublin Core Metadata
Element Set (DCMES) is used by 100 Data Providers (DPs) registered with
the Open Archives Initiative (OAI).  The research was conducted to
determine whether or not the DCMES is used to its full capabilities.  

Eighty-two of 100 DPs have metadata records available for analysis.  DCMES
usage varies by type of DP.  The average number of Dublin Core elements
per record is eight, with an average of 91,785 Dublin Core elements used
per DP.  Five of the 15 elements of the DCMES are used 71% of the
time.  The results show the DCMES is not used to its fullest extent within
DPs registered with OAI.


Best Regards,

Jewel Ward

Please excuse any duplication.

Call for articles:  Special issue of Library Hi Tech titled:

MARC and Metadata:  Future Developments and Relationships

This is a call for articles for a special issue of Library Hi Tech devoted
to the topic of MARC and metadata standards/initiatives that are attempting
to enhance, exploit, emulate, and/or replace the MARC standard.  This
special issue is especially interested in examining current developments
with MODS, METS, XML MARC, and OAI in these areas, and the issue editor is
looking for experts, developers, and users of these standards to write
articles for the issue.

The deadline for receipt of final articles would be June 31, 2003, and the
issue would probably be published in late 2003/early 2004.  If you are
interested in writing an article, please send a proposal with a title and
short abstract of the content of the article, as well as some information
regarding your expertise and experience with the standard(s) that you plan
to discuss.  Co-authored articles are also encouraged.  If you have any
questions, please contact the special issue editor at:

Subject: [OAI-general] DDQ 1(4) announces a digital preservation solution
Message-ID: <MGEHKILKPBKMHNDAIDAKEEPKDEAA.hgladney@pacbell.net>

DDQ 1(4)at http://home.pacbell.net/hgladney/ddq_1_4.htm continues DDQ’s 2002
emphasis on digital content preservation, identifying what we believe is a
solution to the technical challenges.

We agree with a developing consensus that the migration and preservation
emulation proposals for preserving meaning are flawed.  Next to no-one else
is considering fresh approaches.  This DDQ number announces a series of
articles that propose an approach to secure, meaningful digital preservation
and describe work in progress.

DDQ 1(4) also comments on people's perception that digital resources present
more difficult problems than information on paper—-an opinion that we feel
overlooks facts about the technologies and about people’s growing
expectations.

The technical components of a solution must address four objectives:
1) Ensuring that our descendants can understand and use any information we
preserve.
2) Ensuring that anybody can decide whether saved data can be trusted for
his applications.
3) Replacing human effort by automatic procedures whenever doing so is
feasible.
4) Empowering each information producer to package content and metadata to
minimize what a professional archivist or librarian must do.

Our solution treats the first three objectives economically and is
compatible with almost any deployed digitallibrary software.

DDQ tables of contents continue at http://home.pacbell.net/hgladney/ddq.htm
