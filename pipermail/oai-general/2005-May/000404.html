    Gutteridge wins award for Eprints software   

    Christopher Gutteridge has won the 2005 UKUUG Open Source Award
    <A HREF="http://www.ukuug.org/pr/osa2005.shtml">http://www.ukuug.org/pr/osa2005.shtml</A> 
    for his work on GNU Eprints
    <A HREF="http://software.eprints.org/">http://software.eprints.org/</A> 
    the open-source software for open-access
    archives and repositories. From the University 
    of Southampton press release: 
    <A HREF="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/737">http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/737</A> 
    'UKUUG (UK Unix and Open Systems User Group) has made its 2005 Award
    to Christopher Gutteridge of the School of Electronics and Computer
    Science, University of Southampton, for his work on the Open Archive
    Software: GNU EPrints. Christopher, who has been a systems programmer
    and web developer since 1997, has been developing and supporting
    GNU EPrints 2 package over the last four years. The package is
    now used worldwide in universities and research institutions to
    enable researchers to share their research effectively, via the
    web, and to provide accessibility to scientific findings. &quot;EPrints
    is both a practical tool and the crystallization of a philosophy,&quot;
    said Christopher. &quot;It enables research to be accessible to all, and
    provides the foundation for all academic institutions to create their
    own research repositories.&quot; The School of Electronics and Computer
    Science has been one of the prime movers in the global movement
    towards open access... The University of Southampton is the
    first UK university to announce that it would be establishing its
    own institutional repository and requiring all its academic staff
    to self-archive their research.' Congratulations, Christopher!
