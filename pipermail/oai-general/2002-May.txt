Announcing Perseus Open Archives Initiative Services (6 May 2002)

The Perseus Project is pleased to announce the first release of its Open
Archives Initiative service provider. The Perseus system harvests
registered OAI repositories and incorporates the information into its
search interface (http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor).

Some sample searches: 

- search for "Shakespeare", grouped by collection. Note that not all
resources have web-accessible content.
http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?lookup=Shakespeare;group=collcat;extern=1

- search for "cloning", dynamically clustered by repeated phrases. Note
the different phrases associated with cloning: "molecular cloning",
"amino acid", "quantum information".
http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?lookup=cloning;group=stcluster;extern=1

- search for "Goethe", grouped by matching field. Books by Goethe are
separated from information about Goethe. 
http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?lookup=Goethe;group=fieldcat;extern=1

For documents that are web-accessible, Perseus creates two links: one
directly to the outside page, and one with added Perseus links. As with
texts in Perseus, these links point back to related resources in the
digital library. 

Please send comments to dasmith@perseus.tufts.edu

Subject: [OAI-general] BETA version of OAI-PMH v.2.0
Message-ID: <3CE01928.BBCABA8A@lanl.gov>

Dear,

We are pleased to announce the release of the BETA version of the
OAI-PMH v.2.0:

* The BETA protocol document is available at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm .
* Linked from the protocol document is also a migration document
pointing out the major differences between the experimental 1.0/1.1
version of the protocol and version 2.0, which is released as a stable
specification.
* Also linked from the protocol document are Implementation Guidelines,
covering a broad range of topics related to protocol implementation.

This BETA release comes after 16 months of worldwide experimentation
with version 1.x of the protocol, an 8 month revision process by the
OAI-tech group, and 2 months of alpha testing.  We feel confident about
the quality of the resulting specification.  We encourage discussion of
the specification on the oai-implementers list to help us further
improve the specification. Also, we encourage you to inform the list
about v.2.0BETA conformant data provider implementations, when they
become available.  We expect this to be useful to support other
implementations/migrations.

The full release of the OAI-PMH v.2.0 is expected around the middle of
June 2002.  Up until that time we hope to keep the functionality of the
beta specification stable, restricting changes to textual clarifications
and corrections.

Below, preliminary information is provided regarding OAI-PMH v.2.0
conformant tools that will become available by or soon after June 1st
2002.  They will be listed on the Open Archives website as they become
available.

Message-ID: <706871B20764CD449DB0E8E3D81C4D4301F2C805@opus.cs.cornell.edu>

Dear all:

As we move towards a final release of OAI-PMH version 2, we have made a
couple of small changes to the protocol specification posted at
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm.  A new
version dated 2002-05-22T16:00:00Z - cjl includes the following:

1. New text at the end of paragraph 1 in section 2.7.1 clarifying error
handling for incorrect from and until arguments for selective harvesting
by datestamp.
2. Elimination of the badGranularity error code. This error code was a
legacy of different granularity specifications in earlier alphas.  The
functionality of the badGranularity error code is now handled by the
badArgument error code.

We will continue to inform you of hopefully small changes up until the
final release.
