Subject: [OAI-general] Survey about version identification in open access
	repositories
Message-ID: <56F3B4769EBB084BA235A54049EB2190B840E3@EXCHF3.lse.ac.uk>

Dear Colleagues 

Do you wish to influence the development of version identification in
university-managed open access collections in order to help build trust
in the versions of university research content being deposited and made
openly accessible?

The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) [1] has funded the
VERSIONS Project [2] to investigate current attitudes and practice
relating to version identification in digital repositories and open
access research paper collections. 

We invite you to participate in our user requirements study via one or
both of our online questionnaires.

1. For experts and stakeholders (library and repository communities, OAI
community, university management, publishers, and other interested
parties): 
'Identifying versions of academic papers in institutional repositories' 
www.survey.lse.ac.uk/versionssurveyexperts 


2. For academic and research staff and research students: 'Versions of
academic papers online - the experience of authors and readers' 
www.survey.lse.ac.uk/versionssurveyresearchers 

If you are also able to assist us by bringing these surveys to the
attention of relevant colleagues in your institution who will not
receive this message, we would be very grateful.

The VERSIONS Project is led by the Library of the London School of
Economics and Political Science [3], with the Nereus Consortium [4] of
European research libraries in economics as associate partners.

If you have any queries about the work of the VERSIONS Project or the
survey, please reply to me directly at the address below.

Thank you for your interest.

Yours sincerely


Frances Shipsey

Dear all,

few weeks ago, the digitAlexandria project (www.digitalexandria.com),
 from the Italian National Research Council, has released
the pre-beta version of Archivemaker, a new software
for building OAI-PMH-compliant institutional archives.
The main characteristcs of the software are:

- Few minutes are enough to install and build the archive
- An average pc user can easely do all the work
- Direct and easy groupware management
- Powerful management of the internal and external visibility
     of each document
- Automatic creation of a web page showing the archive.
     A provisional page is here (remember that is not an official
     page, but a test page):

  http://bdaweb.bo.cnr.it:8000/servlet_query-browse_gtype-0_gid-83_opengid-79_style-bda

If you want to try the software, you can get it here,
along with a Beginner's Guide:

http://bdaweb.bo.cnr.it:8000/download_am.php

You can sign in with the following UN and PW:

UN		PW
guest2e	Guest2e
guest3d	Guest3d
(capital letters count)

Try the first; if it's busy, try the
second. If they are both busy, ask another UN and PW
by replying this email.

We will be grateful to all those who will report us bugs,
advices and suggestions at tech@bdaweb.net.

Max
