I guess I'm saying that resumptionTokens don't necessarily guarantee you'll
get &quot;all the new stuff&quot;, but could if appropriately implemented. The
stateless alternative, though, seems to assume an idealistically static
repository. If records are deleted from the repository, a stateless
harvesting solution doesn't seem to allow for the possibility of getting all
the new stuff. 

Imagine a resultset with 1 million records served in 1000 record chunks.
During the course of the harvest 10 records get deleted from the repository.
Since the stateless solution relies on the position of a cursor, the
client's view of the cursor may be as many as 10 records beyond the server's
view and thus records will be missed. Using resumptionTokens, however, I can
maintain a consistent cursor between client and server.

Also, I'd like to use OAI for internal operations within our organization.
Under those circumstances, I can make assumptions about the OAI
server/harvester such as records will never vanish and instead will be
flagged as deleted. With millions records in our repository, I'd like to
avoid a complete reharvest wherever possible. I don't believe reharvests can
be avoided using stateless harvesting the way they can with stateful
harvesting.
