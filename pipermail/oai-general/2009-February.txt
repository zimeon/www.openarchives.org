We are pleased to announce that the registration for the CERN Workshop 
on Innovations in Scholarly Communication (OAI6), which will be held at 
the University of Geneva on 17th-19th June 2009, is open now.

Registration form, program, accommodation, travel information and other 
details can be found on our web site : 
http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=48321

Excerpt from the first announcement :
"The workshop will follow the successful format of previous workshops 
mixing practical tutorials, presentations from cutting-edge projects and 
research, discussion groups, posters, and an intense social programme to 
maximize interaction and communication. It will be possible to register 
for a part or all of the programme.

The workshop is aimed at those involved in the development of openaccess 
(OA) repositories and who can influence the direction of developments 
either within their institution, their country or at an international 
level - that includes technical developers of OA bibliographic databases 
and connected services, research information policy developers at 
university or library level, funding bodies concerned with access to the 
results of their research, OA publishers,and influential researchers 
keen to lead OA developments in their own field."

We look forward to welcoming you to Geneva next June.
