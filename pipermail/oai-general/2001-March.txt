     Internet Tools for Scholarly Publishing and Peer Review

     Dr Simon Buckingham Shum and Dr Stuart Watt

     The Challenge: Designing and evaluating next generation scholarly peer
     review tools in the age of internet publishing

     The successful candidate for this PhD will join an innovative project
     investigating new forms of scientific/scholarly publishing and peer
     review for the internet.

     Technologies for scholarly interpretational spaces

     A key problem we are working on in KMi is how to extend the Net beyond
     being a vast document library by adding interpretational spaces -
     technology mediated forums for interpreting, making sense, critiquing,
     debating, making new connectionsä Meaning arises from perspectives,
     which make new connections. How can technologies like open hypertext,
     annotation, discussion/argumentation systems, ontologies, text
     analysis and visualizations of documents and associated concepts help
     the interpretation of resources in the library.

     In sum, without interpretation, there is no meaning or significance,
     and we are left drowning in the information flood. We want to provide
     computational support for interpretation. KMi is interested in
     implementing interpretational spaces for researchers to analyse
     documents.

     Background to KMi systems

     JIME: E-journal peer review. The Journal of Interactive Media in
     Education (JIME) is a peer reviewed, electronic journal (ejournal),
     published since 1996, to promote interdisciplinary dialogue through
     the use of a Web-based peer review process. JIME articles are
     published in a purpose-designed Web document-discussion user
     interface, which tightly links the article to an area for review
     comments and discussion. Reviewers can post comments under threads
     based on the journal's review criteria (e.g. Originality of Ideas), or
     they can make section-specific comments. The review process is
     designed to enable authors, reviewers and the wider community engage
     in constructive discussion as opposed to the conventional anonymous
     'issuing of a verdict'. Authors have the right of reply, and reviewers
     (non-anonymous) are accountable for what they say. This intellectual
     history is preserved with the final publication in the form of an
     edited version with the most significant comments and replies, which
     remains an open forum for authors (e.g. to post updates) and readers
     to comment. <http://www-jime.open.ac.uk>

     D3E web document discussion infrastructure. There are hundreds of
     links in a given article, which are generated by a Web publishing
     toolkit called D3E (Digital Document Discourse Environment). D3E has
     found many applications beyond JIME, is under development on an open
     source basis, and is in use by a variety of groups.
     <http://d3e.open.ac.uk>

     Open Archives Eprint Servers. A promising platform for delivering
     these services to the widest possible community is the Open Archives
     Initiative (OAI), specifically, their Eprint server software. The Open
     Archives Initiative <http://www.openarchives.org> has developed a
     protocol to enable researchers to search for scholarly documents over
     multiple ePrint servers. The Eprints server 'shell' that enables a
     knowledge community to self-archive their documents is now freely
     available <http://www.eprints.org>. The basis for providing
     third-party services on top of the eprint server data is outlined in
     the report of the first prototype implementation
 
<http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february00/vandesompel-ups/02vandesompel-ups.html>

     PhD focus

     The goal of the PhD will be to survey the range of proposed models for
     scholarly publishing and peer review on the internet, and in the light
     of this analysis, to implement and evaluate an environment that could
     support research comunities. OAI and D3E are prime candidates, given
     KMi's experience with them, but the strategy taken will clearly have
     to take into account the rapid technical developments that
     characterise internet and knowledge-based publishing.

     Applicants should be able to demonstrate that they can work with
     relevant web server technologies and standards. OAI servers ar
     implemented in Perl and MySQL on Linux/Unix servers. The D3E toolkit
     generates files for D3E-Phorum a customization of the PHP-based Phorum
     system.

     However, the ideal candidate will also have experience, or a strong
     interest, in the social dimensions that ultimately will make or break
     tools to support publishing and discourse in scholarly research.

     Relevant publications:

     Applicants will be expected to have formed ideas based on examining
     JIME and associated papers <http://www-jime.open.ac.uk/about.html#reading>,
     and OAI and Eprint documents.

     Supervision:

     This studentship will be jointly supervised by Dr Simon Buckingham
     Shum and Dr Stuart Watt. Dr Buckingham Shum has expertise in fields of
     HCI, design rationale, graphical argumentation and electronic
     journals. Dr Watt has expertise in software agents for online communities,
     knowledge modelling and management, and the teaching of cognitive 
modelling.
     We encourage informal enquiries from prospective students who want to
     discuss ideas.

     Modelling and Visualizing Research Literatures over the Internet

     Dr Simon Buckingham Shum and Dr John Domingue

     The Challenge: Providing researchers with next generation tools for
     tracking and analysing research concepts

     The successful candidate for this PhD will join a dynamic team working
     on the Scholarly Ontologies digital library project
     [http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/scholonto].

     There are several
     possible kinds of research that could be conducted, depending on your
     background and interests. Suitable backgrounds would include Hypertext
     (semantic systems; open hypermedia), HCI (information visualization;
     usability studies), CSCW (collaborative construction of shared
     information spaces; classification theory/boundary objects), AI
     (ontologies; knowledge modelling), Digital Libraries (document
     semantics; DL user interfaces; RDF/metadata) and Computer Science
     (information extraction; Java/web user interfaces; web databases).

     Some example PhDs might focus on:

        * Understanding how researchers conceptualise their fields, and
          research literatures
        * Designing and evaluating visualizations and other advanced
          services
        * Implementing information extraction technologies to identify
          scholarly claims in documents, in order to seed a knowledge base

     Relevant publications:

     Applicants will be expected to have formed ideas based on papers on
     the Scholarly Ontologies Project website

     Supervision:

     The above 2 projects will be jointly supervised by Dr Simon Buckingham
     Shum and Dr John Domingue. Dr Buckingham Shum has expertise in fields of
     human-computer interaction, design rationale, graphical argumentation
     and electronic journals. Dr Domingue has expertise in human-computer
     interaction, information visualization, and knowledge engineering,
     specifically collaborative, web-based ontology construction.

important is rebutting the Science Editors' Rebuttal to Roberts et al.

               THE SELF-ARCHIVING ALTERNATIVE

                   Stevan Harnad


Roberts et al., in "Building A "GenBank" of the Published Literature"
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/291/5512/2318a> argue
compellingly for the following three pleas to publishers and authors:

It is imperative to free the refereed literature online. To achieve this
goal, the following should be done:

    (1) Established journal publishers should give away their
    journal contents online for free.

    (2) Authors should submit preferentially to journals that give
    their contents away online for free.

    (3) In place of established journals that do not give away their
    contents online for free, new journals (e.g., BioMed Central
    <http://www.biomedcentral.com>) should be established that do.

The goal of freeing the refereed literature online is completely valid,
optimal for science and scholarship, attainable, inevitable, and indeed
already overdue. But these proposed means alas do not look like the
fastest or surest way of attaining that goal, particularly as there is a
tested and proven alternative means that will attain the very same goal
without asking journals to do anything, and without asking authors to
give up anything:

    (i) There is no reason journals should pre-emptively agree to give
    away their own contents online at this time. If researchers wait
    until many or most journals find a reason for doing so, it will be a
    very, very long wait.

    (ii) Asking authors to choose which journal to submit their
    research to on the basis of whether or not the journal agrees to give
    away its contents online for free rather than on the basis authors
    currently use -- journal quality, reputation, impact factor -- is
    again an unreasonable thing to ask, and will result in a long, long
    wait. More important, it is an unnecessary thing to ask, as there
    is already a means for authors to achieve precisely the same goal
    immediately without having to give up anything at all: by
    self-archiving their refereed articles themselves, in
    interoperable, University Eprint Archives
    <http://www.eprints.org>. 

    (iii) Creating new journals, without track-records, to draw away
    submissions from the noncompliant established journals, is another
    long uphill path, and again it is not at all clear why authors
    should prefer to take that path, renouncing their preferred
    established journals, when they can have their cake and eat it too
    (through self-archiving).

The details of the self-archiving alternative (including questions of
copyright and embargo) are fully described in "For Whom the Gate
Tolls? How and Why to Free the Refereed Research Literature Online
Through Author/Institution Self-Archiving, Now."

It is entirely unclear to me why Greg always prefers a speculative,
anecdotal conclusion to an empirical one.

For his conclusion can hardly be based on "experience" (except possibly
subjective experience). The fact is that mathematicians have not been
faced with the former choice, as some biomedical scientists have. There
have been no boycotts or petitions in mathematics. And as far as I
know, except if a new give-away online journal has happened to find an
open niche, none have drawn away the authorship of established
journals. The only thing that has happened in mathematics is exactly
the opposite, namely, the latter: The mathematicians, after a later
start than the physicists, have started to self-archive their papers
(in Greg's arXiv).

Yet another instance of the principle: Look at what Simon does, not what
Simon says...

No contest on that one. Every researcher should take it seriously. But
far more important than the journal undermining ITS impact factor by
restricting access, it is undermining the AUTHOR's impact factor. 

http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/science.htm

Solution: Have your cake and eat it too. Stick with your preferred
journal and its impact factor (such as it is), and maximize the impact
of your paper by self-archiving it online in an OAI-compliant Eprint
Archive -- which is EXACTLY what mathematicians in general, and the
contributors to Greg's Archive in particular have done!

I remind the reader that Greg and I are on the same team insofar as
freeing the research literature online is concerned. Where we differ is
that Greg -- for reasons unfathomable to me, since OAI-compliance makes them
interoperable and equivalent -- does not like distributed
institutional archives, and prefers centralized arXiv-archiving
<http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/>. 

Greg asked me in this Forum whether I don't in fact feel the same way,
out of fealty to "my" own centralized archive, CogPrints
<http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk>, and was surprised to hear that I
couldn't care less! I just want the refereed literature freed online,
whether centrally or institutionally (especially now that they are
equivalent). And since, despite its head start, central archiving is
only growing linearly, and still limited to a few disciplines, it needs
all the help it can get; I hope that distributed institution-based
archiving will provide just the boost the self-archiving initiative needs to
reach critical mass fast.

Our other point of disagreement, aired repeatedly in the Forum, is on
peer review. In another Simon-says/Simon-does dissociation, Greg says
that mathematicians don't want or need peer review; all they need is
(centralized!) self-archiving and post-hoc open commentary. The peer
review is just to please the tenure committees. But alas, this
empirical hypothesis has no objective evidence in its support (just
some subjective testimony from Simon), because what Simon DOES in this
new self-archiving era is EXACTLY the same as what he did before: He
continues to submit all his work to his preferred refereed journals.
The only thing that is new is that IN ADDITION, he self-archives it
(thereby freeing it).

In other words, our disagreement has no substance. Pay attention to what
Simon does, not what he says. What he does is to self-archive (not to
switch journals). The hope is that Simon will soon be not just a
physicist or a mathematician, but representative of all the
disciplines.

What does not yet have enough widespread "credibility" is
self-archiving itself (which Simon is already doing, centrally, in 35%
of physics and 20% of mathematics). The hope is that the new option of
institution-based self-archiving will augment and distribute the
"credibility" of self-archiving, both in the disciplines that have
already had the sense to begin self-archiving, and those that have not.

Institution-based, OAI-compliant self-archiving is new. The OAI 1.0
release of the eprints.org archive-creating software only took place on
January 23, to coincide with the release of OAI 1.0. There are well
over 100 sites who are trying out the software, and UC is not one, but
three of them. I don't know about Davis in particular; perhaps someone
from UC-Davis can reply. But I do know that it's being tested by UC at
the level of the California Digital Library 
<http://www.escholarship.cdlib.org/eprints.html> because it was mandated
(by the Regents?) that UC must have Online Archives for its researchers
to self-archive in by 2001.

<http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/resolution.htm#7.2.>

I am not in a position to reply about your problems with your Computing
Center. I expect that as distributed institutional self-archiving picks
up, it will get better resourced.

Thanks for not criticizing their use of the software...

Stay tuned.

Subject: [OAI-general] California Digital Library ePrint Repositories
Message-ID: <4.2.0.58.20010327161256.00af3670@popserv.ucop.edu>

I would like to offer listserv readers a clarification with regard to the 
Kuperburg-Harnad exchange - quoted below - which refers to the eprint 
archives sponsored by the University of California-based California Digital 
Library.

The California Digital Library hosts the "eScholarship" program to support 
scholar-led experiments and innovation in scholarly communication. (Readers 
are encouraged to browse escholarship.cdlib.org for more information.) 
Included in that support are eprint repositiories made available to 
specific scholarly communities who would like to use them as a primary 
means to disseminate scholarship or as an arena in which to experiment with 
other innovations such as peer-reviewed journals as "overlays" to the 
contents of a repository.

Important characteristics of our efforts, some of which were misrepresented 
in the Kuperburg-Harnad exchange below, include:
* CDL's eprint repositories are discipline-based, not institutional. To 
date participating disciplinary communities include Dermatology, 
International and Area Studies, and Tobacco Control Research. Readers will 
not be surprised to learn that these communities include leading UC faculty 
members who were responsible for bringing to our attention a community's 
readiness to experiment.
* There is no administrative or Regent-level "mandate" that the University 
of California have archives or that its researchers use them. There is UC 
Presidential support for the eScholarship program and strong desire for UC 
to contribute to innovation in scholarly communication. The design of the 
eScholarship program has so far focused on researchers' affinities and 
affiliations with disciplinary communities rather than on institutional 
affiliation. We continue to have  discussions with a number of scholarly 
societies about possible collaboration in the development of eprint 
repositories.
* Our repositories are quite young, having opened in January 2001, and are 
still in a phase of community testing and feature development.
* Community use of our repositories is scholar-led, usually through an 
editorial or advisory board of participating scholars, including many with 
no UC affiliation. Policy setting, including whether use is focused on 
self-archiving or with community-based filtering, or a combination, is up 
to the community.
* We are quite pleased to have the eprints software from eprints.org 
available to underlie the initial versions of eScholarship repositories. We 
expect to work with Stevan's group on the further development of the 
software but also leave open the possibility that a different 
infrastructure may be needed to meet community needs.
* We are also enthusiastic about the potential for the Open Archives 
Initiative  and its metadata harvesting protocol to allow interoperabiltiy 
across our own and other eprint repositories. Note also that we believe OAI 
is likely to facilitate interoperation or federation of other scholarly 
materials and are contributing to discussions in the OAI community on this 
very topic.
