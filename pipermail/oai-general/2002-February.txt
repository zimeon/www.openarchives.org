Subject: [OAI-general] Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting Version 2 news
Message-ID: <706871B20764CD449DB0E8E3D81C4D4301F2C762@opus.cs.cornell.edu>

Dear OAI community: 

In mid-2001 the Open Archives Initiative Technical Committee (OAI-TC) was
formed to develop and write version 2 of the Open Archives Protocol for
Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).  In this email, we would like to inform you about:

* The context of this technical work;
* The process for undertaking the work;
* The schedule for the release of v.2.0 of the OAI-PMH;
* Anticipated changes in v.2.0 of the OAI-PMH.

Carl Lagoze and Herbert Van de Sompel

=> The context of this technical work was:

1. The original release of the OAI-PMH, version 1.x, was intended to
initiate a year long period of experimentation with the protocol.  The goal
was to make this experimental version as stable as possible to encourage
usage and testing. (In fact, only one change from version 1.0 to 1.1 was made
during the year in response to a W3C change in the XML schema
specification).

2. The OAI-TC work should avoid if possible the addition of significant
functionality to the protocol. Instead, the scope of work should be to
resolve problems that arose over the past year in reaction to experience in
the user community.

3. While it was not deemed necessary that version 2.0 be backward compatible
with version 1.x, the upgrade path when version 2 is release should be
reasonably straightforward.

4. The result of the work, version 2, should be a stable, "standard"
release.  It remains undecided as to whether a formal standardization
process will be undertaken with the version 2 protocol.


 => The process for undertaking this work has been: 

1. Formation of the OAI-TC representing technical expertise from a
cross-section of the OAI community.  Conduct of this work within a closed
technical committee follows the same procedure which was successfully used
for the development of OAI-PMH v. 1.x.  Members of OAI-TC are listed at
http://www.openarchives.org/organization/tech.comm.html.

2. Joint identification of issues 

3. Development of issue white papers 

4. Vetting of white papers to determine those that were in scope of OAI-TC
work 

5. Development of issue resolution 

6. On-line and phone meetings to reach final issue resolution 

7. Reporting and validation of the results of the work of OAI-TC to the OAI Steering Committee.
Members of OAI-SC are listed at
http://www.openarchives.org/news/oaiscpress000825.html

8. Protocol revision and writing 
      

=> The schedule for the release of v 2.0 of the protocol is as follows: 

1. March 1: release of the protocol to a limited group of alpha testers 

2. April 1: beta public release 

3. May 1: final public release 


=> The following is a summary of the changes that are anticipated for
version 2 of OAI-PMH: 

1. Dates and times - Standardize on UTC for all dates and times in protocol
requests ("from" and "until" arguments) and responses.
        
 2. Harvesting Granularity- Allow all ISO8601 time granularities in dates
and times in the "from" and "until" arguments of protocol requests.  Allow a
data provider to expose its support date/time granularity in the response to
an Identity request.  Default granularity is YYY-MM-DD.

3. Flow control - Improve flow control by allowing the following optional
attributes when a resumptionToken is returned:    
* retryAfter - a suggested wait time until the request should be resubmitted

* expirationDate - the projected expiration of the resumptionToken  
* completeListSize - total number of items across entire result set 
* cursor - index of first item in this batch within entire result set 

4. set functionality - It will be possible to specify an identifier as
argument to the ListSets verb, permitting a harvester to inquire to which
sets an item belongs.  Responses to ListRecords and GetRecord will return
the sets to which each item belongs. Support of sets remains optional.

5. base-URL - Insulate harvesters from proxy servers by mandating that the
visible identity of the "handling server" in responses be that of a
persistent "master", that may opaquely reflect requests to slaves. 

6. xml schema for mandatory Dublin Core - Coordinate with the DCMI so that
the schema used by the OAI is based on one managed by DCMI.  Must allow
inclusion of the xml lang attribute (specifying the language of the metadata
value). 
        
7. Dedupping - Define an optional "provenance" XML container that can be
attached to metadata records that a data provider aggregates from other
sources.  This will help harvesters in detecting duplicates harvested from
multiple data providers. 

8. Error handling - Report OAI errors in OAI responses in a manner
independent of HTTP status codes. 

9. Set description - Define an optional XML container with which communities
can describe individual sets. 

10. Multiple metadata formats - Modify ListIdentifiers to permit a metadata
format as argument, filtering the return to include only record identifiers
that support the specified format.

I strongly feel that sets should be made optional (maybe flagging this in
the Identify response) to reduce the implementation load on small archives.

Sets do not appear to be widely used by harvesters (shout if this is wrong)
and increase implementation complexity by about 25%. The "which sets is this
in" query makes this even more fiddley.

It's easy for harvestors not to support sets, but if it's meaningless which
it seems to be for some (many?) archives then forcing them to do extra work
reduces the number who will uptake.

also:

This is also more complexity, why is it needed?

Tim Brody raised a point in a different thread that hasn't been addressed
yet:

	I would be interested to know how resumptionTokens can be avoided,
	as RT is both flow-control (which can be replaced by start-maxrows
	requests), but also state information (i.e. which records are to be 
	returned). If different sections of the same query are requested, 
	without state being maintained, surely there is a risk that some 
	records may be missed in the overlap? (or are you presuming that all

	records are added, and returned, sequentially?)

Of course, resumptionTokens don't guarantee that an arbitrary data provider
will return a complete set of results. They merely provide a mechanism to
make it possible. Without such a guarantee, harvesters are obliged to
periodically reharvest the entire repository if they want to pick up those
missed items.

I guess I'm saying that resumptionTokens don't necessarily guarantee you'll
get "all the new stuff", but could if appropriately implemented. The
stateless alternative, though, seems to assume an idealistically static
repository. If records are deleted from the repository, a stateless
harvesting solution doesn't seem to allow for the possibility of getting all
the new stuff. 

Imagine a resultset with 1 million records served in 1000 record chunks.
During the course of the harvest 10 records get deleted from the repository.
Since the stateless solution relies on the position of a cursor, the
client's view of the cursor may be as many as 10 records beyond the server's
view and thus records will be missed. Using resumptionTokens, however, I can
maintain a consistent cursor between client and server.

Also, I'd like to use OAI for internal operations within our organization.
Under those circumstances, I can make assumptions about the OAI
server/harvester such as records will never vanish and instead will be
flagged as deleted. With millions records in our repository, I'd like to
avoid a complete reharvest wherever possible. I don't believe reharvests can
be avoided using stateless harvesting the way they can with stateful
harvesting.

Description:

Digital libraries (DLs) are increasingly common on the Web,
providing ordered, vetted digital collections to targeted user groups.
To date, much of DL research has focused on the acquisition and
representation of digital objects, optimizing and personalizing user
services, and interoperability efforts.  Few DLs employ mirrors, much less
some of the more sophisticated, non-client-server architectures found
in WWW deployment, e.g. peer-to-peer systems and distributed storage
architectures.  Although these new architectures have been succesfully
applied to a large number of Internet services, they have had little
impact on DL research.  Are they technically suitable for DL use, or do
social and economic issues prevent their adoption?

This workshop will explore these issues as well as highlight some of the
more novel DL architectures.  A range of theoretical, technical,
and speculative papers are sought to discuss and propose alternate DL
architectures and approaches.  Papers are requested in the following
and related topics:

        - Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems
        - Adaptive digital libraries
        - Wireless access to digital libraries
        - Grid computing
        - Distributed searching
        - Metadata harvesting
        - Distributed storage systems
        - Serverless storage and information retrieval
        - DL requirements vs. ordinary web requirements
        - Provenance, trust, integrity and archival issues
          in distributed digital libraries

Scirus includes arXiv.org e-prints

Scirus.com, the web search engine for scientific information launched by
Elsevier Science last April, has now made 180.000 e-prints from arXiv.org
(formerly xxx.lanl.gov) available to its users. The e-prints of arXiv.org
were harvested using the Protocol for Metadata Harvesting of the Open
Archive Initiative. Scirus has just been voted Best Specialty Search Engine
in the prestigious Search Engine Awards 2001, and is planning to add
additional OAI sources to its index in the near future to broaden its
coverage further.

Subject: [OAI-general] Open Digital Libraries (ODL)
Message-ID: <3C71DF8F.1000001@vt.edu>

Announcement: Open Digital Libraries Project

The creation of Open Digital Libraries (ODLs) is the aim of a research 
project at Virginia Tech, investigating the building of digital 
libraries as networks of independent components, with inter-component 
communication based on the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting and 
extensions thereof.

More documentation, online demonstrations and prototype components can 
be found on the project website at:
    http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/odl/

The current suite of tools available for experimentation include:
  - Harvest, a Perl-based OAI/ODL harvester module
  - DBUnion, to perform aggregation of OAI/ODL archives
  - IRDB, search engine over an arbitrary OAI/ODL archive
  - sample user interface to the IRDB search engine
(Additional components are under development to provide other typical DL 
services such as submission and browsing.)

Common features of the current component suite includes:
  - simplicity: minimal number of external dependencies and no makefiles
  - object-oriented Perl to support extensibility
  - XML Schema for all configuration information
  - single installation, multiple instance model
  - configure.pl to create instances and set/edit parameters
