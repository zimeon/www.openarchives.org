Subject: [OAI-general] Changes in OAI-PMH support in DSpace at MIT
Message-ID: <40700B4C02ABD5119F000090278766440C655340@hplex1.hpl.hp.com>

All,

As mentioned in previous mails, there are a couple of changes to the OAI-PMH data provision service of DSpace at MIT:

- We've changed the identifiers used to conform to the OAI identifier spec

- A couple of changes 'touch' every item in the system.  For example, internally in DSpace authors are stored as qualified DC 'contributor.author'.  When exporting via OAI-PMH, these authors are mapped to the unqualified 'creator' element to fit community practices and expectations.

- Set structure changed to expose collection structure (and not communities, which are like to change over time)

- The old base URL slightly confused people, and also made it difficult to deploy stylesheets and so forth in the OAI-PMH webapp, allowing browser-based 'harvesting'.

So, the base URL of the OAI-PMH data provision service at DSpace at MIT has changed to:

http://dspace.mit.edu/oai/request

Please update your records accordingly.

This is essentially a 'new' repository.  If you've previously been harvesting DSpace, and wish to link records previously harvested to those in the new system, the identifier mapping is pretty simple.  The previous identifier was simply the item's Handle, e.g:

hdl:1721.1/123456

The new identifier contains an OAI identifier prefix, with the same suffix:

oai:dspace.mit.edu:1721.1/123456

Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause, however this seemed the best route forward given the various issues involved.

Subject: Re: Central versus institutional self-archiving

In a study in the UK which we have just completed for the Joint Information
Systems Committee, JISC (a brief account of which will, referees permitting,
be published in a forthcoming special issue of Serials Review), after quite
exhaustive review of all aspects of e-prints archiving, we recommended a
"harvesting model", in which full texts (and other digital objects) remain
at distributed institutional (and other) archives, but metadata is harvested
and processed centrally.  This model seemed to overcome most of the
drawbacks of a distributed model mentioned by Richard Durbin.

The NIH is a very large, important organisation, but it is not "the biological
community"! It is only a part of the biological community.

One must also keep in mind, for example, the large French national
biological institutes such as the Life Science portions of CNRS, INSERM,
INRA, and Institut Pasteur, which collectively constitute about 10,000
biomedical researchers in France alone. (Germany has similar demography,
with its network of Max-Planck Institutes. Other countries too.)

    "In response to the Berlin Declaration, the European Commission has
    begun a study of... access to published papers... Because 41% of
    scientific papers originate in Europe (compared with 31% in America),
    the results of this study could have a big effect..."

    The Economist, Monday August 9th 2004

Its seems logical that each institute should choose to have its own
institutional archives, although PubMed Central could certainly serve as
an important mirror site for French (and other national) research output.

If centralism were really necessary, that would be only if there
were substantive technical reasons for it. In France, we have excellent
technical support from CCSD http://ccsd.cnrs.fr/ which is ready to help in
the OA self-archiving of all of France's scientific output. Moreover, the
OAI metadata harvesting protocol makes all the distributed institutional
archives worldwide interoperable with one another.
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html

So it is not at all clear that Richard Durbin's suggestion that the
biomedical sciences are on their way toward central self-archiving
is accurate: There is more likely to be a mix of institutional and
central self-archiving, as there is in other disciplines. Fortunately,
the OAI protocol will integrate all these distributed archives and make
them all interoperable, so users worldwide need not worry about where the
full-texts are actually located.
