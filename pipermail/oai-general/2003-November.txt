Subject: [OAI-general] RSS Feed Form the UIUC OAI Registry
Message-ID: <3FA92273.9060001@uiuc.edu>

Hi all,

I've just added an RDF Site Summary (RSS) feed to the OAI registry at UIUC. 
  The URL for the RSS feed is http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/rss.asp 
This may be useful for people who are trying to keep track of the latest and 
greatest OAI providers.  The RSS feed will list the 10 most recently added 
or modified repositories.  This is something I just threw together without 
knowing too much about RSS, so if anyone discovers any problems please let 
me know.

Last night I also ran my gOAIglePop script.  This script programatically 
does some Google searches, looking for OAI repositories.  If it finds a URL 
which appears to be an OAI repository it issues an Identify request.  If it 
gets a valid response, its found a repository.  The results of the script 
run can be found at http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/gOAIgle.xml The 
latest run found three previously unknown repositories (at least to the 
registry).  If anyone is interested, the best Google query I've found for 
finding OAI repositories is 'allinurl:verb=Identify'.  Type this into the 
Google query textbox and press Search.

Comments are welcome and enjoy...

Subject: [OAI-general] OAI Harvester Plug-In for DSpace
Message-ID: <OF4CDB45CC.B1BAE5E3-ON85256DE0.00728267@cs.odu.edu>


The Digital Library Research Group at Old Dominion University in
collaboration with the Research Library of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory is pleased to announce an alpha version of the OAI harvester
plug-in, which can ingest metadata, as well as full text, from  OAI-PMH 2.0
compliant data providers to DSpace* with some pre-specified mapping. Once
harvested, the records can be retrieved using Dspace standard search
interface. The mapping of OAI_DC metadata to Dspace can be specified using
a XML template. The plug-in is available at
http://kepler.cs.odu.edu:8080/kepler/dspace/index.html
