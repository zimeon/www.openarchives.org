<PRE>Hi Steve

I think we are in agreement here.

Perhaps one of the issues is that the open archives concept also exposes all of
these millions of refereed articles to the public at large. Academics might find
that the &quot;Sokal Affair&quot; was benign compared to a potential fire storm in a time
of shrinking public support for post secondary education.

What indeed would happen if the weight of decisions on promotion/tenure and pay
were shifted towards teaching and measures of student satisfaction rather than
peer review?  Or articles that did not meet standards in one or more
publications appear vetted by another source- what then?

In essence, while OAI opens research for sharing, its potential to cause
restructuring within The Academy is more than idle speculation or an
intellectual exercise

thoughts?
