Hi

I am putting together a search engine for a selected number of OAI metadata
databases. Below is the news item I posted to the OAI web site:

my.OAI is a full-featured search engine to a selected list of metadata
databases from the Open Archives Initiative project. my.OAI can be
tailored by the user to suit individual interests and provides the
following features: Forms based query formulation; Automatic display of
summaries when viewing search results; Automatic display of similar
document when viewing a document; Automatic mark-up of retrieved
document with search links; Search history; Saving searches for later
re-use (with an SDI option); Saving document in folders. The user
interfaces is not yet complete, user account creation still needs to be
added in, but we are making it available now so that we can get feedback
on the functionality from users.

The URL to the search engine is:

    http://www.myoai.com/

I am releasing this before I have fully finished the functionality to get
feedback/comments/suggestions from people. Hopefully I will have the account
creation done in a couple of week's time.

Cheers

Francois

Subject: [OAI-general] Update on Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting version 2.0
Message-ID: <706871B20764CD449DB0E8E3D81C4D4302A204F3@opus.cs.cornell.edu>

Dear all:

We'd like to bring you up-to-date on progress towards release of version
2.0 of the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
(OAI-PMH).  This is a follow-on to a previous message, archived at +AFs-1+AF0-,
summarizing changes in the protocol.

As scheduled we completed the first alpha of the protocol document on
March 1.  This document was released to a group of alpha testers and the
OAI technical committee.  The last few weeks have been busy with
discussions among this group with the goal of fine tuning the revised
protocol.

The nature of the discussions in the alpha and technical groups and our
commitment to make version 2.0 a stable protocol version have led us to
a decision to push our protocol release date to June 3, 2002.  You may
recall from the earlier email +AFs-1+AF0- our decisions that:

1. Version 2.0 of the protocol will not be backwards compatible with
1.1.  Since the release of version 1.0, we have characterized the 1.x
releases as 'experimental'.  Results from the considerable amount of
experimentation over the past year mandate a number of changes that make
backward compatibility impractical.
2. Version 2.0 of the protocol is NOT experimental and is meant to be a
STABLE base of implementation.  

We feel that ensuring the credibility of these commitments is of primary
importance leading to the conclusion that extending the alpha test
period for version 2.0 is the proper decision.  An added benefit of
extending the alpha testing period is that there will be sufficient time
for important tools such as the Repository Explorer to be version 2.0
compatible by the time of the production release.

To summarize the release and migration schedule:

+AD4APgA+AD4-June 1, 2002

Production release of the following:

1. OAI-PMH version 2.0
2. Annotated OAI-PMH version 2.0 detailing changes from version 1.1
3. OAI-PMH version 2.0 Usage Guidelines document.
4. OAI-PMH version 2.0 Registration and conformance testing software

+AD4APgA+AD4-September 1, 2002

Registered sites that have not upgraded will be sent a reminder that
they must upgrade.  As of this date, attempts to register at the OAI
registration site +AFs-2+AF0- MUST conform to OAI-PMH version 2.0

+AD4APgA+AD4-December 1, 2002

Sites that have not upgraded will be removed from the OAI registration
site.

As always thanks for your participation and support of the OAI
community.
