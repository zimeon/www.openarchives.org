<PRE>Dear All,

In the Rome meeting, we have discussed and decided the following (in terms of the planned
chapters of the white paper):

  2. Goals of this workshop/whitepaper
	a. Propose a method for conceptual model comparison and sharing
	b. Identify the set of common notions and the differences between the two models 
	c. Identify the problem issues which arise when trying to compare/converge  two models, the 	              inadequacies of the method

  3.  Description of CIDOC/CRM - identify functional purpose, scope, nature of contents, examples
  4.	Description of ABC - identify functional purpose, scope, nature of contents, examples
  5.	Proposal of a formal analytical deterministic method(s) to compare/converge ontologies. 

Consequently, the Darmstadt meeting will address:

  6.	Application of the proposed method(s) to ABC and CIDOC/CRM to compare the two models and identify 	        commonalities and differences:
	-	Ontologically
	-	Representationally
		*	Compare modelling constructs
		*	Compare metalevel constructs (patterns)
	-	Identify achievable sharing
  7.	Evaluation of the method used for ontology comparison 
	-	Does it scale?
	-	Is it persistent?
	-	What are its inadequacies?

If  time allows:
  8.	Representation alternatives for the merged ontology - form, expressive power, encoding 
	-	compare expressiveness of different representation mechanisms
	-	transform common/merged ontology into a useful representation
  1.a  Definition of Terms/Glossary somewhere near the front e.g., what we mean by &quot;model&quot;, &quot;schema&quot;, 	       &quot;ontology&quot;, &quot;refinement&quot;,
&quot;interoperability&quot;

In the third (final) meeting, we shall address:
  9.	Management and administration - how to manage the merged ontology, how to manage future 		         incorporation of other ontologies
  10.	Research issues, future work.

--------------------------------------------------------------

In this light, Carl and me propose the following GENERAL AGENDA:
======================================================

1. Presentations of intermediate developments:
	a. Short presentation of related ontologies/projects (Dan Brickley)
	b. Presentation of the latest version of ABC Harmony (Carl/Jane)
	c. Presentation of the new scope definition of the CRM and
   	   amendments to version 3.1 (the class &quot;Existence&quot;). (Martin)
2. Merging CRM and ABC Harmony:
	* guided discussion following the proposed methodology, eventually using
           CIMI examples.
	* creation of a draft mapping/merge
	* identification of conceptual differences and their sources,
		open philosophical issues, need for further elaboration.
3. Presentation of Nikolay's progress in formal merging - discussion.
4. Evaluation of the comparison method

5. Home work distribution:
    Chapters 1.-7., 
    Proposal for Chapt. 8, representation alternatives, with clarifying discussion.

During point 2., discussion of some terminology  issues may be necessary, I would
however propose to focus the whole meeting to come up with a good draft mapping
and identification of conceptual differences. This will give substance to all the rest. 

I propose meeting times of 9:00 - 18:00 on both days.

-----------------------------

We (Carl, Jane, me, and whoever likes) shall elaborate details of the agenda Wednesday before
the meeting during ECDL.

-----------------------------

For your better preparation, please read carefully the exchange of comments over the e-mail list,
the latest ABC definition (<A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/lagoze/papers/DC2001.pdf">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/lagoze/papers/DC2001.pdf</A>), 
 the CRM version 3.2 (<A HREF="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/docs/cidoc_crm_version_3.2.rtf">http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/docs/cidoc_crm_version_3.2.rtf</A>), class &quot;Existence&quot;,
and the CRM Scope (<A HREF="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/crm_scope_definition.html">http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/crm_scope_definition.html</A>).

The discussion will use CIMI examples, ABC form: <A HREF="http://www.metadata.net/harmony/ABCV2.htm,">http://www.metadata.net/harmony/ABCV2.htm,</A>
CRM form : <A HREF="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/data_transformations.html">http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/data_transformations.html</A>

I STRONGLY recommend reading of FRBR (<A HREF="http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr.htm">http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr.htm</A>), not
only because of the subject, but also because of the quality of definition.

All comments much appreciated, any input before and during the discussion on known modelling
alternatives of events and other related concepts welcome.

Best wishes,

Martin
