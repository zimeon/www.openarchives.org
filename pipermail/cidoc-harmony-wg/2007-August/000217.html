<PRE>
Hello this is Christine Vanhouser with P.P. Bancard Services and I wanted to speak with you this week. 

We are helping businesses save money on their V/MC Processing and also their ATM Processing with our Programs.

For V/MC Processing no matter if you are Retail or Internet our rates don't change and don't include any Monthly Statement Fees, Monthly Minimum Fees, or Contracts:
 
1.69% for all Visa and MasterCard Swiped
2.15% for all Visa and MasterCard if you Key Enter 
10 cents For All Transactions   
2.75% for all Rewards and Corporate Cards
$13 Chargeback Fee (Only if you get a Chargeback)
5 cents AVS
4 cents Batch
$1.00 Voice Authorization (Only if you use it)
No Monthly Statement Fees
No Monthly Minimum Fees

If you are Retail we will provide you with a Free New Hypercom T7P Plus Terminal to own and keep if you do over $50,000 a year and if you do under that amount we will give you the New Hypercom for only $100. If you are Internet you will receive our Virtual Terminal program with no Setup Fees. Again there's no Monthly Statement Fees.

For ATM Processing, we have 3 Unique Programs Depending On Your Needs:

1.) Free ATM Program- We'll give you a Free Triton 9100 and load the machine on-going for you at no cost. The surcharge will be $2.25 and you'll receive 50 cents on each amount, but you must receive over 300 customers a day to qualify.

2.) ATM Reprogram- We'll Reprogram your existing ATM and you'll receive 100% of the surcharge amount.

3.) ATM Purchase- We'll provide you with an ATM with a great flat price or low monthly price and you'll receive 100% of the surcharge amount. 

Send me an email with a great telephone number to reach you this week and discuss this further. Also tell me which program were you most interested in. I look forward to speaking with you.
