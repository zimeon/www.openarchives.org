Hello, this is Christine Vanhouser with PP Bankcard Payments and I wanted to give you a call this week to discuss a situation.

We are finding that many Retail and Internet Businesses are on a high rate structure called, &quot;Enhanced Billback,&quot; and this is where you end 

up paying 4-5% a Transaction every time you receive a Rewards, Corporate, or International Credit Card. 

Because about 50% of your transactions are Rewards Cards, this causes businesses to overpay by 10-15% a year in Processing costs.

Our program comes with the Industry's Lowest Rates and there's No Monthly Fees, No Monthly Minimum Fees, No Annual Fees, and No Setup Fees. You will only pay Processing costs when you actually receive a credit card sale. 

Plus...you will receive a New Hypercom T7P Plus Terminal to own and you keep the Terminal even if you stop processing with our company. Every 3 years we'll upgrade your Terminal to the latest version at no cost. 

** Very Important, you must currently do over $15,000 a month or over $180,000 a year in V/MC sales to qualify for our program. 

Send me an email with a great telephone number to reach you this week and discuss this further. I look forward to speaking with you.

In Regards,
Christine Vanhouser
Office Manager and Assistant
PP Bancard Services and Systems
