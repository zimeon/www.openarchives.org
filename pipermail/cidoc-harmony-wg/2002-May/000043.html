      a) agreement on the functionality of the merged ontoloy
      b) Dedicated discussion of the interpretation of FRBR
           &quot;Manifestation&quot; and &quot;Expression&quot;. Both teams should argree on the same
           interpretation of FRBR entities, as it is a conceptualiation
           of a third-party.
      c) agreement on the differences, overlaps and subsumption
          relationships between ABC and CRM classes and properties.
          This implies improvement of scope notes/ verbal definitions of
          ABC and CRM entities.
      d) agreement of the future of the merged ontology,
          status and maintenance

            - topics to be covered,
            - important references,
            - authors
      c) Description of CRM/ABC:

            - key references or appendices,
            - authors
      d) The Merging:
            - topics to be covered,
            - structure of subsections
            - agreement on what are the key lessons learned
            - agreement on conclusions about the applied method
                     may be automatic versus intellectual merging?

            -authors
     g) Bibliography
            - how to gather input from all partners, in which form
                     (e.g. commented wrt sections/phrases in the Report,
