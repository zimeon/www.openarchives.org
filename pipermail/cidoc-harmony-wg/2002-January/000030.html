<PRE>Dear Jane,

&gt;<i>From my side, I would like very much to hold the 3rd workshop 
</I>of the DELOS-Hamony Working Group on Ontology Harmonization in Crete from 
May 22-24. I shall definitely work on the White Paper and report 
in March and April. I shall make an elaborate proposal for merging the
two ontologies. It would be good, to have the different bids from the partners
we have so far decided on until March, so I can take them into account.

I see a key role in comparing our concepts by Nicola's metaproperties,
e.g. the CRM concept of Actor differs from the ABC concept Agent in
rigidity. 

The second key aspect for me is to make very clear the different views
and intentions behind these models, which have lead to the modelling
choices. I think the discussion has made very clear, that the essential
differences come from different views and not from equally valid encoding
alternatives.

Therefore I propose an approach, which sets these views and intentions into
relation on the background of the common world we describe, and connect the
models on this base. I shall formulate out this idea at least one month before
the meeting.

So, for me the goal of the 3rd meeting is to produce and decide on a merged 
model, to define its scope of validity, to agree on a common description 
of the foundations and methodological aspects that enabled the comparison
and merging, and make a proposal for maintenance and evolution of the
merged model in a diverse community.

The goal is to finish the common report / white paper until August 2002.

Please all partners to comment.

Best wishes,

Martin
