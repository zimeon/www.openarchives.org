<PRE>Dear All,

We fix the 3rd Meeting of the DELOS-Hamony Working Group on Ontology Harmonization
to take place June 3-5, in Crete, and ask for the formal agreement by the DELOS 
Project.

Participation confirmed until now:

Carl Lagoze
Jane Hunter
Martin Doerr

Interest in participation so far declared by:
Nick Crofts
Nicola Guarino
Stephan Koernig

So far no member of the Group has given a negative answer on his/her participation.

I propose to invite:
Tony Gill
Mark Bide
John Mylopoulos

Context of the Meeting:

I shall work on the White Paper and report in March and April. 
I shall make an elaborate proposal for merging the two ontologies. 
It would be good, to have the different bids from the partners
that have declared their interest in producing parts of the
White Paper/ Final Report until March, so I can take them into account.

I see a key role in comparing our concepts by Nicola's metaproperties,
e.g. the CRM concept of Actor differs from the ABC concept Agent in
rigidity. 

The second key aspect for me is to make very clear the different views
and intentions behind these models, which have lead to the modelling
choices. I think the discussion in Darmstadt has made very clear, that the essential
differences come from different views and not from equally valid encoding
alternatives.

Therefore I propose an approach, which sets these views and intentions into
relation on the background of the common world we describe, and connect the
models on this base. I shall formulate out this idea at least one month before
the meeting.

Agenda:

The objectives of the 3rd meeting are to produce and decide on a merged 
model, to define its scope of validity, to agree on a common description 
of the foundations and methodological aspects that enabled the comparison
and merging, and make a proposal for maintenance and evolution of the
merged model in a diverse community.

I propose to devote 2 days of the meeting to elaborate and find agreement
on the above, and to devote the 3rd day to summarize and make decisions on
our common positions for all relevant parts of the final report. The latter
implies the formulation of critical phrases. 

The goal is to finish the common report / white paper until August 2002.

I kindly ask all partners, if they wish to present relevant related work
they have done within this Group or in other contexts.

Venue:

We can either meet at our facilities a bit outside of Heraklion, or we can rent
a meeting space in a Hotel at the coast. The latter will have some associated
costs, I guess about 1200 Euros. Can DELOS cover that? The advantage will be, 
that we can stay together in the evening and probably will have a more relaxed 
atmosphere. We may also get a reduced accomodation price.

Please comment.

Best wishes,

Martin
