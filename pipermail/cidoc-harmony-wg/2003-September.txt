Dear Sir/Madam,
Due to reasons i would explain in greater details later,i am in search of a
sincere partner to assist me in securing and investing the sum of
USD25,000.000 (twenty five million  dollars)inherited from my father's
foreign deposit.
I am one of the surviving child of late Mr Micheal Wamalwa ,the former Kenya
vice president who died in a London hospital august this year . Before his
death, my father who foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and property
based on his position and the insecurity of the region, decided to deposit
the above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money
was deposited with my name as the beneficiary . My father as a wealthy
African is a polygamist with so many wives and children.I am the only child
from my mother to my father and my mother is very sick with severe stroke
now.
To summarise this  story, my mother and I have decided to offer 20% of the
above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds or 25% share of a
possible joint venture business.
if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed
information. if you do not accept my offer,in good fate treat with utmost
confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers for
more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
DANIEL WAMALWA.
