<h2><a name="abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The ResourceSync <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a> introduces a pull-based 
synchronization framework for the web that consists of various capabilities that a Source can implement to allow 
Destinations to remain synchronized with its evolving resources.
This ResourceSync notification specification describes two additional, push-based, capabilities that a Source can support. Both 
are aimed at reducing synchronization latency and entail a Source sending notifications to subscribing Destinations. 
</p>
<p>
This specification is one of several documents comprising the <a href="/rs/">ResourceSync Framework Specifications</a>.

<h2>1. <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
This specification describes notification capabilities defined for the 
<a href="/rs/">ResourceSync framework</a>.
The push-based notification capabilities are aimed at decreasing the synchronization latency between a Source and a Destination that is inherent in 
the pull-based capabilities defined in the ResourceSync <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a>.
Two notification capabilities are specified and both entail a Source sending notifications to subscribing Destinations. 
The <a href="#ChangeNoti">Change Notification</a> capability consists of a Source sending notifications 
about changes to its resources. The <a href="#FrameworkNoti">Framework Notification</a> capability consists of a Source sending out notifications 
about changes to its implementation of the ResourceSync framework, for example the publication of a new Resource List 
or the updating of a Change List.
</p>

<h3>1.1. <a name="MotivExamples"></a>Motivating Examples</h3>

<p>
Applications based on Linked Data integrate resources from various datasets, with resources likely changing at a different pace. 
The BBC Linked Data applications that integrate data from, among others, Last.FM, DBpedia, MusicBrainz, and GeoNames serve as examples. 
The accuracy of services based on such an integrated resource collection depends on the contributing resources being up-to-date.
The update frequency of LiveDBPedia resources, for example, has been observed to average around two changes per second.
This provides a significant synchronization challenge that the <a href="#ChangeNoti">Change Notification</a> capability 
aims to address. 
</p>

<p>While the pull-based capabilities specified in the ResourceSync <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a> 
allow Destinations to remain informed about the evolving state of a Source's resources, they do leave the question open as to when 
a Destination should check whether, for example, a Source has published a new Resource List or has updated a Change List. 
A pragmatic solution is for Destinations to recurrently poll a Source at a frequency that is based on experience with the pace of prior 
updates. The <a href="#FrameworkNoti">Framework Notification</a> capability is about informing Destinations about changes to a 
Source's ResourceSync environment, thereby providing an explicit trigger to poll a Source, and in doing so  
removing uncertainty and optimizing the synchronization process. The efficiency gain of this approach is particularly 
significant in the case of a Source with infrequent changes where Destinations nonetheless require low latency updates.</p>

<h3>1.2. <a name="NotConv">Definitions and Namespace Prefix Bindings</a></h3>

<p>This specification uses the terms "resource", "representation", "request",
"response", "content negotiation", "client", and "server" as
described in [<a href="#ref-webarch">Architecture of the World Wide Web</a>].</p>

<p>Throughout this document, the following namespace prefix bindings
are used:</p>

<h2>2. <a name="NotificationChannels"></a>Notification Types and Channels</h2>
<p>
Notifications are applied at two distinct levels in the ResourceSync framework:
<ol>
 <li><b>Change Notifications</b> are sent to inform Destinations about resource change events, for example, when a Source's resource that is subject to synchronization was created, 
updated, or deleted. Details are provided in <a href="#ChangeNoti">Section 3</a>.
 </li>
 <li><b>Framework Notifications</b> are sent to inform Destinations about changes to capabilities of the ResourceSync framework, for example, if a Source's Change List or Capability List 
was created, updated, or deleted. Details are provided in <a href="#FrameworkNoti">Section 4</a>.
 </li>
</ol>
As is the case with all capabilities in the ResourceSync framework, the Change Notification and Framework Notification capabilities 
are independent and can be implemented in a modular manner.
</p>
<p>
Notifications are sent from Source to Destination using a push technology. Change 
Notifications and Framework Notifications are sent on different notification channels. 
The payload for these notifications are described in <a href="#ChangeNoti">Section 3</a> and 
<a href="#FrameworkNoti">Section 4</a>, respectively. The transport protocol used to send notifications is 
discussed in <a href="#Transport">Section 5</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="#fig_notification-single">Figure 1</a> displays the <a href="/rs/resourcesync#Structure">structure of the ResourceSync framework</a> 
for a Source that has a single <a href="/rs/resourcesync#Terminology">set of resources</a>, showing  
the 
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#SourceDesc">Source Description</a> and 
the <a href="/rs/resourcesync#CapabilityList">Capability List</a> at the top. 
The Capability List advertises four distinct capabilities: a 
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DescResources">Resource List</a>, a 
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DesChanges">Change List</a>, a 
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#PackResources">Resource Dump</a>, and a 
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#PackChanges">Change Dump</a>.
The figure also shows a Framework Notification channel (red hexagon) and a Change Notification channel (yellow hexagon) and indicates the 
levels of the framework they apply to:
<ul>
<li>The Change Notification channel (yellow hexagon) is used to send information about resource changes for a specific set of resources.
Changes to these resources are communicated as change notifications via the 
Change Notification channel.</li>
<li>The Framework Notification channel (red hexagon)  is used to send information about changes in the various capability documents 
(e.g. Resource List, Change List, etc.), as well as in the Capability List and the Source Description.
Changes to all these documents are communicated as framework notifications via the 
Framework Notification channel.</li>
<li><a href="#fig_notification-single">Figure 1</a> also shows that framework notifications are not sent for 
changes at the level of an index document. For example, if new Resource Lists are created that reside under a Resource List Index 
then the framework notification is only sent about the creation of one of the Resource Lists and not about the creation of the 
encompassing Resource List Index. It is the Source's responsibility to ensure that the Resource List Index points to all new component
Resource Lists at the time of the notification.
Also, a framework notification sent about a change to a document that resides under an index must contain a link with the relation type 
<code>index</code> pointing at that index. This allows Destinations to navigate towards the index and detect further changes there. 
For example, the framework notification about the creation of a new Resource List must contain an <code>index</code> link pointing at the
Resource List Index.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 1: A Framework- and a Change Notification channel in the ResourceSync framework structure</p>
</div>

<p>
The ResourceSync framework allows a Source to offer multiple <a href="/rs/resourcesync#Terminology">sets of resources</a> 
in which case the Source Description points to
multiple Capability Lists, one for each set of resources. 
This scenario has the following implications for the notification capabilities: 
<ul>
 <li>
A dedicated Change Notification channel must be provided for each distinct set of resources for which Change Notification is supported.
A notification about a change to a resource is sent via the Change Notification channel that is associated with the set of resources under which the resource resides. 
If a resource resides under multiple sets of resources, a notification is sent on each of the Change Notification channels associated with those sets of resources.
</li>
 <li>
A dedicated Framework Notification channel must be provided for each distinct set of resources for which Framework Notification is supported. 
This means that each set of resources has 
its own Framework Notification channel through which notifications about changes to capability documents 
and the Capability List associated with the set of resources are sent. 
However, notifications about changes to the Source Description (e.g., if a new Capability List was created) are sent via all Framework Notification 
channels. This way a Source can make sure that Destinations remain informed about changes to the overall organization of the Source's ResourceSync implementation 
regardless of the Framework Notification channel they subscribe to. 
</li>
</ul>

<a href="#fig_notification-multi">Figure 2</a> depicts a scenario where a Source offers multiple sets of resources and its Source 
Description therefore points to multiple Capability Lists, one for each set of resources, in this case <code>Capability List 1</code>
and <code>Capability List 2</code>.
<a href="#fig_notification-multi">Figure 2</a> shows that each set of resources has a designated Change Notification and 
Framework Notification channel.
<code>Change Notification channel 1</code>, for example, is used to send change notifications about changes to resources that are part 
of the set of resources covered by <code>Capability List 1</code>.
In contrast, <code>Framework Notification channel 2</code> is used to send notifications about changes to the capability documents advertised by
<code>Capability List 2</code> and about changes to <code>Capability List 2</code> itself. 
Notifications about changes to the Source Description are sent via <code>Framework Notification channel 1</code> and 
<code>Framework Notification channel 2</code>.

<p>
Note that the creation and deletion of Change Notification channels and Framework Notification 
channels is reflected in updated Capability Lists (see <a href="#AdvNotChan">Section 6</a>). 
This specification does not define a separate notification about notification channels.
</p>

<h2>3. <a name="ChangeNoti">Change Notification</a></h2>
<p>
A change notification is sent on the appropriate Change Notification channel, as described in <a href="#NotificationChannels">Section 2</a>, 
if a Source wishes to notify a Destination that one or more of its resources subject to
synchronization have changed. By subscribing to a Change Notification channel, a Destination can reduce synchronization latency and avoid 
periodically polling the Source's Change Lists to determine whether resource changes have occurred.
</p>

<p>
The format of a change notification is very similar to the Change List format introduced in 
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DesChanges">Section 10 of the core specification</a>
except that it contains entries only for those changes that have occurred since the previous change notification 
was sent on the channel.
It is based on the <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> document format introduced by the Sitemap protocol.
It has the <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> root element and the following structure:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The optional <code>&lt;rs:md&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code>, that, if included, must have a 
<code>capability</code> attribute that has a value of <code>changelist-notification</code>. It also has the optional 
<code>from</code> and the optional <code>until</code> attributes that, if used, must both be provided. 
The <code>from</code> attribute indicates that the change notification includes all changes that occurred to the set of resources at the Source 
since the datetime expressed as the value of the attribute. The  <code>until</code> attribute indicates that the change notification 
includes all changes that occurred to the set of resources at the Source up until the datetime expressed as the value of the attribute.
</li>
 <li>The optional <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> points to the Capability List with the relation type
<code>up</code>.</li>
 <li>One <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> for each resource change. This element does not have attributes, but uses
child elements to convey information about the changed resource. The <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element has the following child elements:
 <ul>
  <li>A mandatory <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code> child element provides the URI of the changed resource.</li>
  <li>A mandatory <code>&lt;lastmod&gt;</code> child element with semantics as described in 
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DocumentFormats">Section 5 of the core specification</a>.
All entries in a change notification must be provided in forward chronological order: the least recently changed 
resource must be listed at the beginning of the change notification payload, while the most recently changed resource must be 
listed at the end.</li>
  <li>A mandatory <code>&lt;rs:md&gt;</code> child element must have the attribute <code>change</code> to convey the nature of the change.
Its value can be <code>created</code>, <code>updated</code>, or <code>deleted</code>.
It can further have attributes <code>hash</code>, <code>length</code>, and <code>type</code>, as described in <a href="/rs/resourcesync#DocumentFormats">Section 5 of the core specification</a>.</li>
  <li>Optional <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child elements link to related resources as described in 
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DocumentFormats">Section 5</a> and 
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#LinkRelRes">Section 12 of the core specification</a>.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
Change notifications do not use the <code>&lt;sitemapindex&gt;</code> document format 
introduced by the Sitemap protocol. In the event that there are a very large number 
of simultaneous changes at a Source, the notifications must be split into a sequence
of change notifications using <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> documents.
</p>

<h2>4. <a name="FrameworkNoti">Framework Notification</a></h2>
<p>
A framework notification is sent on the appropriate Framework Notification channel, as described in <a href="#NotificationChannels">Section 2</a>, 
if a Source wishes to notify a Destination about changes to Resource Lists, Change Lists, Resource Dumps, Change Dumps, Capability Lists, and Source Descriptions.
By subscribing to a Framework Notification channel, Destinations can refrain from periodically pulling these documents to determine whether they changed.
</p>
<p>
The format of a framework notification is very similar to the Change List format introduced in 
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DesChanges">Section 10 of the core specification</a>.
It is based on the <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> document format introduced by the Sitemap protocol.
It has the <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> root element and the following structure:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An optional <code>&lt;rs:md&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code>, that, if included, must have a 
<code>capability</code> attribute that has a value of <code>framework-notification</code>. 
</li>
 <li>An optional <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> with the relation type
<code>up</code>.</li>
<ul>
<li>If the change notification pertains to a capability document such as a Resource List, the target of the link is the Capability List.</li> 
<li>If the change notification pertains to a Capability List, the target of the link is the Source Description.</li>
</ul>
 <li>One <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> per framework notification. 
This element does not have attributes, but uses child elements to convey information about the change to the framework. 
The <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element has the following child elements:
 <ul>
  <li>A mandatory <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code> child element provides the URI of the changed capability document, Capability List or Source Description.</li>
  <li>A mandatory <code>&lt;rs:md&gt;</code> child element that must have two attributes. The first is the <code>change</code> attribute, used  
to convey the nature of the change. Possible values are <code>created</code>, <code>updated</code>, or <code>deleted</code> and their use is as shown in 
<a href="#tab_2_1">Table 2.1</a>.
The second attribute is <code>capability</code>, used to indicate the component of the framework that has undergone the change.
Possible values are <code>changelist</code>, <code>resourcelist</code>, <code>changedump</code>, <code>resourcedump</code>, 
<code>capabilitylist</code>, and <code>description</code>. For notifications about changes to archival capabilities, 
the values for the <code>capability</code> attribute defined in the <a href="/rs/archives">Archive specification</a> are used.
Additional values may be defined in other specifications for additional capabilities.</li>
 <li>A mandatory <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element with the relation type <code>index</code> that points to an index document in case the document
that has undergone a change resides under one.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
Framework notifications do not use the <code>&lt;sitemapindex&gt;</code> document format 
introduced by the Sitemap protocol.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#ex_4_1">Example 4.1</a> shows the payload of a framework notification informing the Destination about the
availability of a new Resource List.

   &lt;/url&gt;
&lt;/urlset&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="caption">Example 4.1: The payload of a framework notification that informs about the availability of a new Resource List</p>

<p>
As shown in <a href="#fig_notification-single">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#fig_notification-multi">Figure 2</a>, 
framework notifications are never sent at the index level. 
If the Source sends a framework notification about the change to a document (e.g., a Resource List) 
that resides under an index, it must provide a <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element to the 
<code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element in which that change is communicated. The relation type of that link must be 
<code>index</code>, and the target of the link must be the index (e.g., the Resource 
List Index) that the changed document resides under.
</p>
<p>
It is likely that framework notifications only contain information about a single change to the framework.
However, multiple such changes can be aggregated into a single framework notification. 
<a href="#ex_4_2">Example 4.2</a> shows the payload of a framework notification informing the Destination about 
a new Resource List, a new Resource Dump, and about an updated Change List. The Resource List 
resides under an index and hence the corresponding <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element has a <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child 
element with the relation type <code>index</code>. Note that the framework notification only contains one entry for
one new Resource List that resides under an index even though the index likely points to other new Resource Lists.

<h2>5. <a name="Transport">Transport Protocol: PubSubHubbub</a></h2>

<p>In order to bootstrap the notification capabilities of the ResourceSync framework, a single 
transport protocol is chosen: PubSubHubbub [<a href="#ref-pubsubhubbub">PubSubHubbub</a>]. PubSubHubbub is a simple, 
HTTP-based publish/subscribe protocol that is expected to perform well for framework notifications and for use cases 
that do not require change notifications to be sent at a very high frequency. Another transport protocol, WebSockets 
<a href="#ref-rfc6455">RFC 6455</a> will be explored and may be added in the future.</p>

<p><a href="#tab_5_1">Table 5.1</a> maps terminology used in ResourceSync and PubSubHubbub. In order to implement 
the publish/subscribe paradigm, PubSubHubbub introduces a <code>hub</code> that acts as a conduit between Source and Destination. 
A hub can be operated by the Source itself or by a third party. It is uniquely identified by the <code>hub URI</code>.
PubSubHubbub's <code>topic</code> corresponds with the notion of channel used in this specification. 
A topic is uniquely identified by its <code>topic URI</code>. Hence, 
per set of resources, the Source has a dedicated topic (and hence topic URI) 
for its change notifications and framework notifications, respectively.</p>

<p>The remainder of this section describes the use of PubSubHubbub in ResourceSync. It only provides 
the information about the PubSubHubbub protocol that is essential to gain an adequate understanding of the 
overall mechanism. Details about the PubSubHubbub protocol are available in the specification [<a href="#ref-pubsubhubbub">PubSubHubbub</a>].
<a href="#fig_pubsubhubbub">Figure 3</a> shows an overview of HTTP interactions between Source, Hub, and Destination. They will be detailed

<h3>5.1. <a name="Source2Hub">Source Submits Notifications to Hub</a></h3>

<p>The PubSubHubbub protocol provides no specific guidelines regarding the way in which a Source should communicate 
notifications to a hub. The mechanism for ResourceSync notifications is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each set of resources, the Source has a dedicated topic URI
for its change notifications and framework notifications, respectively. 
The response to an HTTP HEAD/GET request issued against a topic URI 
must have an HTTP "204 no content" response code and an HTTP Link header with the following links:
 <ul>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>self</code> relation type 
 that provides the topic URI for the submitted notification 
 as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>hub</code> relation type 
 that provides the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>resourcesync</code> relation type 
 that provides the URI of the Capability List for the set of resources covered by the topic URI (channel)
 as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 </ul>
This is shown as "Hub verifies topic URI" in <a href="#fig_pubsubhubbub">Figure 3</a>.
</li>
<li>A Source submits the payload for a change notification or framework notification to a hub. 
The notification payload is provided as the body of an HTTP POST issued against the hub URI. 
This HTTP POST must have an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header with a value of <code>application/xml</code> and 
an HTTP Link header with the following links:
 <ul>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>self</code> relation type 
 that provides the topic URI for the submitted notification 
 as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>hub</code> relation type 
 that provides the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>resourcesync</code> relation type 
 that provides the URI of the Capability List for the set of resources covered by the topic URI (channel)
 as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 </ul>
This is shown as the right pointing arrow of "Source notifies Hub" in <a href="#fig_pubsubhubbub">Figure 3</a>.
</li>
<li>The hub, if operated by a third party, may want to verify whether the HTTP POST was submitted by a legitimate 
ResourceSync Source. This is the case if all the following hold:
 <ul>
 <li>The payload of the HTTP POST is a valid <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> document.</li>
 <li>The HTTP POST contains an HTTP Link header with the aformentioned links.</li>
 <li>The response to an HTTP HEAD/GET issued against the topic URI contains an HTTP Link header with the aformentioned links.</li>
 <li>The response to an HTTP GET issued against the URI of the link with the <code>resourcesync</code> relation type 
 has a HTTP 2XX status code and the response body is a Capability List, i.e. a valid 
 <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;sitemapindex&gt;</code> document.</li>
 </ul>
<li>The hub responds to the submission of the payload for a change notification or framework notification as follows:</li>
 <ul>
 <li>The response must have HTTP "200 OK" status code if the submission was successful.</li>
 <li>The response must have a HTTP 3XX, 4XX or 5XX status code if the submission was not successful.</li>
 </ul>
This is shown as the left pointing arrow of "Source notifies Hub" in <a href="#fig_pubsubhubbub">Figure 3</a>.
</li>
</ul>

change notification payload of <a href="#ex_3_1">Example 3.1</a>. For brevity, the payload is not shown

<h3>5.2. <a name="Destination2Hub">Destination Subscribes to Hub to Receive Notifications</a></h3>

<p>A Destination subscribes to a Source's topic using the process described in the section 
"Subscribing and Unsubscribing" of <a href="#ref-pubsubhubbub">PubSubHubbub</a>. 
The process consists of mandatory subscription request and subscription verification phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the subscription request phase, shown as "subscription" in <a href="#fig_pubsubhubbub">Figure 3</a>, 
the Destination indicates it wants to subscribe to notifications 
pertaining to a Source's topic URI (channel). In order to do so, a Destination 
provides a form as the body of an HTTP POST issued against the hub URI.
This HTTP POST must have an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header with a value of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> and 
the form contains the following information:
<ul>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.callback</code> parameter that has as value the Destination's callback URI, that is 
the URI to which the hub should submit the notifications pertaining to the Source's topic URI.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.mode</code> parameter that has as value <code>subscribe</code>.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.topic</code> parameter that has as value the Source's topic URI 
that the Destination wants to subscribe to.</li>
<li>The optional <code>hub.lease_seconds</code> parameter that has as value the number of seconds 
that the Destination desires the subscription to remain active. A Destination that provides a value needs to be aware 
that it may or may not be honored by the hub.</li>
</ul>
The hub must respond to a subscription request with an HTTP "202 Accepted" response code 
as an indication that the request was received and will be verified.
</li>
<li>In the subscription verification phase, shown as "verification" in <a href="#fig_pubsubhubbub">Figure 3</a>,
the hub verifies whether the Destination genuinely intended to subscribe, 
and whether the Destination has control over the callback URI it provided.
In order to do so, the hub issues an HTTP GET against the Destination's callback URI with the following 
query string arguments appended to it:
<ul>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.mode</code> parameter that has as value <code>subscribe</code>.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.topic</code> parameter that has as value the topic URI given in the subscription request.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.challenge</code> parameter that has as value a hub-generated random string.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.lease_seconds</code> parameter that has as value the 
number of seconds that the hub will keep the subscription active. This actual 
subscription period may differ arbitrarily from what the Destination requested. 
It is recommended that the duration of a subscription granted should not be 
less than 300 seconds (5 minutes) and should not be more than 2678400 seconds 
(1 month). Although these suggested limits are somewhat arbitrary, the lower limit is 
intended to prevent overload by frequent subscription renewals, whereas the 
upper limit is chosen to ensure that non-cancelled subscriptions expire within a 
foreseeable period. In order to maintain a continuous subscription, a Destination 
must take note of the granted subscription period, and it must issue a new 
subscription request before the indicated period expires if it wants to keep 
receiving notifications.
</li>
</ul>
The subscriber confirms its intention to subscribe by sending a response that has an HTTP 2XX status code 
and that has the value of the <code>hub.challenge</code> as its body. Any other response indicates that 
there was no intent to subscribe. .
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#ex_5_2">Example 5.2</a> shows the HTTP POST issued by a Destination against the hub URI 
<code>http://hub.example.org/pubsubhubbub/</code> requesting a subscription to the Source's

<h3>5.3. <a name="Hub2Destination">Hub Delivers Notifications to Destination</a></h3>

<p>When the hub receives a change notification or framework notification from the Source, 
it passes it on to the subscribing Destination(s). The process, shown as "Hub notifies Destination" in <a href="#fig_pubsubhubbub">Figure 3 </a>, is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The hub provides the notification payload received from the Source as the body of an 
HTTP POST issued against the Destination's callback URI. 
This HTTP POST must have an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header with a value of <code>application/xml</code> and 
an HTTP Link header with the following links:
<ul>
<li>A mandatory link with the <code>self</code> relation type 
that provides the topic URI (channel) for the notification 
as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
<li>A mandatory link with the <code>hub</code> relation type 
that provides the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
<li>A mandatory link with the <code>resourcesync</code> relation type 
that provides the URI of the Capability List for the set of resources covered by the topic URI (channel)
as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The successful response from the subscriber's callback URI must be have an HTTP 2XX code. 
The hub must consider all other subscriber response codes as failures.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#ex_5_5">Example 5.5</a> shows the HTTP POST that the hub issues 
against the Destination's callback URI to relay the

<h3>5.4. <a name="Destination4Hub">Destination Unsubscribes from Hub</a></h3>

<p>The mechanism by which a Destination unsubscribes from a Source's topic URI is as 
described in <a href="#Source2Hub">Section 5.1</a> but uses <code>unsubscribe</code> as the value of 
<code>hub.mode</code> instead of <code>subscribe</code>.</p>

<h2>6. <a name="AdvNotChan">Advertising Notification Channels: PubSubHubbub</a></h2>
<p>
Notification capabilities are advertised via Capability Lists, as is the case with 
the capabilities defined in the <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core ResourceSync specification</a>. 
As both the Change Notification channel and the Framework Notification channel are dedicated to a particular set
of resources, they are advertised in the Capability List that corresponds with the set of resources.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#fig_notification_disco">Figure 3</a> displays a Change Notification channel and a Framework Notification channel advertised 
in a Capability List. 
The figure shows a structure with only one Capability List that advertises its designated notification channels. Other Capability Lists,
each of which pertain to a different set of resources, would advertise their respective notification channels. The displayed Capability 
List could, in addition to the notification channels, advertise other capabilities such as a Resource List or a Change List as introduced 
in the <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a>, 
and also advertise archive capabilities as introduced in the 
<a href="/rs/archives">archiving specification</a>.

<a href="/rs/resourcesync#ex_7_1">Example 7.1 of the core specification</a> with discovery links for a
Change Notification channel and a Framework Notification channel added.
The PubSubHubbub topic URI is provided in the <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code> element, whereas the 
hub URI is provided using a <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code>. 
That <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> must have <code>hub</code> as the value of the <code>rel</code> attribute 
and the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute. 
Note the introduction of 
the <code>change-notification</code> and <code>framework-notification</code> values for the <code>capability</code> attribute to 
indicate the Change Notification and Framework Notification capabilities, respectively.
