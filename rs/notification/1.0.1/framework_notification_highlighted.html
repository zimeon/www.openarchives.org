<h2><a name="abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The ResourceSync <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a> introduces a pull-based
synchronization framework for the web that consists of various capabilities that a Source can implement to allow
Destinations to remain synchronized with its evolving resources.
This ResourceSync Framework Notification specification describes an additional, push-based, capability that a Source can support.
It is aimed at informing Destinations about changes to a Source's ResourceSync implementation; it entails
the Source sending notifications to subscribing Destinations.

<h2>1. <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
This specification describes a <a href="#ChangeNoti">Framework Notification</a> capability defined for the
<a href="/rs/">ResourceSync framework</a>.
The push-based notification capability consists of a Source sending out notifications about changes to its implementation
of the ResourceSync framework, for example the publication of a new Resource List or the updating of a Change List.
Another specification describes a <a href="./notification">Change Notification</a> capability
that consists of a Source sending notifications about changes to its resources in order to decrease
the synchronization latency between a Source and a Destination that is inherent in
the pull-based capabilities defined in the ResourceSync <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a>.
</p>

<h3>1.1. <a name="MotivExamples"></a>Motivating Example</h3>

<p>The pull-based capabilities specified in the ResourceSync <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a>
allow Destinations to remain informed about the evolving state of a Source's resources. However,
they do leave the question open as to when
a Destination should check whether, for example, a Source has published a new Resource List or has updated a Change List.
A pragmatic solution is for Destinations to recurrently poll a Source at a frequency that is based on experience with the pace of prior
updates. The <a href="#FrameworkNoti">Framework Notification</a> capability is about informing Destinations about changes to a
Source's ResourceSync environment, thereby providing an explicit trigger to poll a Source, and in doing so
removing uncertainty and optimizing the synchronization process. The efficiency gain of this approach is particularly
significant in the case of a Source with infrequent changes where Destinations nonetheless require low latency updates.</p>

<h3>1.2. <a name="NotConv">Definitions and Namespace Prefix Bindings</a></h3>

<p>This specification uses the terms "resource", "representation", "request",
"response", "content negotiation", "client", and "server" as
described in <a href="#ref-webarch">Architecture of the World Wide Web</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this document, the following namespace prefix bindings
are used:</p>

<h2>2. <a name="NotificationChannels"></a>Framework Notification Channels</h2>
<p>
Framework Notifications are sent to inform Destinations about changes to capabilities of a Source's
implementation of the ResourceSync framework,
for example, if a Source's Change List or Capability List was created, updated, or deleted.
The payload for these notifications is described in <a href="#FrameworkNoti">Section 3</a>.
Notifications are sent from Source to Destination on one or more channels provided
by a push technology discussed in <a href="#Transport">Section 4</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#fig_notification-single">Figure 1</a> displays the <a href="/rs/resourcesync#Structure">structure of the ResourceSync framework</a>
for a Source that has a single <a href="/rs/resourcesync#Definitions">set of resources</a>, showing
the
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#SourceDesc">Source Description</a> and
the <a href="/rs/resourcesync#CapabilityList">Capability List</a> at the top.
The Capability List advertises four distinct capabilities: a
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DescResources">Resource List</a>, a
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DesChanges">Change List</a>, a
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#PackResources">Resource Dump</a>, and a
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#PackChanges">Change Dump</a>.
The figure also shows a Framework Notification channel (red hexagon) and indicates it is used to
send information about changes in the various capability documents
(e.g. Resource List, Change List, etc.), as well as in the Capability List and the Source Description.
Changes to all these documents are communicated as framework notifications via the
Framework Notification channel.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#fig_notification-single">Figure 1</a> also shows that framework notifications
are not sent for changes at the level of an index document. For example, if new Resource Lists are created that
reside under a <a href="/rs/resourcesync#ResourceListIndex">Resource List Index</a>
then the framework notification is only sent about the creation of one of the Resource Lists and
not about the creation or update of the
encompassing Resource List Index. It is the Source's responsibility to ensure that the Resource List Index points to all new component
Resource Lists at the time of the notification.
Also, a framework notification sent about a change to a document that resides under an index must contain a
link with the relation type
<code>index</code> pointing at that index. This allows Destinations to navigate towards the index and detect further changes there.
For example, the framework notification about the creation of a new Resource List must contain an <code>index</code>
link pointing at the Resource List Index.
</p>

<div class="image">
<a name="fig_notification-single"></a>
<img alt="A Framework Notification channel" src="img/framework_notification_level_single_cap.png"/>
<p class="caption">Figure 1: A Framework Notification channel in the ResourceSync framework structure</p>
</div>

<p>
The ResourceSync framework allows a Source to offer multiple <a href="/rs/resourcesync#Definitions">sets of resources</a>
in which case the Source Description points to
multiple Capability Lists, one for each set of resources.
A dedicated Framework Notification channel must be provided for each distinct set of resources for
which Framework Notification is supported. This means that each set of resources has
its own Framework Notification channel through which notifications about changes to capability documents
and the Capability List associated with the set of resources are sent.
However, notifications about changes to the Source Description (e.g., if a new Capability List was created) are sent via all Framework Notification
channels. This way a Source can make sure that Destinations remain informed about changes to the overall organization of the Source's ResourceSync implementation
regardless of the Framework Notification channel they subscribe to.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#fig_notification-multi">Figure 2</a> depicts a scenario where a Source offers multiple sets of resources and its Source
Description therefore points to multiple Capability Lists, one for each set of resources, in this case <code>Capability List 1</code>
and <code>Capability List 2</code>.
<a href="#fig_notification-multi">Figure 2</a> shows that each set of resources has a designated
Framework Notification channel: <code>Framework Notification Channel 2</code> is used to send notifications
about changes to the capability documents advertised by <code>Capability List 2</code> and about changes to
<code>Capability List 2</code> itself.
Notifications about changes to the Source Description are sent via <code>Framework Notification Channel 1</code> and
<code>Framework Notification Channel 2</code>.

<p class="caption">Table 2: Framework Notification Change Types</p>

<p>
Note that the creation and deletion of Framework Notification
channels is reflected in updated Capability Lists (see <a href="#AdvNotChan">Section 5</a>).
This specification does not define a separate notification about notification channels.
</p>

<h2>3. <a name="FrameworkNoti">Framework Notification</a></h2>
<p>
A framework notification is sent on the appropriate Framework Notification channel, as described in <a href="#NotificationChannels">Section 2</a>,
if a Source wishes to notify a Destination about changes to Resource Lists, Change Lists, Resource Dumps, Change Dumps, Capability Lists, and Source Descriptions.
By subscribing to a Framework Notification channel, Destinations can refrain from periodically pulling these documents to determine whether they changed.
</p>
<p>
The format of a framework notification is very similar to the Change List format introduced in
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DesChanges">Section 12 of the core specification</a>.
It is based on the <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> document format introduced by the Sitemap protocol.
It has the <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> root element and the following structure:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The mandatory <code>&lt;rs:md&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> must have a <code>capability</code> attribute that has a
value of <code>framework-notification</code>. It also has the optional <code>from</code> and <code>until</code> attributes.
The <code>from</code> attribute indicates that the framework notification includes all changes that occurred to the set of resources at the Source
since the datetime expressed as the value of the attribute. The  <code>until</code> attribute indicates that the framework notification
includes all changes that occurred to the set of resources at the Source up until the datetime expressed as the value of the attribute.
</li>
 <li>The optional <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code>
 with the relation type <code>up</code>.</li>
<ul>
<li>If the framework notification pertains to a capability document such as a Resource List,
the target of the link is the Capability List.</li>
<li>If the framework notification pertains to a Capability List, the target of the link is the Source Description.</li>
</ul>
 <li>One <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> per framework notification.
This element does not have attributes, but uses child elements to convey information about the change to the framework.
The <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element has the following child elements:
 <ul>
  <li>A mandatory <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code> child element provides the URI of the changed capability document,
  Capability List or Source Description.</li>
  <li>A mandatory <code>&lt;rs:md&gt;</code> child element that must have two attributes and may have three.
  The mandatory <code>change</code> attribute is used
to convey the nature of the change. Possible values are <code>created</code>, <code>updated</code>, or <code>deleted</code> and their use is as shown in
<a href="#tab_2">Table 2</a>.
The mandatory <code>capability</code> attribute is used to indicate the component of the framework that has undergone the change.
Possible values are <code>changelist</code>, <code>resourcelist</code>, <code>changedump</code>, <code>resourcedump</code>,
<code>capabilitylist</code>, and <code>description</code>. For notifications about changes to archival capabilities,
the values for the <code>capability</code> attribute defined in the <a href="/rs/archives">Archive specification</a> are used.
Additional values may be defined in other specifications for additional capabilities. The third, optional, <code>datetime</code>
attribute conveys the datetime of the change, as described in
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DocumentFormats">Section 7 of the core specification</a>. </li>
 <li>In case the document that has undergone a change resides under and index document,
 a <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element must be provided with the relation type <code>index</code> pointing to
 the index document.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
Framework notifications do not use the <code>&lt;sitemapindex&gt;</code> document format
introduced by the Sitemap protocol.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#ex_1">Example 1</a> shows the payload of a framework notification informing the Destination about the
availability of a new Resource List.

   &lt;/url&gt;
&lt;/urlset&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="caption">Example 1: The payload of a framework notification that informs about the availability of a new Resource List</p>

<p>
As shown in <a href="#fig_notification-single">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#fig_notification-multi">Figure 2</a>,
framework notifications are never sent at the index level.
If the Source sends a framework notification about the change to a document (e.g., a Resource List)
that resides under an index, it must provide a <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element to the
<code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element in which that change is communicated. The relation type of that link must be
<code>index</code>, and the target of the link must be the index (e.g., the Resource
List Index) that the changed document resides under.
</p>
<p>
It is likely that framework notifications only contain information about a single change to the framework.
However, multiple such changes can be aggregated into a single framework notification.
<a href="#ex_2">Example 2</a> shows the payload of a framework notification informing the Destination about
a new Resource List, a new Resource Dump, and about an updated Change List. The Resource List
resides under an index and hence the corresponding <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element has a <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child
element with the relation type <code>index</code>. Note that the framework notification only contains one entry for
one new Resource List that resides under an index even though the index likely points to other new Resource Lists.

<h2 class="diff-chg">4. <a name="Transport">Transport Protocol: WebSub</a></h2>

<p class="diff-chg">In order to bootstrap the notification capabilities of the ResourceSync framework, a single
transport protocol is chosen: <a href="#ref-WebSub">WebSub</a>. WebSub is a simple,
HTTP-based publish/subscribe protocol that is expected to perform well for use cases
that do not require notifications to be sent at a very high frequency.</p>

<p class="diff-add">The below description of the use of WebSub for Framework
Notifications is essentially the same as the description of its use for
<a href="notification">Change Notifications</a>.
However, in the interest of self-containdeness of the respective specifications,
and because Change Notifications and Framework Notifications must be sent on
different channels, the description is repeated in both specifications.</p>

<p class="diff-chg"><a href="#tab_3">Table 3</a> maps terminology used in ResourceSync and WebSub. In order to implement
the publish/subscribe paradigm, WebSub introduces a <code>hub</code> that acts as a conduit between Source and Destination.
A hub can be operated by the Source itself or by a third party. It is uniquely identified by the <code>hub URI</code>.
WebSub's <code>topic</code> corresponds with the notion of channel used in this specification.
A topic is uniquely identified by its <code>topic URI</code>. Hence,
per set of resources, the Source has a dedicated topic (and hence topic URI) for framework notifications.</p>

<h3>4.1. <a name="Source2Hub">Source Submits Notifications to Hub</a></h3>

<p class="diff-chg">The WebSub protocol provides no specific guidelines regarding the way in which a Source should communicate
notifications to a hub. The mechanism for ResourceSync framework notifications is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li class="diff-chg">For each set of resources, the Source has a dedicated topic URI
for its framework notifications. The response to an HTTP HEAD/GET request issued against
a topic URI must have an HTTP "200 OK" response code, an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code>
header with a value of <code>application/xml</code>, and an HTTP Link header with the
following links:
 <ul>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>self</code> relation type
 that provides the topic URI for the submitted notification
 as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>hub</code> relation type
 that provides the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 </ul>
<span class="diff-add">The resource identified by the topic URI must have the same
<code>Content-Type</code> (<code>application/xml</code>) as the payload of the
framework notification. If the intention is to serve content at the topic URI
the payload of the most recent framework notification may be suitable. If no
content is provided at the topic URI the response header <code>Content-Length</code>
with the value <code>0</code> should be returned. This communication is shown
as "Hub verifies topic URI" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>.</span>
</li>
<li>A Source submits the payload for a framework notification to a hub.
The notification payload is provided as the body of an HTTP POST issued against the hub URI.
This HTTP POST must have an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header with a value of <code>application/xml</code> and
an HTTP Link header with the following links:
 <ul>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>self</code> relation type
 that provides the topic URI for the submitted notification
 as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>hub</code> relation type
 that provides the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 </ul>
This is shown as the right pointing arrow of "Source notifies Hub" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>.
</li>
<li class="diff-chg">The hub, if operated by a third party, may want to verify whether the HTTP POST was submitted by a legitimate Source.
The hub can do so by establishing a trust relationship with the Source prior to relaying any of its notifications,
for example, through a one time registration mechanism. Once the Hub is relaying notifications, it can still check
 whether the Source adheres to the WebSub protocol. This is the case if all the following hold:
 <ul>
 <li>The HTTP POST contains an HTTP Link header with the aformentioned links.</li>
 <li>The response to an HTTP HEAD/GET issued against the topic URI contains an HTTP Link header with the aformentioned links.</li>
 </ul>
<li>The hub responds to the submission of the payload for a framework notification as follows:</li>
 <ul>
 <li>The response must have HTTP "200 OK" status code if the submission was successful.</li>
 <li>The response must have a HTTP 3XX, 4XX or 5XX status code if the submission was not successful.</li>
 </ul>
This is shown as the left pointing arrow of "Source notifies Hub" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#ex_3">Example 3</a> shows the HTTP POST issued by the Source against its hub to submit the
framework notification payload of <a href="#ex_1">Example 1</a>. For brevity, the payload is not shown
in its entirety. The third party hub URI is <code class="diff-chg">http://hub.example.org/websub/</code>
and the Source's topic URI (channel) for framework notifications pertaining to dataset1 is
<code>http://example.com/dataset1/framework/</code>.</p>

<h3>4.2. <a name="Destination2Hub">Destination Subscribes to Hub to Receive Notifications</a></h3>

<p class="diff-chg">A Destination subscribes to a Source's topic using the process described in the section
"Subscribing and Unsubscribing" of <a href="#ref-websub">WebSub</a>.
The process consists of mandatory subscription request and subscription verification phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the subscription request phase, shown as "subscription" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>,
the Destination indicates it wants to subscribe to notifications
pertaining to a Source's topic URI (channel). In order to do so, a Destination
provides a form as the body of an HTTP POST issued against the hub URI.
This HTTP POST must have an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header with a value of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> and
the form contains the following information:
<ul>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.callback</code> parameter that has as value the Destination's callback URI, that is
the URI to which the hub should submit the notifications pertaining to the Source's topic URI.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.mode</code> parameter that has as value <code>subscribe</code>.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.topic</code> parameter that has as value the Source's topic URI
that the Destination wants to subscribe to.</li>
<li>The optional <code>hub.lease_seconds</code> parameter that has as value the number of seconds
that the Destination desires the subscription to remain active. A Destination that provides a value needs to be aware
that it may or may not be honored by the hub.</li>
</ul>
The hub must respond to a subscription request with an HTTP "202 Accepted" response code
as an indication that the request was received and will be verified.
</li>
<li>In the subscription verification phase, shown as "verification" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>,
the hub verifies whether the Destination genuinely intended to subscribe,
and whether the Destination has control over the callback URI it provided.
In order to do so, the hub issues an HTTP GET against the Destination's callback URI with the following
query string arguments appended to it:
<ul>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.mode</code> parameter that has as value <code>subscribe</code>.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.topic</code> parameter that has as value the topic URI given in the subscription request.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.challenge</code> parameter that has as value a hub-generated random string.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.lease_seconds</code> parameter that has as value the
number of seconds that the hub will keep the subscription active. This actual
subscription period may differ arbitrarily from what the Destination requested.
It is recommended that the duration of a subscription granted should not be
less than 300 seconds (5 minutes) and should not be more than 2678400 seconds
(1 month). Although these suggested limits are somewhat arbitrary, the lower limit is
intended to prevent overload by frequent subscription renewals, whereas the
upper limit is chosen to ensure that non-cancelled subscriptions expire within a
foreseeable period. In order to maintain a continuous subscription, a Destination
must take note of the granted subscription period, and it must issue a new
subscription request before the indicated period expires if it wants to keep
receiving notifications.
</li>
</ul>
The subscriber confirms its intention to subscribe by sending a response that has an HTTP 2XX status code
and that has the value of the <code>hub.challenge</code> as its body. Any other response indicates that
there was no intent to subscribe. .
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#ex_4">Example 4</a> shows the HTTP POST issued by a Destination against the hub URI
<code class="diff-chg">http://hub.example.org/websub/</code> requesting a subscription to the Source's

<code>http://destination.example.net/callback/</code>.</p>

<h3>4.3. <a name="Hub2Destination">Hub Delivers Notifications to Destination</a></h3>

<p>When the hub receives a framework notification from the Source,
it passes it on to the subscribing Destination(s).
The process, shown as "Hub notifies Destination" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3 </a>, is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The hub provides the notification payload received from the Source as the body of an
HTTP POST issued against the Destination's callback URI.
This HTTP POST must have an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header with a value of <code>application/xml</code> and
an HTTP Link header with the following links:
<ul>
<li>A mandatory link with the <code>self</code> relation type
that provides the topic URI (channel) for the notification
as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
<li>A mandatory link with the <code>hub</code> relation type
that provides the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<li>The successful response from the Destination's callback URI must be have an HTTP 2XX code.
The hub must consider all other subscriber response codes as failures.</li>
<li>The Destination may want to verify the payload received from the Hub, for example, confirming that it is
valid XML, has a <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> root element, etc.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="#ex_7">Example 7</a> shows the HTTP POST that the hub issues
against the Destination's callback URI to relay the
notification it received from the Source in <a href="#ex_3">Example 3</a>.
For brevity, the payload is not shown in its entirety. </p>

<h3>4.4. <a name="Destination4Hub">Destination Unsubscribes from Hub</a></h3>

<p>The mechanism by which a Destination unsubscribes from a Source's topic URI is as
described in <a href="#Source2Hub">Section 4.1</a> but uses <code>unsubscribe</code> as the value of
<code>hub.mode</code> instead of <code>subscribe</code>.</p>


<h2 class="diff-chg">5. <a name="AdvNotChan">Advertising Framework Notification Channels: WebSub</a></h2>
<p>
Framework Notification capabilities are advertised via Capability Lists, as is the case with
the capabilities defined in the <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core ResourceSync specification</a>.
As each set of resources has its dedicated Framework Notification channel, that channel is advertised
in the Capability List that corresponds with the respective set of resources.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#fig_notification_disco">Figure 4</a> displays a Framework Notification channel advertised
in a Capability List. The figure shows a structure with only one Capability List that advertises its
designated
Framework Notification channel. Other Capability Lists,
each of which pertain to a different set of resources, would advertise their respective notification channels.
In addition to Framework Notifications, the Capability
List can advertise other capabilities such as a Resource List and Change List as introduced
in the <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a>,
and archive capabilities as introduced in the
<a href="/rs/archives">archiving specification</a>.

<p class="diff-chg">
<a href="#ex_8">Example 8</a> shows the Capability List from
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#ex_13">Example 13 of the core specification</a> with discovery links for a
Framework Notification channel added.
The WebSub topic URI is provided in the <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code> element, whereas the
hub URI is provided using a <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code>.
That <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> must have <code>hub</code> as the value of the <code>rel</code> attribute
and the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.
Note the introduction of
the <code>framework-notification</code> values for the <code>capability</code> attribute to
indicate the Framework Notification capability.
