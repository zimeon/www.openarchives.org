<h2><a name="abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The ResourceSync <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a> introduces a pull-based
synchronization framework for the web that consists of various capabilities that a Source can implement to allow
Destinations to remain synchronized with its evolving resources.
This ResourceSync Change Notification specification describes an additional, push-based, capability that a Source can support.
It is aimed at reducing synchronization latency and entails a Source sending notifications to subscribing Destinations.

<h2>1. <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
This specification describes a <a href="#ChangeNoti">Change Notification</a> capability defined for the
<a href="/rs/">ResourceSync framework</a>.
The push-based notification capability is aimed at decreasing the synchronization latency between a Source and a Destination that is inherent in
the pull-based capabilities defined in the ResourceSync <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a>.
The <a href="#ChangeNoti">Change Notification</a> capability consists of a Source sending notifications
about changes to its resources, for example the creation or deletion of a resource. Another specification describes a
<a href="framework_notification">Framework Notification</a> capability
that consists of a Source sending out notifications about changes to its implementation of the ResourceSync framework,
for example the publication of a new Resource List
or the updating of a Change List.
</p>

<h3>1.1. <a name="MotivExamples"></a>Motivating Example</h3>

<p>
Applications based on Linked Data integrate resources from various datasets, with resources likely changing at a different pace.
The BBC Linked Data applications that integrate data from, among others, Last.FM, DBpedia, MusicBrainz, and GeoNames serve as examples.
The accuracy of services based on such an integrated resource collection depends on the contributing resources being up-to-date.
The update frequency of LiveDBPedia resources, for example, has been observed to average around two changes per second.
This provides a significant synchronization challenge that the Change Notification capability
aims to address.
</p>

<h3>1.2. <a name="NotConv">Definitions and Namespace Prefix Bindings</a></h3>

<p>This specification uses the terms "resource", "representation", "request",
"response", "content negotiation", "client", and "server" as
described in <a href="#ref-webarch">Architecture of the World Wide Web</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this document, the following namespace prefix bindings
are used:</p>

<h2>2. <a name="NotificationChannels"></a>Change Notification Channels</h2>
<p>
Change Notifications are sent to inform Destinations about resource change events, specifically,
when a Source's resource that is subject to synchronization was created,
updated, or deleted. The payload for these notifications is described in <a href="#ChangeNoti">Section 3</a>.
Notifications are sent from Source to Destination on one or more channels provided
by a push technology discussed in <a href="#Transport">Section 4</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#fig_notification-single">Figure 1</a> displays the <a href="/rs/resourcesync#Structure">structure of the ResourceSync framework</a>
for a Source that has a single <a href="/rs/resourcesync#Definitions">set of resources</a>, showing
the
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#SourceDesc">Source Description</a> and
the <a href="/rs/resourcesync#CapabilityList">Capability List</a> at the top.
The Capability List advertises four distinct capabilities: a
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DescResources">Resource List</a>, a
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DesChanges">Change List</a>, a
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#PackResources">Resource Dump</a>, and a
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#PackChanges">Change Dump</a>.
The figure also shows a Change Notification channel (yellow hexagon) and indicates it
is used to send information about resource changes for a specific set of resources.
Changes to these resources are communicated as change notifications via the
Change Notification channel.
</p>

<div class="image">
<a name="fig_notification-single"></a>
<img alt="A Change Notification channel" src="img/change_notification_level_single_cap.png"/>
<p class="caption">Figure 1: A Change Notification channel in the ResourceSync framework structure</p>
</div>

<p>
The ResourceSync framework allows a Source to offer multiple <a href="/rs/resourcesync#Definitions">sets of resources</a>
in which case the Source Description points to multiple Capability Lists, one for each set of resources. In this case,
a dedicated Change Notification channel must be provided for each distinct set of resources for which Change Notification is supported.
A notification about a change to a resource is sent via the Change Notification channel that is associated with the set of resources
under which the resource resides. If a resource resides under multiple sets of resources,
a notification is sent on each of the Change Notification channels associated with those sets of resources.
Change Notifications must be sent on different channels.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#fig_notification-multi">Figure 2</a> depicts a scenario where a Source offers multiple sets of resources and its Source
Description therefore points to multiple Capability Lists, one for each set of resources, in this case <code>Capability List 1</code>
and <code>Capability List 2</code>. <a href="#fig_notification-multi">Figure 2</a> shows that each set of resources has a designated
Change Notification channel. <code>Change Notification Channel 1</code>, for example, is used to send change notifications about changes
to resources that are part of the set of resources covered by <code>Capability List 1</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the creation and deletion of Change Notification
channels is reflected in updated Capability Lists (see <a href="#AdvNotChan">Section 5</a>).
This specification does not define a separate notification about notification channels.
</p>

<a name="fig_notification-multi"></a>
<img alt="Change Notification channels for multiple Capability Lists" src="img/change_notification_level_multi_cap.png"/>
<p class="caption">Figure 2: Change Notification channels for multiple sets of resources</p>
</div>

<h2>3. <a name="ChangeNoti">Change Notification</a></h2>
<p>
A change notification is sent on the appropriate Change Notification channel, as described in <a href="#NotificationChannels">Section 2</a>,
if a Source wishes to notify a Destination that one or more of its resources subject to
synchronization have changed. By subscribing to a Change Notification channel, a Destination can reduce synchronization latency and avoid
periodically polling the Source's Change Lists - if they exist - to determine whether resource changes have occurred.
</p>

<p>
The format of a change notification is very similar to the Change List format introduced in
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DesChanges">Section 12 of the core specification</a>.
All entries in a change notification must be provided in forward chronological order: the resource with the least recent change datetime
must be listed at the beginning of the change notification payload, while the resource with the most recent change datetime must be
listed at the end.
The format is based on the <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> document format introduced by the Sitemap protocol.
It has the <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> root element and the following structure:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The mandatory <code>&lt;rs:md&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> must have a <code>capability</code> attribute that has a
value of <code>change-notification</code>. It also has the mandatory <code>from</code> and <code>until</code> attributes.
The <code>from</code> attribute indicates that the change notification includes all changes that occurred to the set of resources at the Source
since the datetime expressed as the value of the attribute. The  <code>until</code> attribute indicates that the change notification
includes all changes that occurred to the set of resources at the Source up until the datetime expressed as the value of the attribute.
Consecutive change notifications sent by the Source must cover consecutive and non-overlapping temporal <code>from</code>/<code>until</code>
intervals. This allows a Destination to verify whether it received all change notifications and to process them in the appropriate order
in case they were not received in the order the Source sent them.
</li>
 <li>The optional <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> points to the Capability List with the relation type
<code>up</code>.</li>
 <li>One <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> for each resource change. This element does not have attributes, but uses
child elements to convey information about the changed resource. The <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element has the following child elements:
 <ul>
  <li>A mandatory <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code> child element provides the URI of the changed resource.</li>
  <li>An optional <code>&lt;lastmod&gt;</code> child element with semantics as described in
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DocumentFormats">Section 7 of the core specification</a>.
</li>
  <li>A mandatory <code>&lt;rs:md&gt;</code> child element must have the attribute <code>change</code> to convey the nature of the change.
Its value can be <code>created</code>, <code>updated</code>, or <code>deleted</code>. It has the optional <code>datetime</code> attribute to
convey the datetime of the change, as described in <a href="/rs/resourcesync#DocumentFormats">Section 7 of the core specification</a>.
The <code>&lt;rs:md&gt;</code> child element can further have attributes <code>hash</code>, <code>length</code>, and <code>type</code>,
as described in <a href="/rs/resourcesync#DocumentFormats">Section 7 of the core specification</a>.</li>
  <li>Optional <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child elements link to related resources as described in
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#DocumentFormats">Section 7</a> and
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#LinkRelRes">Section 14 of the core specification</a>.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
Change notifications do not use the <code>&lt;sitemapindex&gt;</code> document format
introduced by the Sitemap protocol. In the event that there are a very large number
of simultaneous changes at a Source, the notifications must be split into a sequence
of change notifications using <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> documents.
</p>

<h2>4. <a name="Transport">Transport Protocol: WebSub</a></h2>

<p>In order to bootstrap the notification capabilities of the ResourceSync framework, a single
transport protocol is chosen: <a href="#ref-websub">WebSub</a>. WebSub is a simple,
HTTP-based publish/subscribe protocol that is expected to perform well for use cases
that do not require change notifications to be sent at a very high frequency.</p>

<p>The below description of the use of WebSub for Change
Notifications is essentially the same as the description of its use for
<a href="framework_notification">Framework Notifications</a>.
However, in the interest of self-containdeness of the respective specifications,
and because Change Notifications and Framework Notifications must be sent on
different channels, the description is repeated in both specifications.</p>

<p><a href="#tab_2">Table 2</a> maps terminology used in ResourceSync and WebSub. In order to implement
the publish/subscribe paradigm, WebSub introduces a <code>hub</code> that acts as a conduit between Source and Destination.
A hub can be operated by the Source itself or by a third party. It is uniquely identified by the <code>hub URI</code>.
WebSub's <code>topic</code> corresponds with the notion of channel used in this specification.
A topic is uniquely identified by its <code>topic URI</code>. Hence,
per set of resources, the Source has a dedicated topic (and hence topic URI) for change notifications.</p>

<p>The remainder of this section describes the use of WebSub in ResourceSync. It only provides
the information about the WebSub protocol that is essential to gain an adequate understanding of the
overall mechanism. Details about the WebSub protocol are available in the
<a href="#ref-websub">WebSub</a> specification.
<a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a> shows an overview of HTTP interactions between Source, Hub, and Destination. They will be detailed
in the remainder of this section.
</p>

<img alt="HTTP interactions between Source, Hub, and Destination" src="img/websub.png"/>
<p class="caption">Figure 3: HTTP interactions between Source, Hub, and Destination</p>
</div>

<h3>4.1. <a name="Source2Hub">Source Submits Notifications to Hub</a></h3>

<p>The WebSub protocol provides no specific guidelines regarding the way in which a Source should communicate
notifications to a hub. The mechanism for ResourceSync change notifications is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each set of resources, the Source has a dedicated topic URI
for its change notifications. The response to an HTTP HEAD/GET request issued against
a topic URI must have an HTTP "200 OK" response code, an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code>
header with a value of <code>application/xml</code>, and an HTTP Link header with the
following links:
 <ul>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>self</code> relation type
 that provides the topic URI for the submitted notification
 as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>hub</code> relation type
 that provides the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 </ul>
<span>The resource identified by the topic URI must have the same
<code>Content-Type</code> (<code>application/xml</code>) as the payload of the
notification. If the intention is to serve content at the topic URI
the payload of the most recent notification may be suitable. If no
content is provided at the topic URI the response header <code>Content-Length</code>
with the value <code>0</code> should be returned. This communication is shown
as "Hub verifies topic URI" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>.</span>
</li>
<li>A Source submits the payload for a change notification to a hub.
The notification payload is provided as the body of an HTTP POST issued against the hub URI.
This HTTP POST must have an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header with a value of <code>application/xml</code> and
an HTTP Link header with the following links:
 <ul>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>self</code> relation type
 that provides the topic URI for the submitted notification
 as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 <li>A mandatory link with the <code>hub</code> relation type
 that provides the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
 </ul>
This is shown as the right pointing arrow of "Source notifies Hub" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>.
</li>
<li>The hub, if operated by a third party, may want to verify whether the HTTP POST was submitted by a legitimate Source.
The hub can do so by establishing a trust relationship with the Source prior to relaying any of its notifications,
for example, through a one time registration mechanism. Once the Hub is relaying notifications, it can still check
 whether the Source adheres to the WebSub protocol. This is the case if all the following hold:
 <ul>
 <li>The HTTP POST contains an HTTP Link header with the aformentioned links.</li>
 <li>The response to an HTTP HEAD/GET issued against the topic URI contains an HTTP Link header with the aformentioned links.</li>
 </ul>
<li>The hub responds to the submission of the payload for a change notification as follows:</li>
 <ul>
 <li>The response must have HTTP "200 OK" status code if the submission was successful.</li>
 <li>The response must have a HTTP 3XX, 4XX or 5XX status code if the submission was not successful.</li>
 </ul>
This is shown as the left pointing arrow of "Source notifies Hub" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>.
</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="#ex_2">Example 2</a> shows the HTTP POST issued by the Source against its hub to submit the
change notification payload of <a href="#ex_1">Example 1</a>. For brevity, the payload is not shown
in its entirety. The third party hub URI is <code>http://hub.example.org/websub/</code>
and the Source's topic URI (channel) for change notifications pertaining to dataset1 is
<code>http://example.com/dataset1/change/</code>.</p>

<h3>4.2. <a name="Destination2Hub">Destination Subscribes to Hub to Receive Notifications</a></h3>

<p>A Destination subscribes to a Source's topic using the process described in the section
"Subscribing and Unsubscribing" of <a href="#ref-websub">WebSub</a>.
The process consists of mandatory subscription request and subscription verification phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the subscription request phase, shown as "subscription" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>,
the Destination indicates it wants to subscribe to notifications
pertaining to a Source's topic URI (channel). In order to do so, a Destination
provides a form as the body of an HTTP POST issued against the hub URI.
This HTTP POST must have an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header with a value of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> and
the form contains the following information:
<ul>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.callback</code> parameter that has as value the Destination's callback URI, that is
the URI to which the hub should submit the notifications pertaining to the Source's topic URI.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.mode</code> parameter that has as value <code>subscribe</code>.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.topic</code> parameter that has as value the Source's topic URI
that the Destination wants to subscribe to.</li>
<li>The optional <code>hub.lease_seconds</code> parameter that has as value the number of seconds
that the Destination desires the subscription to remain active. A Destination that provides a value needs to be aware
that it may or may not be honored by the hub.</li>
</ul>
The hub must respond to a subscription request with an HTTP "202 Accepted" response code
as an indication that the request was received and will be verified.
</li>
<li>In the subscription verification phase, shown as "verification" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>,
the hub verifies whether the Destination genuinely intended to subscribe,
and whether the Destination has control over the callback URI it provided.
In order to do so, the hub issues an HTTP GET against the Destination's callback URI with the following
query string arguments appended to it:
<ul>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.mode</code> parameter that has as value <code>subscribe</code>.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.topic</code> parameter that has as value the topic URI given in the subscription request.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.challenge</code> parameter that has as value a hub-generated random string.</li>
<li>The mandatory <code>hub.lease_seconds</code> parameter that has as value the
number of seconds that the hub will keep the subscription active. This actual
subscription period may differ arbitrarily from what the Destination requested.
It is recommended that the duration of a subscription granted should not be
less than 300 seconds (5 minutes) and should not be more than 2678400 seconds
(1 month). Although these suggested limits are somewhat arbitrary, the lower limit is
intended to prevent overload by frequent subscription renewals, whereas the
upper limit is chosen to ensure that non-cancelled subscriptions expire within a
foreseeable period. In order to maintain a continuous subscription, a Destination
must take note of the granted subscription period, and it must issue a new
subscription request before the indicated period expires if it wants to keep
receiving notifications.
</li>
</ul>
The subscriber confirms its intention to subscribe by sending a response that has an HTTP 2XX status code
and that has the value of the <code>hub.challenge</code> as its body. Any other response indicates that
there was no intent to subscribe. .
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#ex_3">Example 3</a> shows the HTTP POST issued by a Destination against the hub URI
<code>http://hub.example.org/websub/</code> requesting a subscription to the Source's
topic URI (channel) <code>http://example.com/dataset1/change/</code>

<code>http://destination.example.net/callback/</code>.</p>

<h3>4.3. <a name="Hub2Destination">Hub Delivers Notifications to Destination</a></h3>

<p>When the hub receives a change notification from the Source,
it passes it on to the subscribing Destination(s).
The process, shown as "Hub notifies Destination" in <a href="#fig_websub">Figure 3</a>, is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The hub provides the notification payload received from the Source as the body of an
HTTP POST issued against the Destination's callback URI.
This HTTP POST must have an HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header with a value of <code>application/xml</code> and
an HTTP Link header with the following links:
<ul>
<li>A mandatory link with the <code>self</code> relation type
that provides the topic URI (channel) for the notification
as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
<li>A mandatory link with the <code>hub</code> relation type
that provides the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<li>The successful response from the Destination's callback URI must be have an HTTP 2XX code.
The hub must consider all other subscriber response codes as failures.</li>
<li>The Destination may want to verify the payload received from the Hub, for example, confirming that it is
valid XML, has a <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> root element, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="#ex_6">Example 6</a> shows the HTTP POST that the hub issues
against the Destination's callback URI to relay the
notification it received from the Source in <a href="#ex_2">Example 2</a>.
For brevity, the payload is not shown in its entirety. </p>

<h3>4.4. <a name="Destination4Hub">Destination Unsubscribes from Hub</a></h3>

<p>The mechanism by which a Destination unsubscribes from a Source's topic URI is as
described in <a href="#Source2Hub">Section 4.1</a> but uses <code>unsubscribe</code> as the value of
<code>hub.mode</code> instead of <code>subscribe</code>.</p>


<h2>5. <a name="AdvNotChan">Advertising Change Notification Channels</a></h2>
<p>
Change Notification capabilities are advertised via Capability Lists, as is the case with
the capabilities defined in the <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core ResourceSync specification</a>.
As each set of resources has its dedicated Change Notification channel, that channel is advertised
in the Capability List that corresponds with the respective set of resources.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#fig_notification_disco">Figure 4</a> displays a Change Notification channel advertised
in a Capability List. The figure shows a structure with only one Capability List that advertises its designated
Change Notification channel. Other Capability Lists,
each of which pertain to a different set of resources, would advertise their respective notification channels.
In addition to Change Notifications, the Capability
List can advertise other capabilities such as a Resource List and Change List as introduced
in the <a href="/rs/resourcesync">core specification</a>,
and archive capabilities as introduced in the
<a href="/rs/archives">archiving specification</a>.
</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 4: Change Notification channel discovery</p>
</div>

<p>
<a href="#ex_7">Example 7</a> shows the Capability List from
<a href="/rs/resourcesync#ex_13">Example 13 of the core specification</a> with discovery links for a
Change Notification channel added.
The WebSub topic URI is provided in the <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code> element, whereas the
hub URI is provided using a <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> child element of <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code>.
That <code>&lt;rs:ln&gt;</code> must have <code>hub</code> as the value of the <code>rel</code> attribute
and the hub URI as the value of the <code>href</code> attribute.
Note the introduction of
the <code>change-notification</code> value for the <code>capability</code> attribute to
indicate the Change Notification capability.
