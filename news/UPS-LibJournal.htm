Dear Herbert:

Here is the piece which ran in the Library Journal Academic Newswire.  I
would of course appreciate keeping the lines of communications open in the
future regarding the UPS initiative.  The library community is most
interested in your developments and I would like to be able to report
periodically on what's new.

Once again, many thanks for your comments.

DIGITAL LIBRARIANS HOLD FIRST MEETING OF UPS INITIATIVE
Digital librarians involved with the Universal Preprint 
Service Initiative (UPS), a project with far-reaching 
implications for the future of scholarly communications, 
came away from their first meeting in Santa Fe, NM, having 
made significant strides toward creating "interoperability" 
among digital archives throughout the world.  The ambitious 
project, which brought together the world's leading digital 
information specialists, seeks to bring "some level of 
compatibility between [digital archives]," says Herbert Van 
de Sompel, one of the initiative's organizers. This is the 
key to making electronic archives more central to scholarly 
research. "Scholarly communication via digital archives," 
says Van de Sompel (of the University of Ghent, Belgium),  
"can only become a true part of scholarly communication if 
there is some kind of interoperability between them."

According to Van de Sompel, a set of "architectural, 
technical, and organizational recommendations," to be known 
as the Santa Fe Conventions, were set forth and adopted by 
the digital archives with representatives at the meeting.  
"As a result of that," says Van de Sompel, "we can expect 
the emergence of a multi-disciplinary search engine for 
eprint material originating from those existing archives.  
And as more existing archives implement the 
recommendations, the reach of such a search engine will 
grow."

But just how big of an impact will the UPS Inititaive have 
on the changing landscape of scholarly communications? 
"That is a very difficult question to answer, since none of 
us have the ability to predict the future," says Van de 
Sompel.  "But I somehow have the feeling that our 
Initiative has set some things on fire.... [it is] is one 
of an ever increasing number of initiatives that strive for 
a change in scholarly communication.  At some point a 
convergence of several of these initiatives will get things 
right. [Whether or] not...our initiative [is] part of that 
convergent group,...I truly hope that we are contributing 
to the convergence as such."
