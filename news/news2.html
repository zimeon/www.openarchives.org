<dd>On March 2, the Rosetta Disk left Earth on board an Ariane-5 rocket
from the European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guyana. The mission's
target is the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which will be reached in
2014 after a &quot;billiard ball&quot; journey through the Solar
System lasting more than ten years. The Rosetta Disk is a modern
version of the Rosetta Stone. The 2-inch nickel disk is micro-etched
with 30,000 pages of information covering over 1,000 languages. For
each language there is a simple dictionary, a guide to pronunciation
and counting, and a traditional story with translation.
Additionally, to help language decipherment in remote futures, a
translation of a common text (the first three chapters of the book
of Genesis) is provided in all languages. The disk can be read with
the aid of an optical microscope. The materials on the disk come
from the <a href="http://www.rosettaproject.org/live/search/languagesearch">Rosetta

<dd>OSI is pleased to announce the release of the Guide to Institutional Repository
Software. The guide describes the five open source, OAI-compliant

so that each institution could select the software best suited to meet
its needs. Included in the guide is a brief narrative overview of each
system followed by a summary of the systems technical features.

the Google SOAP API to search for possible baseURLs (surprisingly 
this yielded 30+ new provider sites).</dd>

<dt>June 2003 -- <a name="DLESE">DLESE OAI Software</a>.</dt>
<dd>The Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) is pleased to 
announce its latest version of OAI software. The DLESE OAI software 
is designed to be simple to install, configure and use and includes 
both a data provider and harvester. The data provider serves 
metadata from XML files, automatically updating what is provided 
whenever the XML files change. The harvester likewise saves 
harvested metadata to files. The software supports the OAI-PHM v2.0. 
In addition, the data provider exposes its metadata to outside 
clients as a web service through an Open Digital Libraries (ODL) 
search interface. Remote clients can perform keyword search queries 
over the metadata using the ODL search interface and receive an 
ordered list of matching records within the standard OAI-PMH XML 
response. The software is packaged as a Java WAR file for use in a 
servlet environment such as Tomcat and will run on UNIX, Windows and 
Mac OS X. The software is available under the GPL open source 
license. A full list of features and information is available at:
<a href="http://dlese.org/oai/docs/index.html">

replaces the former distributed-searching based NTRS. NTRS is a 
public service that provides access to &quot;unclassified, unlimited&quot; 
NASA-authored scientific and technical information. In addition, 
NTRS also harvests from a select number of non-NASA OAI 
repositories. In total, NTRS holds &gt; 540k metadata records.  
NTRS is also an OAI-PMH aggregator and re-exports its holdings. The 
baseURL for NTRS is <a href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/">

<dd>The California Digital Library announced that its groundbreaking 
eScholarship Repository has reached several major milestones. The 
eScholarship Repository (http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship/

for depositing working papers, technical reports, research results, 
datasets with commentary and peer-reviewed series. It is free for 
scholars to upload papers and free to users to download them. 
Compliance with the Open Archive Initiative (OAI) metadata

<dd>HP Labs and MIT Libraries are pleased to announce that version 1.0 of the 
DSpace institutional repository software platform is available for 
download, evaluation, and use. DSpace is an open source digital 
asset management software platform that enables institutions to 
capture and describe digital works using a submission workflow 
module; distribute an institution's digital works over the web 
through a search and retrieval system; and store and preserve 
digital works over the long term. DSpace runs on a variety of 
hardware platforms, and supports OAI-PMH version 2.0. MIT Libraries 
has deployed DSpace 1.0 in full production at MIT and is actively 
working with seven other institutions in the US, Canada and the UK

innovation in the provision of academic information in the 
Netherlands.
<a href="http://www.surf.nl/en/actueel/index2.php?oid=7">DARE 
(Digital Academic Repositories)</a> is a collective initiative by 
the Dutch universities to make all their research results digitally

Koninklijke Nederlandse Academie van Wetenschappen [Royal 
Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences] and the Nederlandse 
Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) [Netherlands

visibility of and access to Dutch academic research leave much to be 
desired. In the fast-changing world of academic research and 
communications, changes are needed if the Netherlands wants to 
maintain its position in the academic world. Linking up with

<dt><a name="oaister2">July 2002 -- OAIster Search Interface</a>. </dt>
<dd>The University of Michigan Libraries Digital Library Production 
Service is pleased to announce the launch of the OAIster search interface,  
version 1. (<a href="http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/b/bib/bib-idx?c=oaister;page=simple">http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/b/bib/bib-idx?c=oaister;page=simple</a>). 
OAIster has harvested a large number of records from a variety of 
institutions -- 274046 records from 55 institutions -- that have 
made these records available using the OAI protocol. Each of these 
records leads to an actual digital resource hosted at an 
institution. You can learn more about a particular institution's 
collection we are harvesting at
<a href="http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/viewcolls.html">
http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/viewcolls.html</a>.  We are also 
committed to improving our service -- see our future plans and the 
progress we are making at
<a href="http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/phase2.html">
http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/phase2.html</a>. We are very 
interested in gathering more records, OAI-enabled or snapshots of 
records that aren't yet OAI-enabled, to include in our service. The 
more records we serve, the more valuable this service becomes for 
the end-user. Please get in touch with
<a href="mailto:khage@umich.edu">khage@umich.edu</a> to discuss this 
further.</dd>
