<P><font size="+3">D</font>igital publishing is in an adolescent phase, trying to figure out
just what it wants to be when it
grows up. Its guardians are seeking to
guide its development through judicious investment of resources and discipline while trying to avoid excessive
constraints on its creative evolution.
And like parents everywhere, the guardians keep trying new and better
ways to do things.</P>
<P>Several events last month illustrate these efforts. For example, the
<A HREF="http://www.arl.org/sparc/index.html" TARGET="_top">Scholarly Publishing &amp; Academic
Resources Coalition</A>
 (SPARC)
named three nascent digital publishing projects that will share
$519,000 in development grants
over the next three years. SPARC, a
library alliance based in Washington, D.C., that promotes competition in the publishing marketplace,
also hosted a meeting for members
to examine new models for scholarly communication. And a new
group that is trying to ensure compatibility among online preprint services and promote their acceptance
held its first meeting.</P>

<P>Along with improved technology, a major driver behind all this
activity is the "journals crisis," in
which the ever-increasing price of
periodicals is forcing libraries to
cancel some subscriptions in order to afford the remaining ones. The
cost of a library subscription for a single
science journal can run into five figures--enough for a down payment on a house in
some regions of the U.S., noted one librarian at the SPARC meeting. Confronted with such comparisons, she said, academics at her campus don't kick up much
of a fuss when she is forced to cancel an
expensive subscription. Another librarian
said that faculty members at her university have responded to such cost-cutting
measures by saying, "Fine. We'll start our
own journal!"</P>
<P>Starting alternatives to expensive journals is an approach that's getting support
from SPARC. Through Scientific Communities Initiative grants, the organization intends to "spur digital science publishing ventures based in academe"
(C&amp;EN, April 5, page 10). Following are
the first recipients, which were announced at SPARC's meeting:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/images/entities/bull.gif"  BORDER=0 > Massachusetts Institute of Technology's "MIT CogNet" web site 
<A HREF="http://cognet.mit.edu" TARGET="_top">(http://cognet.mit.edu),</A>
 which bills itself as an
electronic community for the cognitive
and brain sciences and is already up and
running. It offers a searchable, full-text
online library that includes journals, reference works, and abstracts of conference papers; a monthly editorial from an
invited contributor, linked to responses
from readers; seminar listings and online
discussion forums that can alert users
when a new posting is added; member
profiles that are intended to prompt those
with similar interests to correspond with
each other; and job listings.

Earthscape" 
<A HREF="http://www.earthscape.org" TARGET="_top">(http://www.earthscape.
org),</A>
 an earth sciences web site that is undergoing beta testing to get the glitches
out. The site serves as a science and public policy resource for researchers, teachers, students, and decisionmakers. Content includes lectures, conference proceedings, curriculum models and virtual
labs, maps, and journal abstracts. Animation of a tidal wave and a live online "webcast" of an environmental conference are
among the offerings.
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/images/entities/bull.gif"  BORDER=0 > The University of California's
"eScholarship" (accessible via 
<A HREF="http://www.cdlib.org" TARGET="_top">http://www.cdlib.org),</A>
 which will be launched
in January 2000 as a mechanism for
scholars to experiment with new kinds of
publication. Initially, it will create a second, more sophisticated access point to
Los Alamos National Laboratory's
(LANL) nonrefereed "e-print server,"
where researchers post free digital preprints of physics, math, and computer science papers 
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov" TARGET="_top">(http://xxx.lanl.gov).</A>
Other disciplines--potentially including chemistry--will be included in the UC site. Scholarly societies and other third parties will be
able to create scholarly products
based on this material, such as a
new electronic journal or an alerting service.

</P>
<P>These examples represent just
a small sampling of the numerous
online ventures that are sprouting
up. The digital publishing community, while welcoming the vigorous and widespread growth of
such projects, is mindful that the
situation is becoming chaotic.
John Ober, director for education
and applied research at UC's California Digital Library in Oakland,
Calif., and one of the designers of
the eScholarship program, tells
C&amp;EN that this isn't all bad. "Chaos allows a lot of ideas to germinate, and nobody knows for sure
which will be the most effective or
efficient or useful ideas." Some sense of
direction is developing, however.
"Things are coalescing around the e-print
server model as a way to change scholarly communication," he observes.</P>
<P>Ober believes that it is important for
the groups exploring these frontiers to
take note of one another and to work together. "They shouldn't be just islands
unto themselves." SPARC is setting a
good example, he says, not only by encouraging development of new models
but also by bringing people together to
share their insights.</P>
<P>For instance, SPARC and its parent organization, the Association of Research
Libraries, helped sponsor the first meeting concerning the 
<A HREF="http://vole.lanl.gov/ups" TARGET="_top">Universal Preprint
Service</A>
 (UPS) initiative, held last month
in Santa Fe. Herbert Van de Sompel,
head of library automation at the University of Ghent, in Belgium, says this initiative is meant to "promote the use of electronic preprint archives as a way to communicate scholarly information. By
promoting the use of those archives, it is
hoped that a fundamental, free layer of
scholarly information can be created.
Above this free layer, nonprofit and commercial services can flourish." Van de
Sompel, along with Paul H. Ginsparg, a
physicist who set up LANL's e-print server in 1991, and Richard E. Luce, LANL's
research library director, formally proposed the UPS initiative in August 1999.</P>

<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial,Univers" SIZE="-1"><B>From left: Luce, Van de Sompel, and Ginsparg collaborated on the UPS initiative.</B></FONT> 
<P>Van de Sompel favors a scenario in
which university libraries would archive
nonrefereed information created by authors at their institution and make it
available worldwide for free. Then commercial companies, scholarly societies,
and other entities could develop overlay
services, such as a peer review function,
for which they could charge users. With
that setup, he explained at the SPARC
meeting, readers can choose which
kind of information they use, depending
on their needs and budgets.</P>
<P>There is much to be done before
such models can succeed. For instance,
"it is not enough to just create e-print archives," Van de Sompel tells C&amp;EN. "In
order to achieve a functional communication mechanism, these archives need
to be compatible to a certain degree."
This was one of the main issues tackled
at the UPS meeting.</P>
<P>The goal for UPS, according to the
initiative's three proposers, is to develop
"conventions that archives could adopt
to ensure that they work together so
that any paper in any of these archives
could be found from anyone's desktop
worldwide, as if it were all in one virtual
public library."</P>

<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial,Univers" SIZE="-1"><B>[Photo by Sophie Wilkinson]</B></FONT>
<P>In order to do this, participants must
work out the technical logistics of providing access to data tucked away in all
these different archive sources. UPS
meeting attendees proposed that searches be carried out via a "harvesting" approach. In such an approach, Luce explains, trusted parties would selectively
collect data from different archives.
Those involved in setting up and using
the archives will need to agree on protocols and criteria for this selective harvesting, as well as formats for the metadata
that will be used to tag and retrieve material from the archives.</P>
<P>These kinds of activities will no doubt
broaden the responsibilities of libraries.
In addition to aggregation, "libraries have
a new role to play as scholarly publishers," according to James G. Neal, dean of
university libraries at Johns Hopkins University. In addition, "we need to find ways
to partner more aggressively in the research community and to bring the
knowledge management skills that we
have to the research world of the university," he said at the SPARC meeting. Libraries could offer alumni or independent
scholars access to lifelong learning programs, for example. Neal suggested that
libraries could bring in income through
such nontraditional roles.</P>
<P>Other suggestions raised in small
group discussions during the SPARC
meeting included providing scholars with
greater online access to back literature.
One model is JSTOR 
<A HREF="http://www.jstor.org" TARGET="_top">(http://www.
jstor.org),</A>
 which makes back issues of
some scholarly journals available electronically, though it doesn't yet include
journals in the physical sciences.
</P>
<P>Another participant noted that authors aren't taking advantage of the
unique multimedia features that online
journals permit because they lack the
skills to do so. He recommended that
these researchers be given training,
perhaps by editors.</P>
<P>An additional proposal was to use
"push" technology to keep users informed about the subjects and authors
they are interested in. In this scenario,
readers could indicate this information to
service providers. Additionally, the service could analyze the reading habits of
the user and similar researchers, much
as Amazon.com tracks its shoppers' preferences. Based on this data, the service
would make educated guesses about
what further information the researcher
might be interested in, then periodically
send the researcher an electronic package of this selected material.</P>
<P>Such tantalizing suggestions indicate
that digital publishing is bursting with potential, much of it as yet unrealized. Understandably, many of the early online
products have simply replicated their
hard copy progenitors in the digital
realm. But clearly--as SPARC and others
are showing--the future lies in new
means of communication.<IMG SRC="/cen/dpmtest/ltrif.gif"  BORDER=0 ></P>
