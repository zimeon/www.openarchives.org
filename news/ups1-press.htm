<h2><B><font color="#000000">Executive Summary</font></B></h2>
<P> <font size="2" color="#000000">The Open Archives initiative has been set up 
  to create a forum to discuss and solve matters of interoperability between author 
  self-archiving solutions, as a way to promote their global acceptance (see <a href="http://www.openarchives.org">http://www.openarchives.org</a> 
  ).</font> 
<P><font size="2" color="#000000">The first, largest and most important such archive 
  is the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Physics Archive. Founded by Paul 
  Ginsparg in 1991, LANL now houses over 100,000 papers, mirrored worldwide in 
  15 countries with over 50,000 users daily and still growing (see <a href="http://arXiv.org/cgi-bin/show_stats">http://arXiv.org/cgi-bin/show_stats</a> 
  ). Other disciplines and institutions have begun to create public research archives 
  along the lines of LANL but what is needed are conventions that archives could 
  adopt to ensure that they work together so that any paper in any of these archives 
  could be found from anyone's desktop worldwide, as if it were all in one virtual 
  public library.</font> 
<P><font size="2" color="#000000">The participants in the meeting were digital 
  librarians and computer scientists specializing in archiving, metadata, and 
  interoperability, and they included the founders of the principal public research 
  archives that exist so far. The participants were diverse in their underlying 
  motivations, but entirely unified in their objective of paving the way for universal 
  public archiving of the scientific and scholarly research literature on the 
  Web. </font>
<P><font size="2" color="#000000">The group agreed on minimal technical requirements 
  for archives. These will be published separately as the &quot;Santa Fe Conventions&quot; 
  and, in the next six months, will be implemented in the existing archives.</font> 
<h2> <B>Technical Summary</B></h2>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>The first meeting concentrated on the creation of cross-archive 
  end-user services. The aim was to try and identify general architectural and 
  technical characteristics of archive solutions, that would facilitate the creation 
  of such services. These characteristics could then be used as recommendations 
  for existing and upcoming initiatives.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>The meeting started off with a presentation and demonstration 
  by a team consisting of Herbert Van de Sompel (University of Ghent and Los Alamos 
  National Laboratory), Michael Nelson (NASA Langley and Old Dominion University) 
  and Thomas Krichel (University of Surrey and RePEc initiative). This group had 
  built an experimental end-user service providing access to data originating 
  from main archive initiatives (arXiv, RePEc, NCSTRL, NDLTD, NTRS). A variety 
  of technologies were used in the project, including NCSTRL+ as the digital library 
  service, intelligent objects called buckets as a means to store the archive 
  metadata and the SFX linking solution as a means to interlink the eprint data 
  with the traditional scholarly communication mechanism. The presentation identified 
  problems that arose during the project, and discussion of those served to launch 
  the meeting. This presentation was followed by position papers on interoperability 
  issues presented by Carl Lagoze (Cornell University), Kurt Maly (Old Dominion 
  University), Ed Fox (Virginia Tech) and Caroline Arms (Library of Congress).</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> 
  </FONT> 
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Following the initial presentations, there was a panel discussion 
  in which Paul Ginsparg (Los Alamos National Laboratory), Paul Gherman (Vanderbilt 
  University), Eric Van de Velde (CalTech) and John Ober (University of California) 
  expressed their opinion on the possible pros and cons of institutional versus 
  discipline-oriented archive initiatives. The group concluded that many different 
  archive initiatives were likely to emerge, with different conceptual, organizational 
  and technical foundations. In order for such initiatives to successfully become 
  part of the scholarly communication system, interoperability was seen as a crucial 
  factor.</FONT> 
<P><font size="2">The group agreed that interoperability hinges on a fundamental 
  distinction between the archive-functions, which include data-collection and 
  maintenance and end-user functions, like the cross-system search and linking 
  prototype service described in the opening session. Although archive initiatives 
  can implement their own end-user services, it is essential that the archives 
  remain "open" in order to allow others to equally create such services. This 
  concept was formalized in the distinction between providers of data (the archive 
  initiatives) and implementers of data services (the initiatives that want to 
  create end-user services for archive initiatives). Stimulated by a presentation 
  by Thomas Krichel, the group agreed that an essential feature of the Santa Fe 
  Conventions would be that providers of data use a standard mechanism to state 
  the conditions under which their datasets can be used by implementers of data 
  services. Similarly, the implementers of data services could describe the use 
  they make of archive data. </font> 
<P><FONT SIZE=2>This organizational argument was followed by a discussion on the 
  technicalities of creating end-user services for data originating from different 
  archives. The group recognized that there are basically two ways to implement 
  these: a distributed searching approach and a harvesting approach. The former 
  would require archives to implement a joint distributed search protocol, which 
  is not considered to be a low-entry requirement. Moreover, the technical experts 
  recognized that there are important problems of scale when implementing such 
  distributed search solutions, in light of the possible emergence of thousands 
  of institutional and/or subject-oriented archives worldwide. As such, the group 
  decided this was not a realistic approach at this point in time. Therefore, 
  as in the experimental project presented at the beginning of the meeting, a 
  harvesting solution was proposed. Such a harvesting solution would allow trusted 
  parties - the ones that subscribe to the Santa Fe Conventions - to selectively 
  collect data from different archives. It was identified that such a technique 
  requires an understanding regarding:</FONT> 
<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2>Protocols to selectively harvest data;</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2>Criteria that can be used to selectively harvest data;</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2>Metadata formats that are used by archive solutions to respond 
    to harvesting requests.</FONT> 
</UL>
<p><FONT SIZE=2>It was recognized that providers of data could describe the details 
  of these interfaces in standard ways thus enabling implementers of data to create 
  archive-specific harvesters. Still, the group decided to go one step further 
  and to highly recommend the following:</FONT> </p>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2> Protocols to selectively harvest data: implementation of part 
    of the Dienst protocol in order to achieve a uniform way to poll an archive 
    for its logical division(s) (subarchives) and to selectively harvest data 
    from these divisions.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2> Criteria that can be used to selectively harvest data: there 
    should at least be support for a bulk harvest of all data from an archive, 
    as well as a mechanism to harvest based on accession date. Other harvesting 
    criteria that were thought to be important included author affiliation, subject, 
    publication type.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2> Metadata formats that are used by archive solutions to respond 
    to harvesting requests: It is recognized that archives will use (an) internal 
    metadata format(s) best suited to deal with the material to be described. 
    Still, the group decided to propose a minimal Dublin Core compliant metadata 
    set, called the Santa Fe Set, that should be made available by all archives. 
    It is desirable that archives are able to respond to harvesting requests with 
    data delivered in both the internal metadata format as in the Santa Fe Set 
    format.</FONT> 
</UL>
<P> <FONT SIZE=2></FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>The representatives of existing archive 
  initiatives at the meeting as well as those from institutions that are in the 
  process of setting up archive initiatives agreed to comply to those guidelines. 
  The Dienst protocol will be enhanced to allow for the functions mentioned above 
  and a minimal Dienst release facilitating the process of making an archive compliant 
  to the required aspects of Dienst will be made available. A transport format 
  for MARC-formatted metadata will be proposed, as well as an XML DTD for the 
  description of the Santa Fe Set. The recommendations will be extensively documented 
  on a Web site. Adoption of the recommendations will be promoted worldwide.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> 
  </FONT> 
<h2> <b>The way forward</b><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT> </h2>
<UL>
  <LI><font size="2">The minimal Dienst protocol set will be implemented for all 
    archives that were represented at the meeting. This will allow for a first 
    round of experimentation with the creation of end-user services layered over 
    existing archives.</font> 
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2>The group identified the urgent need to discuss the mechanisms 
    used to submit material to archives. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2> </FONT> 
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2>Paul Ginsparg suggested that a next meeting should be held 
    in Europe, in the first quarter of next year.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2>It was also thought to be important to have a presentation 
    and/or workshop on the Open Archives Initiative at the ACM 2000 Conference 
    on Digital Libraries as well as at the European ECDLC.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2>The experimental, non-productional prototype that was presented 
    at the meeting will temporarily be available for exploration at the beginning 
    of November 1999 at <a href="http://ups.cs.odu.edu">http://ups.cs.odu.edu</a> 
    . The representatives of Old Dominion University, the Research Library of 
    the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of Ghent expressed their 
    interest in continuing this prototyping work.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT SIZE=2>The UPS Initiative has been renamed. From now on it is the 
    Open Archives initiative.</FONT>
