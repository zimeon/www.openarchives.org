      <p><font size="2">Washington, D.C.—The Open Archives Initiative (OAi) has 
        established a steering committee to guide its development and promote 
        its adoption as an enabling framework for the development of innovative 
        networked information services. In addition, the Coalition for Networked 
        Information (CNI) and the Digital Library Federation (DLF) have agreed 
        jointly to supply some organized support and resources for the ongoing 
        OAi effort.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The OAi has its genesis in an October 1999 meeting held 
        in Santa Fe, New Mexico, under the sponsorship of the Council on Library 
        and Information Resources (CLIR), the DLF, the Scholarly Publishing and 
        Academic Resources Coalition, the Association of Research Libraries, and 
        the Research Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Focusing on 
        the interoperation of "e-print archives" (collections of electronic journal 
        articles and preprints), the OAi discussed an approach known as metadata 
        harvesting. In this approach, there are data providers and service providers. 
        Data providers (such as individual e-print archives) support a simple 
        harvesting protocol and provide extracts of metadata in a common, minimal-level 
        format in response to requests from service providers. Service providers 
        use extracted metadata to build higher level, user-oriented services, 
        such as catalogs and portals to materials distributed across multiple 
        e-print sites. The approach and its protocols were documented in the &quot;<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_entry.htm">Santa 
        Fe convention</a>,&quot; along with preliminary ideas about acceptable 
        use policies, registries, and other issues. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">A subsequent workshop, held in conjunction with the ACM 
        Digital Libraries meeting in San Antonio in June 2000, reviewed experiences 
        in implementing the Santa Fe convention and mapped out issues that needed 
        to be addressed. Out of that meeting came a consensus that the Santa Fe 
        convention will be revised and updated with the intent of producing a 
        new version of the document by January 2001. The newly established steering 
        committee will oversee these efforts and will assemble technical experts 
        as required.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In addition, there is considerable interest in extending 
        the concepts developed at the Santa Fe convention beyond their initial 
        context in order to support metadata harvesting for a wider range of digital 
        resources of academic and scholarly interest. Besides e-prints and electronic 
        texts, such resources include science and social science data sets, visual 
        materials, archival collections, geographic information system data, sound 
        and music, and video. This work is being pursued under the auspices of 
        the DLF, with support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Unlike the 
        project involving the e-print archives, this effort is still highly experimental 
        and requires validation through implementation experience. The steering 
        committee will also help to guide the integration of this effort into 
        the further evolution of the Santa Fe convention. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2">The Digital Library Federation is a partnership of research 
        libraries dedicated to creating, maintaining, expanding, and preserving 
        a distributed collection of digital materials accessible to scholars and 
        to a wider public. It operates under the umbrella of CLIR, which works 
        in partnership with libraries, archives, and other information providers 
        to advocate collaborative approaches to preserving the nation’s intellectual 
        heritage and strengthening the many components of its information system.

        to advance the transformative promise of networked information technology 
        for the advancement of scholarly communication and the enrichment of intellectual 
        productivity. </font><font size="2">Founded in 1990 by the Association 
        of Research Libraries, Educom, and CAUSE, CNI is supported by the members

        and library organizations. CNI works on issues related to the themes of 
        developing networked information content; transforming organizations, 
        professions, and individuals; and building technology, standards, and 
        infrastructure</font>.</p>
