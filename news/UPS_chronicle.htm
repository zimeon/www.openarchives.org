<H3>'Open Archives' Project Promises Alternative to Costly Journals</H3><P>

In the latest attempt to harness the Internet to improve communication among scholars, a group of researchers is proposing that universities and scholarly societies around the world create electronic repositories of research papers that would be connected through the Net so that they could be used as a single collection. 
<br><br>   Scholars would deposit their papers in the system, called the Open Archives, and retrieve papers written by others -- all for free. Universities and scholarly societies would bear the cost of operating individual repositories that would form the global archive. The system is described in a plan drafted recently by 25 scholars from academe and the government at a meeting in Santa Fe, N.M. 
<br><br>   Proponents say it could be operating within a year, but its prospects may be dimmed by a number of factors, including opposition from journal publishers and the reluctance of some scholars to place their work in the archive. 
<br><br>   Because each repository in the Open Archives would use the same standards for indexing papers, a scholar could search all the repositories with a single command. "The idea is to make all the public archives in all the universities in the world into one global, virtual archive," says Stevan Harnad, a professor of cognitive science at the University of Southampton, in England, and an organizer of the Open Archives project. 
<br><br>   But the central virtue of the project, in the eyes of many of its supporters, is that it could offer an alternative to conventional journals, allowing universities to cancel at least some of their high-priced subscriptions. While observers say they don't expect the project to threaten the most prominent scholarly publications, the smaller and more expensive journals offered by commercial publishers could be affected if the archive idea proved successful. 
<br><br>   Researchers at Old Dominion University already have demonstrated the feasibility of the Open Archives, linking six existing archives that contain 200,000 articles through one interface that allows a user to search all six with a single command, says Kurt J. Maly, a professor who is chairman of the computer-science department at Old Dominion. 
<br><br>   Although technical challenges must be overcome if the system is to be expanded to handle millions of articles efficiently, Mr. Maly says that, "in principle, it can work." 
<br><br>   The National Institutes of Health is planning a vast electronic archive of its own, called PubMed Central, that would archive both papers that had been published in peer-reviewed journals and papers that had not been peer reviewed. David Lipman, director of the N.I.H.'s National Center for Biotechnology Information, says that he does not see the Open Archives as a competitor. "If this Santa Fe initiative gets off the ground, we'd certainly coordinate with them," says Dr. Lipman.
<br><br>   Like PubMed Central, the Open Archives would include both peer-reviewed and unreviewed papers. Therein may lie a major roadblock to both: A journal's publisher, rather than its authors, typically owns the copyright to articles in the journal. Commercial publishers are likely to be reluctant to permit published papers to be deposited in the Open Archives, for fear of undercutting subscriptions to their electronic and print editions.
<br><br>   Elsevier Science, the world's largest commercial publisher of scholarly journals, would not permit the texts of papers from its journals to be placed in the Open Archives, says Arie Jongejan, Elsevier Science's managing director for physical-sciences publishing and a member of the Elsevier Science board. 
<br><br>   Elsevier's contract with authors does allow them to deposit the published versions of papers in electronic archives maintained by their academic departments. But Mr. Jongejan says he believes that provision would not cover putting a paper in a departmental archive that was part of the new open system. An author could, however, contribute a preliminary version of a paper to the open system, Mr. Jongejan says. 
<br><br>   The preliminary version also could contain a link to the final version of the paper in an electronic data base maintained by Elsevier, he says, adding: "Our general philosophy is that we like to see usage of our material increase." But only subscribers to the electronic edition of the journal would be able to follow the link to the final version of the article. 
<br><br>   David Shulenberger, the provost of the University of Kansas and an outspoken advocate of the expanded use of electronic communication in science, says that the Open Archives project will be much less attractive to universities if it does not include peer-reviewed articles. 
<br><br>   "As an unrefereed repository, it gives scientists another tool," Mr. Shulenberger says, but that tool would cost universities more rather than save them money. However, if published articles were included in the Open Archives, "then we could use some of the funds that we spend on enormously expensive subscriptions to pay for computer servers on campus" to house the repositories, he says. "Then they will have made a real contribution." 
<br><br>   That prospect is far off, according to one leader of the project, who predicts that subscription journals and the Open Archives will exist side by side for a period, but that the archive will eventually win out.
<br><br>   "For years to come -- 5 or 10 or more -- we will have to live with both worlds," says Herbert Van de Sompel, a librarian at the University of Ghent, in Belgium. Such a period of double expenditures is the only solution to the problem of the escalating cost of journals, he says. "If we don't do something, we'll be stuck with the same serials crisis until the end of our days." 
<br><br>   For many journals, the Open Archives won't be much of a threat, says Richard K. Johnson, enterprise director of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, a project of the Association of Research Libraries that seeks to develop lower-cost alternatives for scholarly communication. 
<br><br>   "People will still want to subscribe to <I>Nature,</I> people will still want to subscribe to <I>Science,</I> because there is value added through their peer review," says Mr. Johnson. Journals published by for-profit companies probably would be threatened more than journals published by scholarly societies, because the subscription prices for some for-profit journals are excessive, he says. 
<br><br>   "The ones who should worry are the ones that are not delivering value for what they charge," he says.
<br><br>   Donald W. King, co-author of a forthcoming book called <I>Towards Electronic Journals: Realities for Scientists, Librarians and Publishers</I> (Special Libraries Association, 2000), agrees that the archive may not present much of a threat to publishers. "These data bases are going to complement the traditional library subscription," not replace it, he says. 
<br><br>   Scholars already share articles that have been published, he notes. "There's an awful lot of photocopies going from person to person," for which the publishers receive no income, says Mr. King. Distributing journal articles electronically would be little different, he says. 
<br><br>   Even though the Open Archives is being envisioned as free, Mr. King says it should levy a small fee for each journal article that is downloaded from it. The fee would go to the publisher. The Association for Computing Machinery, a scholarly society in computer science, collects such a charge for electronic access to articles in its journals, and that would serve as "a wonderful model" for the global archive, he says. 
<br><br>   Such a fee would encourage university libraries to maintain their subscriptions to popular journals, because those subscriptions would still cost less than the aggregate expense of downloading from the archive many individual articles from those journals, he says. 
<br><br>   However, the University of Southampton's Mr. Harnad opposes such fees, saying they would fundamentally change the nature of the Open Archives. 
<br><br>   Both royalty fees and subscriptions hold "the literature hostage behind a financial firewall instead of freeing it for one and all," he says, adding that publishers should abandon the business of distributing journals -- in print or electronically -- and limit themselves to conducting peer review. 
<br><br>   Publishers could recoup their costs for peer review by charging scholars a small fee when their papers are accepted, akin to the page charges levied by many journals, and authors and universities could afford to pay that fee from their savings from canceled subscriptions, Mr. Harnad says. The result, he says, would be "a refereed, certified literature, firewall-free, for everyone, everywhere, forever." 
<br><br>   Another key question is whether researchers in all disciplines would use the Open Archives. Scholarly disciplines vary widely in their receptiveness to electronic archives, says Rob Kling, a professor of information systems and information science at Indiana University at Bloomington.
<br><br>   He has studied scientists' use of electronic media. "There are important disciplinary differences" that would influence the degree to which scholars in a field would participate in the global archive, says Mr. Kling. 
<br><br>   For example, physics is a relatively small, tightly knit discipline, and physicists are more interested in quickly learning about new discoveries than in waiting through a lengthy peer-review process that assesses the validity of research results. So they enthusiastically use archives, particularly a popular data base of physics papers maintained at Los Alamos National Laboratory, says Mr. Kling. 
<br><br>   By contrast, there are many more molecular biologists than physicists, and consequently many more research papers in the field, so molecular biologists depend on journals' peer review to sift the wheat from the chaff, Mr. Kling says. 
<br><br>   Moreover, fields like physics and computer science can afford to establish electronic archives because they receive extensive financial support, such as grants from the federal government or industry. Other fields, which receive less government money, might have difficulty financing the servers, he says. 
<br><br>   Organizers' optimism that scholars will flock to the archive once it is in place may prove unfounded, says Mr. Kling. "They have a <I>Field of Dreams</I> rhetoric," he says. "Their particular model doesn't fit all fields."
