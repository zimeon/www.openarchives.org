<P><FONT COLOR="#000066">The purpose of this call is the mobilization of
a core group to work towards achieving <B>a universal service for non peer-reviewed

<FONT COLOR="#000066">the adoption of the preprint concept in all areas

<P>In certain areas of scholarly activity, electronic preprint archives
have become an established medium to communicate non peer-reviewed results
of ongoing research. The trend began in high energy phyics in 1991 and
since then, the centralized <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov">xxx</A> preprint
archive has become a global repository for research in physics. xxx has
also incoporated mathematics, non-linear sciences and computer science.
<A HREF="http://www.ncstrl.org/">NCSTRL</A> is a similar initiative, providing
a point of access for technical reports in computer sciences, that are
either submitted to the <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/archive/cs/intro.html">CoRR</A>
part of xxx or to <A HREF="http://www.ncstrl.org/Dienst/UI/2.0/ListPublishers">decentral
departmental archives</A> that cooperate in the initiative. Archives in
the NCSTRL initiative share the <A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/NCSTRL/protocol.html">Dienst</A>
protocol, which enables the creation of library-like services that support
searching and browsing the archive. Along the same lines, the <A HREF="http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/RePEc/">RePEc</A>
initiative in economics provides authors with the option to submit working
papers to the central <A HREF="http://wuecon.wustl.edu/">EconWPA</A> archive
at Washington University or to a <A HREF="http://ideas.uqam.ca/ideas/archives.html">departmental
archive</A>, which supports an agreed upon protocol. This so called <A HREF="http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/RePEc/GuilP.html">Guildford</A>
protocol guarantees interoperability between the RePEc archives and has
enabled the creation of <A HREF="http://ideas.uqam.ca/ideas/services.html">a
variety of end-user services</A>. Recently, <A HREF="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</A>
has expressed a strong interest in the establishment of a preprint initiative
for biology. Slowly, the information industry is beginning to understand
the potential of the preprint concept, regarding it either as an opportunity
for collaborations, as a challenge or as a threat.

<P>All the preprint initiatives share the same goal, which is to optimize
scholarly communication by overcoming the barriers - financial, legal,
... - which the traditional framework has established. Still, some important
barriers remain in place and action is required to promote the preprint
concept beyond its current scope:
<UL>
<LI>
The preprint concept has only been adopted in distinct segments of scholarly
research, and the success of existing initiatives has not yet generated
comparable initiatives in all other areas. Institutionalization of the
preprint approach could be instrumental in broadening the applicable range,
since it allows for a natural extension of the prepublishing habit from
early adopter disciplines to other research areas in multi-disciplinary
institutions. Institutionalization has other benefits:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
the addition of a level of author-authentication to submissions;</LI>

<LI>
sensitivity about the institutional brand which might encourage institutions
to impose a certain level of quality control;</LI>

<LI>
the attribution of the archiving function to the party that should be best
motivated to guarantee the longevity of its output;</LI>

<LI>
the presence of know-how in institutional libraries that could guarantee
a constant formal quality of the output;</LI>

<LI>
the fact that institution based prepublishing can be seen as a straightforward
extension of the ongoing creation of the institutional bibliography.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The existing preprint initiatives have been created from within certain
disciplines. Important issues regarding cross-discipline interoperability
remain to be addressed, in order to come to the creation of global multi-disciplinary
end-user services. Since no segment of scholarly research can stand on
its own, such services are crucial when aiming at the extension of both
the user and the author base of the preprint environment.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
A preprint is the first true public account of a research activity, but
it is only the initial step in a life-cycle. Several versions of the preprint
might be distributed, varying in document format and content. Peer-commentary
or public reviewing can become connected to the preprint. And in many cases,
peer-review will be added as an essential certificate of scientific value,
be it in the form of a seperate peer-review document or a paper published
in an established journal. Later, the preprint and/or paper may become
cited, when it starts influencing other scholars' research. One very important
aspect of the preprint concept is that the prepublished document receives
an identifying number at the start of its life-cycle. Potentially, this
early identification makes possible a framework to track the complete life-cycle
of a published research activity. This is in contrast with traditional
publishing, where identifiers are accorded somewhere further down the line,
out of the reach of the research community and can only be obtained by
"buying" it back again. Since such identifiers are becoming crucial to
interrelate the output of research activities, this is a serious obstacle,
strengthening the existing dependency on commercial services. Unfortunately,
the existing preprint architectures have little support for "life after
the preprint" that could allow for a smooth integration of several manifestations
of a research publication, both free and commercial. The latter is essential
for both scholarly communication as such and in convincing the information
industry about the potential benefits of the preprint concept to their
business.</LI>
</UL>
These considerations - to which you can easily add numerous others - have
urged us to initiate this call. Although we understand the dimensions of
the problem, we propose a pragmatic approach, considering that such a strategy
can sometimes lead to practical and convincing results.

<P>The following are the action lines we are currently considering, and
which are obviously open to discussion:
<UL>
<LI>
Alignment of existing preprint initiatives along a framework that:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
is open to the creation of cross-disciplinary end-user services;</LI>

<LI>
is open to the concept of "life after the preprint";</LI>

<LI>
initially only serves to create a prototype system.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Promotion of the framework via the creation of a prototype demonstrating:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
the universal service notion for interoperable preprint initiatives;</LI>

<LI>
the openness of the framework for the addition of "life after the preprint"
services, both free and commercial;</LI>

<LI>
global dissemination of a multi-authored paper on the initiative (cf the
copyright paper) to academic institutions, library organizations, authors,
readers;</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Submission of a project proposal aimed at the development and the promotion
of a solid framework for a Universal Preprint Service (UPS).</LI>
</UL>
In order to achieve this, we call upon you to contribute to the UPS initiative
in one or more of the following ways:
