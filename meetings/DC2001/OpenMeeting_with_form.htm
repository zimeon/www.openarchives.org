<h2>The Open Archives Initiative</h2>
<p>The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) develops and promotes interoperability standards that aim to facilitate the efficient dissemination of content.  The Open Archives Initiative has its roots in an effort to
enhance access to e-print archives as a means of increasing the availability of scholarly communication.
Continued support of this work remains a cornerstone of the Open Archives program.  The fundamental
technological framework and standards that are developing to support this work are, however, independent of
the both the type of content offered and the economic mechanisms surrounding that content, and promise to
have much broader relevance in opening up access to a range of digital materials.  As
a result, the Open Archives Initiative is currently an organization and an effort explicitly in transition, and is committed to exploring
and enabling this new and broader range of applications.  As we gain greater knowledge
of the scope of applicability of the underlying technology and standards being developed, and begin to understand the structure
and culture of the various adopter communities, we expect that we will have to make continued
evolutionary changes to both the mission and organization of the Open Archives Initiative.</p>
<p>More information on the OAI is available at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org">http://www.openarchives.org</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Purpose of this Meeting</h2>
<p>During the past year, participants in the OAI have been defining and
experimenting with an interoperability architecture based on metadata
harvesting.&nbsp; The goal of this architecture is to provide an easy way for <i>data
providers</i> to expose their metadata and for <i>service providers </i>to
access that metadata and use it as input to value-added services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meeting will mark the public release of the specifications of this
interoperability architecture.&nbsp; The release represents the fixing of these
specifications for a one year period of experimentation. The meeting will include an overview of the
organizational and historical context of the Open Archives Initiative, a
detailed presentation of the OAI interoperability architecture, presentations by
alpha testers who experimented with the protocol, and opportunities for
break-out groups to facilitate building of communities within the OAI technical
framework. A European companion to this meeting will be held in the first
quarter of 2001.&nbsp; Announcements for this meeting will be made when details
are known.</p>
