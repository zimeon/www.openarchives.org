<p class="MsoBodyText">The document describes the semantics of the metadata
elements that will be used for interoperability among Eprint repositories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The stated of goal of these elements is simple resource discovery of
scholarly Eprints, which are almost exclusively textual documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The semantics of the elements is purposely loose with the assumption that
values for the metadata elements will be entered by non-professionals (e.g.,
authors of Eprints).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The transfer
syntax of the metadata elements will be XML, the DTD for which is defined in
another document.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, except
where noted, values for elements are unformatted strings.</p>

the Santa Fe Set exactly matches that of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set,
the definition of the Dublin Core element has been used.<o:p>

Elements that are optional are annotated with a [O].&nbsp; Elements that are
repeatable are annotated with a [R].&nbsp; Note that the fact that an elements
may be repeated implies that multiple values should not be associated with a
single element (e.g.,&nbsp; associating multiple authors with a single Author
tag).<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<h3>Date of Accession<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>[M]</h3>
<p>The date when the document was entered into the repository.&nbsp; It is
assumed that in most cases this date will be created automatically by the
repository software rather than entered by a human user.&nbsp; The date should
be encoded in the format YYYY-MM-DD, which is a subset of the guidelines defined
in ISO 8601.<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><o:p>

</o:p>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">A URL (Universal Resource Location) identifying a human
readable page that provides access to the possible manifestations (e.g.,
PostScript, TeX) of the document.&nbsp; For repositories that have only one
manifestation per document, this URL may point to that single manifestation.<o:p>

Object ID [O] [R]<o:p>
</o:p>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">A unique (within the scope of the repository) identifier of
the document.&nbsp; For some repositories this may be the same as the URL
defined by the Display ID, in which case no Object ID should be supplied.<o:p>

<h3><o:p>
</o:p>
Author [M] [R]</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The author or corporate author who is responsible for

<p class="MsoNormal">A free-text value that contains information outside the

<h3>Date for Discovery [O] [R]</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A date relevant to the document that may aid the user
trying to find the document.&nbsp; A common example of such a date would be an
original publication date of a document that was placed in an repository at a
later time (i.e., its date of accession is later than its date of publication).&nbsp;
The date should be encoded in the format YYYY-MM-DD, which is a subset of the
guidelines defined in ISO 8601.</p>
