<p>Welcome to the Santa Fe Convention. This convention is the result of a meeting 
  of the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org">Open Archives Initiative</a> which 
  was held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on October 21-22 1999. This convention has 
  been endorsed unanimously by <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/ups-participants.htm">all 
  the participants</a> at the meeting, who represented organizations maintaining 
  or planning e-print archives intended for open access and organizations interested 
  in providing services, such as search interfaces or citation-linking, based 
  on the data in those archives. The convention presents a simple technical and 
  organizational framework to support basic interoperability among e-print archives. 
  Participants have expressed the intention of implementing this framework to 
  allow for interoperability experiments in the course of the year 2000. Maintainers 
  of existing or forthcoming e-print archives that were not represented at the 
  meeting are strongly encouraged to join this effort by implementing the framework 
  for their archives.</p>
<h3><font color="#000000" face="Arial">Objective</font></h3>

<p><font color="#000000">Scholarly authors can make electronic 
  documents available to a global audience by submitting them to e-print archives. 
  At the time of writing this convention (January 2000), the number of established 
  e-print archives is small. One is arXiv.org, the Los Alamos e-print archive 
  created by Paul Ginsparg, which has become a crucial hub for communicating research 
  findings in physics. We anticipate the creation of many more e-print archives 
  in the coming years. Such archives will be distributed across the Internet; 
  some will be oriented to particular scholarly disciplines, others based on institutional 
  affiliation. For e-print archives to become an established mechanism for scholarly 
  communication, some level of interoperability among them needs to be supported. 
  This convention is a first step towards such interoperability. As our experience 
  with the matter develops, more issues may be addressed, new conventions may 
  be created and existing ones may be enhanced. The Open Archives Initiative provides 
  a process for growth and development.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The Santa Fe Convention presents a technical 
  and organizational framework designed to facilitate the discovery of content 
  stored in distributed e-print archives. It makes easy-to-implement technical 
  recommendations for archives that – when implemented – will allow data from 
  e-print archives to become widely available via its inclusion in a variety of 
  end-user services such as search engines, recommendation services and systems 
  for interlinking documents. In addition, the convention introduces an organizational 
  framework for making information available about archives that adhere to the 
  technical recommendations of this convention and about trusted parties that 
  build end-user services for data originating from such archives. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We invite you to implement the recommendations 
  made in this convention for your archive to contribute to the creation of a 
  more effective scholarly communication mechanism. </font></p>
