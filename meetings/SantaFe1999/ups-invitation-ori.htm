<h4><a name="abs"></a>Abstract</h4>

<p><font color="#000066">The purpose of this call is the mobilization of a core 

  group to work towards achieving <b>a universal service for author self-archived 

  scholarly literature</b>. Such a universal service is thought of being the fundamental 

  and free layer of scholarly information, above which both free and commercial 

  services could flourish. We think that important steps towards the establishment 

  of such a universal service can be taken by identifying or creating interoperable 

  technologies and frameworks for the dissemination of author self-archived documents 

  (termed e-prints). </font></p>

<p><font color="#000066">A meeting of technical experts to be held in Santa Fe, 
  New Mexico, on October 21-22 1999 is proposed to discuss various issues regarding 
  interoperability. A visible outcome of this meeting should be an agreement regarding 
  an approach to build a promotional prototype multidisciplinary digital library 
  service for the main existing e-print archives. Furthermore, it is hoped that 
  this initiative can lead to the creation of a forum that will continue to address 
  the interoperability of self-archiving solutions, as a means to promote their 
  global adoption.</font></p>

<h4><a name="back"></a>Background</h4>

<p>In certain areas of scholarly activity, electronic preprint archives have become 
  an established medium to communicate non peer-reviewed results of ongoing research. 
  The trend began in high energy physics in 1991 and since then, the centralized 
  <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov">xxx</a> preprint archive has become a global repository 
  for research in physics. xxx has also incorporated mathematics, non-linear sciences 
  and computer science. <a href="http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk">CogPrints</a> is 
  modeled on xxx and focuses mainly on papers in Psychology, Linguistics and Neuroscience. 
  <a href="http://www.ncstrl.org/">NCSTRL</a> is a similar initiative, providing 
  a point of access for technical reports in computer sciences, that are either 
  submitted to the <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/archive/cs/intro.html">CoRR</a> 
  part of xxx or to <a href="http://www.ncstrl.org/Dienst/UI/2.0/ListPublishers">decentral 
  departmental archives</a> that cooperate in the initiative. Archives in the 
  NCSTRL initiative share the <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/NCSTRL/protocol.html">Dienst</a> 
  protocol, which enables the creation of library-like services that support searching 
  and browsing the archive. Along the same lines, the <a href="http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/RePEc/">RePEc</a> 
  initiative in economics provides authors with the option to submit working papers 
  to a <a href="http://ideas.uqam.ca/ideas/archives.html">departmental archive</a> 
  or - if one does not exist - to the <a href="http://wuecon.wustl.edu/">EconWPA</a> 
  archive at Washington University. These archives support the so called <a href="http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/RePEc/GuilP.html">Guildford</a> 
  protocol that guarantees interoperability between the RePEc archives and has 
  enabled the creation of <a href="http://ideas.uqam.ca/ideas/services.html">a 
  variety of end-user services</a>. The <a href="http://www.ndltd.org/">NDLTD 
  project</a> aims at building a digital library of electronic theses and dissertations 
  (ETD) authored by students of member institutions. NDLTD addresses issues such 
  as the creation of a workflow to submit ETDs, the development of an XML DTD 
  for ETDs and the support of a digital library for ETDs. </p>

<p>There are several indications that a growing number of efforts are investigating 

  the establishment of communication mechanisms that find inspiration in the pioneering 

  work mentioned above. Recently, <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a> has expressed 

  a strong interest in the establishment of the centralized <a href="http://www.nih.gov/welcome/director/ebiomed/ebi.htm">E-biomed</a> 

  initiative for biomedical sciences. The Stanford libraries and the BMJ just 

  announced details on their <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/318/7199/1637">e-print 

  server</a>. CalTech's <a href="http://library.caltech.edu/publications/scholarsforum/">Scholar 

  Forum</a> proposes an alternative model for scholarly communication. <a href="http://www.arl.org/SPARC/">SPARC</a> 

  initiated the <a href="http://www.arl.org/SPARC/sci.html">SCI</a> call, asking 

  for proposals introducing alternative communication channels as a way to address 

  the serials crisis. Also the information industry is starting to understand 

  the potential of the e-print concept, regarding it either as an opportunity 

  for collaborations, as a challenge or as a threat. </p>

<p>The aim of the initiatives mentioned above is to optimize scholarly communication. 

  The approaches that are taken or suggested are quite different. Some initiatives 

  build on an centralized model, others on a distributed departmental, or by extension, 

  institutional model. Some deal with grey literature only, others incorporate 

  metadata of peer-reviewed papers or try and establish some form of peer-review 

  outside of the established system. Some only deal with metadata, others with 

  both metadata and manuscripts. We think that the joint impact of these and future 

  initiatives can be substantially higher when interoperability between them can 

  be established. The aim of our initiative is to create a forum to address various 

  issues regarding interoperability, as a way to break the ground for a more universal 

  adoption of author self-archived communication mechanisms. In this context, 

  interoperability is a broad term, touching many diverse aspects of author self-archived 

  systems, including their metadata formats, their underlying architecture, their 

  openness to the creation of digital library services, their integration with 

  other information layers, their usability in a multidisciplinary context, the 

  metrics for usage of e-prints and for evaluation of their scholarly impact, 

  ...</p>

<p>As a preparation for the October meeting, concrete work is already going on. 

  <a href="http://www.clir.org/pubs/pain/pain06.html#repositioning">Herbert 

  Van de Sompel</a> (Los Alamos National Laboratory & University of Ghent) has 

  initiated the protoproto project that simulates some aspects of interoperable 

  distributed e-print archives. Under the umbrella of the so-called <a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/plan/ghent_1.html">Ghent-agreement</a>, 

  <a href="http://gretel.econ.surrey.ac.uk">Thomas Krichel</a> (University of 

  Surrey & RePEc) has joined the initiative and is currently converting data from 

  existing e-print initiatives into the <a href="http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/RePEc/ReDIF.html">ReDIF</a> 

  metadata format that is being used in the RePEc initiative. <a href="http://home.larc.nasa.gov/%7Emln/">Michael 

  Nelson</a> (NASA Langley) also joined and will take this data and use it to 

  create various archives architected along the lines of his Smart Object Dumb 

  Archives concepts. The aim of this protoproto work is not to make statements 

  about the architectural directions that UPS should take, but rather to facilitate 

  discussions about this at the October meeting. Thus far, permission has been 

  obtained to use data from CogPrints, NASA, NCSTRL, RePEc and xxx, while a decision 

  regarding data from NDLTD is being awaited. </p>
