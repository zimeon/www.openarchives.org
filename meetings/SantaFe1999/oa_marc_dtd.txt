<!-- Open Archives MARC Transport Definition -->
<!-- This DTD can be used to encode MARC records for transport within the -->
<!-- Open Archives community. -->
<!-- Draft version 0.1, Robert France, 19 January 2000 -->

<!-- For the MARC standard, see "http://www.loc.gov/marc/". -->

<!-- Questions: -->
<!--   1)  What entity sets should we use? US-MARC generally uses an  -->
<!--     extended (8-bit) ASCII standard called ANSEL, although it is -->
<!--     defined to also allow UNICODE transcription.  I'm not aware -->
<!--     of any standard entity set that covers the ANSEL characters. -->
<!--   2)  MARC field IDs are always 3-digit decimal integers; subfield -->
<!--     labels for variable fields are always single letters.  Is it -->
<!--     worthwhile defining entities for these?  -->
<!--   3)  Instead of !DOCTYPE, Mark Doyle uses this construct: -->
<!--        <!ENTITY % doctype "oa_marc"> -->
<!--        <!ELEMENT %doctype; (fixfield+, varfield*)> -->
<!--     Why does he do this, and which way is better here? -->

<!-- "Fixed fields" are fixed-length character strings, each position (range) -->
<!--     of which has different meaning.  Blanks are used within these fields -->
<!--     to indicate missing or unknown values, and two blanks are thus very -->
<!--     different from one blank.  Accordingly, the (#PCDATA) in fixfield -->
<!--     elements must always be quoted.  How do we say that in XML? -->
<!--     Since fixed field values are always ASCII not ANSEL, and thus contain -->
<!--     neither tags nor entities, would it work simply to use (CDATA) instead? -->
