<h3>Introductory concepts</h3>
</font><FONT FACE="Arial"> <a name="openarchives"></a> 
<h4>Archives and open e-print archives</h4>
</FONT><I> 
<P></P>
</I> 
<P>We consider the following to be crucial components of an e-print 
  archive:</P>
<ul>
  <li>A submission mechanism;</li>
  <li>A long-term storage system.</li>
  <p></P>
</ul>
<P></P>
<P>In addition, we consider it crucial that an e-print archive 
  be open, incorporating a mechanism that enables third parties to collect data 
  from the archive. Such a mechanism allows third parties to create end-user services 
  that support the discovery, presentation and analysis of data in the archive. 
  We recognize that most e-print archives will also provide end-user services. 
  However, we consider that facilitating the broad dissemination of archive data 
  through third party services is a crucial feature of an e-print archive.</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> <a name="managedarchives"></a>
<h4>Managed e-print archives</h4>
</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>We also assume that e-print archives are managed. This means 
  that they have some form of policy with regard to the submission of documents 
  and also a policy with regard to the preservation and retention of documents. 
</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> <a name="providerimplementer"></a>
<h4>Data providers and service providers</h4>
</FONT> 
<P>Consistent with the objective of the Santa Fe Convention and 
  the identification of the crucial functions of an e-print archive, we make a 
  distinction between data providers and service providers.</P>
<ul>
  <li> A <i>data provider</i> is the manager of an e-print archive, acting on 
    behalf of the authors submitting documents to the archive. As pointed out 
    above, the data provider of an open archive will, at least, provide a submission 
    mechanism, a long-term storage system and a mechanism that enables third parties 
    to collect data from the archive. </li>
  <li>A <i>service provider</i> is a third party, creating end-user services based 
    on data stored in e-print archives. For instance, a service provider could 
    implement a search engine for mathematical e-prints stored in archives worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> <a name="archivedata"></a>
<h4>Data in an e-print archive</h4>
</FONT><B> </B> 
<P>An archive may store metadata that describes full content without 
  storing the full content itself. In this case, we consider the metadata as a 
  record. However, we assume that if full content is stored, there will always 
  be associated metadata stored in the archive as well as a mechanism to tie metadata 
  and content together. In this case we consider the combination of metadata and 
  full content as a <i>record</i>.</P>
<P>In this convention, therefore, we define an archive as a collection 
  of records. These records have the following properties: </P>
<ul>
  <li>A record in an e-print archive contains, at least, metadata that describes 
    full content; </li>
  <li>A record in an e-print archive may also contain full content such as a research 
    paper, a dataset, software, etc. or a bundle of these. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="provider"></a></h3>
<h3>For the data provider: how to make your e-print archive comply 
  with the Santa Fe Convention?</h3>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"></font></i></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> <a name="provider1"></a>
<h4>Step 1: Choose a unique identifier for your e-print archive</h4>
</FONT> 
<P>To support interoperability, each archive should have a <i>unique 
  archive identifier</i>. This identifier refers to the authority managing the 
  archive or to the archive initiative. Choose an identifier that consists of 
  alphanumerical characters [a-z, A-Z, 0-9]. To make sure that your archive identifier 
  does not coincide with that of another archive, check the list of existing identifiers 
  at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_archives.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_archives.htm</a>. 
  Formally, the case of characters in the archive identifier is significant; however 
  identifiers should be selected to be distinct regardless of case.</P>
<UL>
  <FONT SIZE=2> </font><I> 
  <P>
  <LI>When setting up an open archive for the University of Spa in Belgium, one 
    could choose BESPA as the archive identifier. </LI>
  <p></P>
  <P>
  <LI> The existing NCSTRL initiative could choose NCSTRL, while the RePEc initiative 
    could opt for RePEc. </LI>
  </i>
</UL>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> <a name="provider2"></a>
<h4>Step 2: Use unique persistent identifiers for records in the archive</h4>
</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>Records in your archive should have unique persistent identifiers. 
  It is up to you to make sound decisions on their structure and generation. </P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>When you combine a <i>unique archive identifier</i> and a <i>unique 
  record identifier</i> for a record in your archive, the result is a <i>full 
  identifier</i> for a record in your archive, that will never coincide with a 
  full identifier of a record in another archive. This makes the job of service 
  providers a lot easier. Choose a printable, non-alphanumeric character as a 
  <i>separator</i> to delimit the archive identifier from the record identifier.</P>
<P></P>

<UL>
  <I> 
  <P> 
  <LI>The archive of the University of Spa will accord meaningful identifiers 
    to metadata submitted to the archive. Let us assume that those identifiers 
    consist of the faculty of the first author followed by a sequence number that 
    contains date information. Hence, a record identifier might be MEDICINE/19991104/012. 
    If this archive chooses a hyphen to delimit the archive identifier from the 
    record identifier, the full identifier for the record would be: BESPA-MEDICINE/19991104/012.</LI>
  <p></P>
  </I> 
  <P> 
  <LI><i>arXiv.org uses record identifiers that start with the name of a sub-archive 
    followed by a date-sensitive sequence number. For instance, physics/9811004 
    and hep-th/9909044 are valid identifiers in this archive. In this case, using 
    a colon as delimiter, the full identifiers would become arXiv:physics/9811004 
    and arXiv:hep-th/9909044.</i></LI>
</UL>
<p>The identifier of a record in your archive - either the full identifier or 
  the record identifier (without its leading archive identifier) - will be the 
  crucial key for extracting the metadata for a record. In some archives, it may 
  also be the key to get to the full content of the record. In other archives, 
  other metadata elements within a record will point to the full content. <FONT FACE="Arial"> 
  </FONT></p>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> <a name="provider3"></a>
<h4>Step 3: Implement the Open Archives Metadata Set</h4>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P>We recognize that archives will use specific metadata sets and formats that 
  suit the needs of their communities and the types of data they handle. However, 
  interoperability depends on a shared format for exchanging metadata and therefore 
  archives should implement the basic Open Archives Metadata Set (oams) which 
  is described at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_oams.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_oams.htm</a>.</P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> <a name="provider4"></a>
<h4>Step 4: Implement and document other metadata formats supported by your e-print 
  archive </h4>
</FONT> 
<P></P>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Service providers will be able to provide more powerful services 
  for users if a metadata format that is richer than the basic oams can be harvested 
  from your archive. We encourage data providers to provide access to the full 
  richness of metadata available to support discovery and retrieval of records 
  in their archive, preferably by adopting an exchange format already used by 
  other e-print archives. To help you determine whether an existing format can 
  serve your needs, we maintain a list of such metadata formats at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_metadata.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_metadata.htm</a>.<font size="+1" color="#009900"></font></p>



<P></P>
<P>If no existing format suits your needs, you must take on the 
  tough task of compiling your own format. For compliance with the harvesting 
  interface presented in Step 5, you will also have to define an XML representation 
  for it. It is important that you document your metadata format fully and make 
  the documentation available to service providers. Again, it will make their 
  jobs a lot easier. If you inform the Open Archives initiative about the alternative 
  metadata format for your archive, we will include it on the OA list of metadata 
  formats at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_metadata.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_metadata.htm</a>, 
  so that others can benefit from your work.</P>
<P></P>

<UL>
  <I>
  <P>
  <LI>The formats that are in use or under implementation by the archives contributing 
    to the compilation of this convention are - at the time of writing - the following: 
    MARC, ReDIF, Dublin Core, REFER, RFC 1807, Open Archives Metadata Set.</LI>
  </i>
</UL>

<FONT FACE="Arial"> <a name="provider5"></a>
<h4>Step 5: Implement the Dienst harvesting interface</h4>
</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>Once your archive has identifiers and supports one or more 
  metadata formats, the next step turns it into an open archive, by making sure 
  that service providers can access data from your archive. Because we anticipate 
  the creation of many open archives and because we want services across those 
  archives to be built in a short to medium time period, we strongly recommend 
  that all archives implement the same harvesting interface. Such a harvesting 
  interface must allow third parties to write software that collects data selectively 
  from the open archives. We propose a harvesting interface that complies with 
  the Open Archives Subset of the Dienst Protocol, which is described in detail 
  at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_dienst.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_dienst.htm</a>. 
  To support a better understanding of the recommendations in this convention, 
  we provide a brief description of the protocol subset here.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Dienst protocol has an HTTP-based implementation. Its Open 
  Archives subset defines a communication procedure, as well as the syntax for 
  the corresponding messages and responses, that will allow service providers 
  to harvest metadata selectively from open archives that comply with the Santa 
  Fe Convention. The procedure has three steps:</P>
<ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
  <li><b>Action 1: an archive can be polled to obtain the following information 
    about the archive:</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>The logical partitions into which records are grouped within the archive;</li>
      <li>The metadata formats that are supported for delivery of archive metadata 
        in response to a harvesting request.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <p></p>
</ul>
<dir> 
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The Open Archives Subset of the Dienst protocol defines how 
    such polling requests should be sent and the syntax used by an archive to 
    respond to such requests. It does not define the set of valid responses to 
    the metadata format request. But in the Open Archives context, the list of 
    valid formats and their identifiers is available at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_metadata.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_metadata.htm</a>.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Archives should support several criteria to divide their 
    content into logical partitions that are recognized by the Open Archives Dienst 
    Subset. We especially recommend subject-oriented partitioning as well as partitioning 
    based on author affiliation.</p>
</dir>
<ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
  <li><b>Action 2: a list of identifiers for records in an archive can be requested.</b> 
    <p>We expect these identifiers to be the unique persistent identifiers of 
      the records in the archives. The Open Archives Dienst Subset defines the 
      syntax to request:</p>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
  <ul>
    <li>A list of identifiers for all records in the archive;</li>
    <li>A list of identifiers for the records in a partition of the archive;</li>
    <li>A list of identifiers for records that have become available in the archive 
      after a specified date;</li>
    <li>A list of identifiers for records that have become available in an archive 
      partition after a specified date.</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
</ul>
<dir> 
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The Open Archives Dienst Subset also defines the way in which 
    the list of identifiers will be returned.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
</dir>
<ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
  <li><b>Action 3: given a list of identifiers (obtained by Action 2) and a supported 
    metadata format (identified through Action 1), a request to harvest metadata 
    can be sent.</b> 
    <p> The Open Archives Dienst Subset defines the syntax for the harvesting 
      request. In the subset, exchange of metadata is always in XML, whichever 
      metadata set is chosen. A list of formats and details on their interpretation 
      and XML representation is available at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_metadata.htm">http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_metadata.htm</a>. 
      An archive should respond to a request for metadata in a specified format 
      by returning data rendered according to the corresponding exchange format. 
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 6: Let the Open Archives initiative know that your e-print archive is 
  open </h4>
</FONT> 
<P>The last step is to join the community of open e-print archives 
  by informing the Open Archives initiative of the details for your open archive.
