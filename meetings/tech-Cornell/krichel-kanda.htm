<h2>1: Introduction</h2>
<p>At the Ithaca meeting of the technical committee of the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org">Open
Archives Initiative</a> on 7 and 8 September
2000, it was decided that the initiative should sponsor a metadata
format to be used be the eprint community.  This document details
requirements for such a metadata format, and proposes some fundamental
design choices.  It is not an official statement of the Open Archive
Initiative. It has benefited from comments by Ivan V. Kurmanov.
<p><a name="l2"></a>
<h2>2: Requirements analysis</h2>
<p>The metadata format we consider here is sponsored by the Open Archives
Initiative (OAI). More specifically the interested parties are those
who attended the Santa Fe meeting in October 1999. This initial
constituency comprises important initiatives in the author
self-archiving movement. This movement comprises initiatives who aim to
build an infrastructure for non-tollgated access to research documents
on the Internet. This infrastructure is meant to be a basic free layer
of primary research documents.  It may provide the foundation for
other fee-based services that build secondary documents out of those
primary research documents.
<p>Formal archives like <a href="http://www.arXiv.org">arXiv.org</a> or
formal archive collection like <a href="http://www.repec.org">RePEc</a> have
had two problems
<ol>
<li >Some have seen a small number of contributing authors.
<li >Some have have collected metadata that is poor and
  inconsistent.
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, there is a flourishing culture of informal 
archiving in many disciplines. This is either done through
web sites managed by research groups or through personal
homepages of researchers.  While informal archiving is
is welcome as a first step, there are
important problems
<ol>
<li >Access to the papers in essentially limited to insiders who
  know about the informal archive. 
<li >There is no persistence in the provision of access.
</ol>
<p>There are two approaches that can be taken to strengthen the infrastructure
of the free layer. 
<p>The first approach is to convince more authors to submit to formal
archives. This will only be successful, if the benefits of submission
of a paper outweighs the cost of submission.  The key element to
maximizing the benefits of submission is to raise the visibility of the
submitted documents.  This can be achieved by the submitted documents
appearing in many high quality user services. The Open Archive
Initiative insures the inclusion in many users services. However the
quality of the services will crucially depend on the quality of the
metadata that is supplied to them. As soon as user service does more
that full-text indexing, it will need a large stock of high quality
metadata.
<p>The second approach it to help the homepage publications movement to
provide a better dissemination infrastructure. This can be done
through strengthening the metadata provision through such pages with
simple, author-supplied metadata. These data can then be fed into the
Open Archives system using an intermediate provider. For this or a
similar approach to work, there must be a basic level of metadata that
is simple and intuitive for a non-specialist.
<p>Both approach transit via setting up metadata collections
that are 
<dl>
<li > large
<li > simple to compose
<li > high-quality
</dl>
<p>Of these three requirements, "large", and "simple to compose" are
quite easy to understand. The requirement for high-quality metadata is
more elusive. It certainly implies that there should be an important
level of sub-tagging of information.  For example, the format should
allow for different author names to be unambiguously separated and
there should be ways to associate institutional affiliations with each
author.  Metadata may include citation information or classification
data.  All these requirements contrast with the requirement of
simplicity.
<p>The requirement to collect large collections for comprehensive
metadata suggest that the format should be able to address any kind of
research report, be it in the past or at present. Thus the format
should not be dependent on the physical support, and it should not
only be populated with data on freely available documents.  It appears
unlikely that the format will attract a lot of document descriptions
without the collaboration of the established scientific, technical and
medical (STM) publishers. It will therefore be crucial to accommodate
the wishes of that clientele. The metadata format must meet their
dissemination requirements.
<p>The requirement of simplicity to compose calls for an intuitive
vocabulary of field names that can be applied to most scientific
documents. These include the natural fields like author names, title,
and the URL of the full text. The metadata field names
should be so intuitive that a non-specialist can provide
them quite easily.
<p>The requirement of high quality suggests that the metadata format
should allow to make additional statements about the primary
records. This will allow third parties to refine the data that is
found in the primary document data.  This is best seen through an
example. Imagine that there is an author who has published technical
document is various archives maintained by various archives that, for
example, are managed by university libraries. There should be some
mechanism of a person to say that she has been an author of these
documents and that where her current homepage is. This will allow user
services to directly link to a authors homepage where the user may
find important, recent information about the author. For another
example, if there are sets of non-peer reviewed papers available,
there should be a possibility for a publisher to state that they hold
peer-reviewed versions of these papers. Note that both the author and
the publisher may use intermediate digital libraries to accomplish
the provision of the additional information.

<h2>3: A conceptual framework to fulfill the requirements</h2>
<p>There may be people who believe that there is a single but extensible
metadata format, that can be used to represent all aspects of reality
up to any level of depth with by providers with minimal
expertise. This document is based the idea that such a format is not
possible. It sets out requirements for a specific metadata set within
a precise conceptual framework.
<p>We believe that a fairly complete description of the
scholarly communication process can be produced within
a conceptual framework that is limited to four entities
<p><ol>
<li > documents 
<li > groups 
<li > people
<li > institutions
</ol>
<p>Accordingly, we propose four fundamental types of records that the
format that the metadata format will describe. 
<p>The requirement that the metadata is simple to compose calls for a
single record type for document description to be used
throughout. That is, each research document, be it a PhD thesis, a
conference paper, a refereed research article should be described
through that type.  This single type will allow a non-specialist to
describe a document in isolation, i.e.  without any knowledge of any of
the rest of the metadata. Non-specialists will only have to worry
about the metadata vocabulary in that simple set.
<p>In order to fulfill the requirement of comprehensiveness and
high-metadata quality, the document type will be supplemented by the
three other types. 
<p>The group type will describe collections of documents. The group type
will allow to refine the nature of the document.  This is of critical
importance, of example, to describe the peer reviewing process that
documents undergo. For example, if the document was presented at a
conference, there may an indication that the document belongs to a
group of documents that have been presented at that conference. The
conference itself is an ephemeral and thus not worthy of further
description. Groups may be nested.
<p>The third fundamental type that the format will cover are physical
persons. It is useful to be able to separate personal data out of the
data on in-prints. This will allow a better representation of author
data, with is one of the crucial component of research document
metadata. Much of the practical difficulties of constructing a simple
metadata format for documents comes from the attempt to overload the
in-print information with author metadata. A better information
infrastructure of personal data will also allow innovative personal
logging facilities for the providers of documents.
<p>Finally, the last fundamental type will be the institutions who
support the creation and distribution of scholarly data. These include
commercial publishers, academic institutions and scholarly
societies. These are the most important actors that we need to get
involved in the creation of the dataset. The digital library services
need to talk directly to the providers of the data to illustrate that
an organized digital library outperforms a collection of pages on a
web server.

<h2>4: Relations</h2>
<p>Richness of description will not be achieved by making enriching the
individual types, but rather by set of relations that can exist
between them. In that sense we aim to create a "relational" metadata
set. The value of the argument must be the identifier
of another valid OAI record.
<p><br><strong>Document to document relations</strong> are particularly tricky, because they
include the difficult notion of the formal publication of the document
and the way that should be represented.  We suggest to allow the
following.
<p>"is developed from"<br>
"is a development of"
<p>to allow to relate a document to predecessors and successors,
respectively
<p>"cites"<br>
"is cited by"
<p>to allow for citation data.
<p>"is part of"
<p>if the document is part of another, say for example
it is a chapter in a book.
<p>"is related to"
<p>a placeholder for other relations.
<p><br><strong>Document to group</strong> relations are, for example
<p>"is member of"
<p>The document is a member of the group.
<p>"includes"
<p>The document includes all member or the group. For example the
conference proceedings, as a document, will include all papers
presented at the conference906898 280393.
<p><br><strong>Group to document</strong> relations are
<p>"includes"
<p>The group includes the document. This relation is the primary
means for a group to include members. 
<p>"cites"
<p>All members in the group cite this document. This relation can be used
to represent citation data using the group concept. Note that this is
the primary means by which citation data will be included in the
data, because it is unlikely that individual documents providers will
gather citation data. 
<p><br><strong>Person or institution to group</strong> relations may include
some of the following. 
<p>"composes" 
<p>The person or institution is responsible for the accession of 
documents to the group. 
<p>"referees" 
<p>The person or institution referees the documents in the group. This
applies to editors of peer reviewed journals, where the journal is
modeled as a group.
<p>"provides"
<p>The person or institution is responsible for the provision of the
documents in the group. This is for example the case of a preprint
archive, say arXiv.org, or an individual researcher who provides
papers in a homepage and has defined all his papers as a group.
<p>"publishes"
<p>The person or institution provides the documents and holds the
copyright for all members in the group.
<p>"describes"
<p>The person or institution has issued further data about members of the
group. That is for example the relationship of RePEc (as an
institution) to the documents in RePEc.
<p>There are other relationships, but we think that the
list that we have given here furnishes a reasonable
idea about how the scheme works. 
<p><a name="l5"></a>
<h2>5: Conclusion</h2> 
<p>We have illustrated here a simple conceptual framework that is useful
to describe the scholarly communication process as a whole. The focus
on the process calls of metadata that describes resources (i.e. digital
data and things that can be digitized) and non-resources (i.e. things
that can not be digitized).  Our framework allows for a simple
representation of primary resources--essentially scholarly
document--while at the some time allowing a complex array of
descriptions through the use of non-resources.  This framework
contrasts with other metadata formats that are essentially
resource-focussed and require a sophisticated description of resources
because there is no other place to put descriptions into.
<p>Another way in which proposed framework differs from conventional
bibliographic data formats is that there in no one-to-one
correspondence between and the bibliographic record and the description
of the resource. Several bibliographic records can describe one single
document.
<p>Our framework is not new, it is already realized in the ReDIF version
1. However, ReDIF 1 suffers from a number of design flaws that this
framework is supposed to address. This framework is also more general
and allows for a wider range of applications than ReDIF 1 does.
<p>Clearly, assembling sophisticated collection of such data in the public
domain will be a massive undertaking that will take many years to
accomplish. However, the framework that we propose will allow many
agents to become involved in the metadata provision. The total cost of
provision can be shared among many agents.
