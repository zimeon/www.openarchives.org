Open Archives Initiative Announces Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE)</font></span></b></p>
<p>Ithaca, NY and Los Alamos, NM - The <a href="http://www.opennarchives.org">
Open Archives Initiative</a> (OAI), with the generous support of the
<a href="http://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, announces a new 
effort as part of its mission to<i> develop and promote interoperability 
standards that aim to facilitate the efficient dissemination of content</i>. 
Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) will develop specifications that allow 
distributed repositories to exchange information about their constituent digital 
objects. These specifications will include approaches for representing digital 
objects and repository services that facilitate access and ingest of these 
representations. The specifications will enable a new generation of 
cross-repository services that leverage the intrinsic value of digital objects 
beyond the borders of hosting repositories.</p>
<p>The goals of ORE are inspired by advances in scholarly communication and the 
growth of scholarly material that is available in scholarly repositories 
including institutional repositories, discipline-oriented repositories, dataset 
warehouses, and online journal repositories. This growth is significant by 
itself. However, its real importance lies in the potential for these distributed 
repositories and their contained objects to act as the foundation of a new 
digitally-based scholarly communication framework. Such a framework would permit 
fluid reuse, refactoring, and aggregation of scholarly digital objects and their 
constituent parts - including text, images, data, and software. This framework 
would include new forms of citation, allow the creation of virtual collections 
of objects regardless of their location, and facilitate new workflows that add 
value to scholarly objects by distributed registration, certification, peer 
review, and preservation services. Although scholarly communication is the 
motivating application, we imagine that the specifications developed by ORE may 
extend to other domains.</p>
<p>ORE is funded by Mellon for two years beginning October 2006. It is 
coordinated by <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/lagoze/">Carl Lagoze</a> of
<a href="http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/">Cornell University Information Science</a> 
and <a href="http://public.lanl.gov/herbertv/">Herbert Van de Sompel</a> of the
<a href="http://library.lanl.gov/">Los Alamos Research Library</a>.&nbsp; The 
ORE two-year work plan includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Formation of an international advisory committee, consisting of leaders 
	in e-Science, institutional repositories, publishing, library, and 
	educational technology communities.</li>
	<li>Formation of an international working group that will meet over the two 
	year period and develop the set of ORE specifications.</li>
	<li>Establishment and management of an experimental deployment community 
	that will exercise the developed standards in a variety of contexts.</li>
	<li>Establishment of a
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">sustainable 
	community to support the widespread deployment and management of the 
	standards fabric.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">OAI-ORE will co-exist within the 
Open Archives Initiative with the
<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">Protocol for 
Metadata Harvesting</a> (OAI-PMH), the widely deployed standard for exchange of 
metadata.&nbsp; We expect that the naturally more expressive digital object 
focus of OAI-ORE will complement the&nbsp; narrower metadata focus of OAI-PMH.&nbsp; 
OAI-ORE will benefit from the interoperability experience and depth of the 
international OAI 
community. </span></p>
