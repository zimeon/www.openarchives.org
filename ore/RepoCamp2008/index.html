<p>The ORE Challenge at RepoCamp 2008 received five compelling entries
showcasing the value and potential of <a

can be only one winner and that is <a
href="#OREsome">OREsome</a>. Creator Ross McFarlane will receive a
cash prize from Microsoft Research. All of the entries are described
below along with links to the screen casts:</p>

<p>The ORE Challenge competition was based around the <a

specifications</a>. The specifications are currently being revised
based on community feedback and the release of v1.0 is scheduled for
October 2008.</p>

<p>We are grateful to David Flanders and other organizers of <a

2008 at the Library of Congress, see <a
href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september08/morris/09morris.html">D-Lib
report</a>) for coordinating the challenge; to Savas Parastatidis,
David Flanders, Rob Sanderson and Tim DiLauro for judging the
challenge; and to Microsoft Research for sponsorship.  The entry
guidelines were:</p>

<blockquote style="background-color: #CCC">
<p>There will be a cash prize of $2000, sponsored by Microsoft Research,
for the the best prototype that uses and promotes OAI-ORE. Entries
will be considered and judged with the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The prototype must leverage the value of OAI-ORE.</li>
<li>The prototype must surface OAI-ORE powered functionality at the
end-user level (e.g. in a browser). OAI-ORE should not only be hidden
plumbing.</li>
<li>The more potential the prototype has to promote ORE within and beyond
the repository community the better!</li>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>ORESome solves the problem of understanding and navigating the
structure of highly nested ORE aggregations, such as the
journal/issue/article/page hierarchy, in a very interactive and visual
manner. It was developed in Java, using the <a
href="http://processing.org/">proce55ing toolkit</a>, plus the <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/foresite-toolkit/">foresite java
library</a> for ORE parsing.</p>

</ul>
 
<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>SWORD and OAI-ORE together provide support for the development of
standard utilities and workflows for depositing content to
repositories or service points. This demonstration shows how an
OAI-ORE resource map can be used to support the preservation of the
structural metadata of a complex/compound object within a repository
and how that same OAI-ORE resource map can provide the means for a
delivery application to provide access to a complex object in a
sensible form direct from the repository. The specific use case in our
demonstration shows a SWORD-based deposit of an Open Journal Systems
(OJS) journal issue to a DSpace repository via an OJS SWORD Plugin and
subsequent access by an end-user. As part of the deposit process, an
OAI-ORE resource map representing the aggregation of the issue
articles is created and stored as a repository item. The OAI-ORE
resource map stored alongside the issue articles is then used by
DSpace Manakin to render the journal issue to an end-user.</p>

</ul>
 
<h3>Summary</h3>
 
<p>This plugin allows users to migrate other content that is described by
an ORE resource map into the Omeka exhibition software.  Omeka as a
platform allows much more flexibility for display as opposed to
traditional preservation-based repository software.  For example, if
Flickr were to describe their collections with ORE, users could ingest
their favorite photo sets/pools/tag groups into Omeka and design an
entire interactive experience around those photos, rather than be
restricted to the utilitarian Flickr interface.  As with ORE itself,
content types are not limited to photos; for this screencast I
ingested a blog.  The plugin (as with all Omeka plugins) is written in
PHP.  Parsing of the resource map was accomplished with PHP's
SimpleXML object.  (Sorry for the minute of dead air.  Crawling a
website takes a while.)

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>LORE (Literature Object Re-use and Exchange) is a light-weight
prototype which is designed to allow scholars and teachers of
Australian literature to author, edit and publish compound information
objects encapsulating related digital resources and bibliographic
records via an in-browser visual interface. LORE enables users to
easily create OAI-ORE-compliant compound objects, and also enables
them to describe and publish them to an RDF repository as Named
Graphs. Using LORE, literary scholars can create typed relationships
between individual atomic objects using terms from a bibliographic
ontology and can attach metadata to the compound object.</p>
 
<p>Within the discipline of literature research and teaching, the
ability to relate disparate digital resources in a standardized,
machine-readable format has the potential to add significant value to
distributed collections of literary resources. Such compound objects
can be used to: track the lineage of derivative works which are based
on a common concept or idea; or to relate disparate objects that are
related to a common theme; or to encapsulate related digital resources
for teaching purposes. For example, one might want to relate the
original edition of 'Follow the Rabbit Proof Fence' to the illustrated
edition, a study guide or a digital version of the film based on the
novel.</p>

<p>LORE is implemented as a Mozilla Firefox extension using AJAX
(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and XUL. The current version of LORE
uses a Sesame 2 RDF data store running as a Tomcat Java Servlet for
storing and querying the Named Graphs representing the compound
objects, however we are also working on support for Fedora.</p>
 
<p>We made use of the following open source libraries in developing LORE:
<a href="http://www.jibbering.com/rdf-parser/">RDF Parser</a>, 
<a href="http://www.draw2d.org/">Open Jacob draw 2d</a>, and
<a href=http://extjs.com/">Ext js 1.1</a>.</p> 
 
<p>The types for intra-aggregation relationships as well as metadata
terms for aggregated objects are described by an OWL ontology which
can be specified in the options. We have developed an OWL ontology to
use with LORE that describes the AustLit data model, which is based on
IFLA FRBR. In this screen cast we are also using a very simple
ontology created to demonstrate how LORE can be used to use compound
objects to share teaching resources.</p>

</ul>
 
<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>PeekORE is a javascript application that uses preloading and ORE
autodiscovery to decorate links to pages representing ORE
aggregations. It then allows users to quickly view and click through
to the contents of an aggregation in a dynamic popup pane, without
leaving the original page. It was inspired by the general coolness of
feed autodiscovery, ORE autodiscovery, and Stacks, a glossy feature in
OS X Leopard.</p>
 
<p>Kudos: The code uses the <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery
library</a> for all of its DOM manipulation, AJAX and event
handling. jQuery is awesome.  Pulling data from the <a
href="http://ora.ouls.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Research Archive</a> made this
much, much easier. Thanks to Oxford Uni Library, and especially to Ben
O'Steen for getting running such a cutting edge production system.</p>
