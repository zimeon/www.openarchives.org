		<h2><a name="tocRange" id="tocRange"></a>1. <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
		<p>The Architecture of the World Wide Web [<a href="#Web_Architecture">Web
		Architecture</a>]  uses the term <em>Resource</em> to refer to any item of interest.  A Resource can be anything at all, including an aggregation of other Resources.  
		Examples of these aggregations are:</p>
<ul>
			<li>A simple unordered set, or bag, of Resources, such as a collection 
			of favorite images from various Web sites.</li>
			<li>A multi-page, HTML document where the pages are linked together 
			by hyperlinks that provide &quot;previous page&quot; and &quot;next page&quot; access.</li>
			<li>Information available from &quot;social networking&quot; sites, such as
			<a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com">
			YouTube</a>, and <a href="http://www.myspace.com">myspace</a>.&nbsp; 
			Information in flickr, for example, consists of an entry page, a single 
			Resource, that links to comments or annotations (each existing as a 
			separate Resource), and&nbsp; an image in&nbsp; multiple sizes and resolutions, 
			each also existing as a separate Resource.&nbsp; </li>
			<li>A scholarly publication stored in an ePrint repository such as
			<a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a> or in a
			<a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a>,
			<a href="http://www.eprints.org">ePrints</a>, or
			<a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/">Fedora</a> repository.&nbsp; 
			Such a publication may appear on the Web as multiple Resources, each 
			with an individual URI.&nbsp; The set of Resources typically consists 
			of a human readable &quot;splash page&quot;, that links to the body of the publication 
			in multiple formats such as LaTeX, PDF, and HTML.&nbsp; In addition, 
			the publication may have citation links to other publications, each 
			existing as one or more Resources.</li>
			<li>An <em>overlay journal issue </em>that aggregates multiple scholarly 
			publications as described above, each located in their origin repository, 
			into an <em>issue</em>.&nbsp; Issues may be recursively aggregated themselves 
			into <em>volumes</em>, and then into the <em>journal </em>itself.</li>
			<li>A semantically-linked group of cellular images - each available 
			as a Resource resident in repositories from research laboratories, museums, 
			libraries, and the like - in the manner implemented in the
			<a href="http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk">ImageWeb Project</a>.</li>
			<li>Published scientific results such as those envisioned by&nbsp; [<a href="#Lynch_CTWatch">Lynch 
			CTWatch</a>] that, in addition to the features of the scholarly publication 
			described above, incorporate data plus the tools to visualize and analyze 
			that data.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These aggregations exhibit the following characteristics:</p>
		<ul>
          <li>They consist of one or more Resources, which all may be 
            located on one web server, or may be distributed over the Web.</li>
		  <li>Relationsips  may exist  between  Resources in the aggregation
		    that express semantics indicating that one Resource has a containment 
		    relationship to another, one is an alternate version or format of another, 
		    and the like.</li>
		  <li>One or more of the  Resources in the aggregation may have type semantics 
		    defined by various vocabularies.&nbsp; Informal examples of such types 
		    are &quot;splash page&quot;, &quot;bibliography&quot;, or &quot;table of contents&quot;.</li>
		  <li>Relationships may exist  between the aggregation and/or the 
		    individual  Resources in the aggregation and information units external to the 
		    Aggregation.&nbsp; 
		    These external resources may be individual Resources or aggregations 
		    themselves.&nbsp; Examples of such relationships include citation, mirrors, 
		    and translations.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>A mechanism to associate identities with these aggregations and describe 
		them in a machine-readable manner would make them visible to Web agents, 
		both humans and machines.&nbsp; This could be useful for a number of applications 
		and contexts.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
			<li>Crawler-based search engines could use such descriptions to index 
			information and provide search results sets at the granularity of the 
			aggregations rather or in addition to their individual parts.</li>
			<li>Browsers could leverage them to provide users with navigation aids 
			for the aggregated resources, in the same manner that
			<a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">machine-readable site maps</a> provide 
			navigation clues for crawlers.</li>
			<li>Other automated agents such as preservation systems could use these 
			descriptions as guides to understand a &quot;whole document&quot; and determine 
			the
			best preservation strategy [<a href="#Compound_Object">Compound_Object</a>].</li>
			<li>Systems that mine and analyze networked information for citation 
			analysis/bibliometrics could achieve better accuracy with the knowledge 
			of aggregation structure contained in these descriptions.&nbsp; </li>
			<li>These machine-readable descriptions could provide the foundation 
			for advanced scholarly communication systems that allow the flexible 
			reuse and refactoring of rich scholarly artifacts and their components 
			[<a href="#Value_Chains">Value Chains</a>][<a href="#SCOPE">SCOPE</a>].&nbsp; </li>
		</ul>
	  <p>This specification describes the <em>ORE Model</em> that makes it possible to associate an identity with aggregations of Resources 
		and&nbsp; provide descriptions of their structure and semantics.&nbsp; It 
		introduces the <a href="#Resource_Map">Resource Map (ReM</a>), which 
		is a Resource that, in the manner of a Named Graph [<a href="#Named_Graph">Named 
		Graph</a>], encapsulates a set of RDF [<a href="#RDF_Concepts">RDF Concepts</a>] 
		triples.&nbsp; These triples instantiate an aggregation as a Resource 
		with a URI, express metadata about the aggregation, enumerate the constituents of the aggregation 
		and the relationships among those constituents, and describe the 
		relationships of the aggregation to other Resources on the Web.&nbsp; 
		This data model conforms to the concepts defined in the Architecture of 
		the World Wide Web [<a href="#Web_Architecture">Web Architecture</a>].		</p>
	  <p>The ORE Model can be implemented in a variety of serialization formats.&nbsp; 
		The details of these formats are described in companion ORE documents.&nbsp; 
		The nature of a particular serialization format and its respective expressiveness 
		may affect the details of the mapping from the model to the implementation.&nbsp; 
		This mapping is described in detail in each serialization specification.
		</p>
		<p>This specification is one of several documents comprising the
		<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/toc">OAI-ORE specifications and 
		user guides</a>.</p>

<h2>2. <a name="Architecture_foundations">Architecture foundations</a></h2>
<h3>2.1 <a name="Web-Arch">Web Architecture</a></h3>
		<p>A full description of Web Architecture concepts is contained in [<a href="#Web_Architecture">Web 
		Architecture</a>].&nbsp; For the remainder of this document, the use of 
		the following terms from the Web Architecture SHOULD be interpreted as briefly 
		summarized below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>Resource</em> - an item of interest.</li>
			<li><em>URI</em> - a uniform global identifier 
			for a Resource [<a href="#URI">URI</a>].&nbsp; This document specializes 
			this with the notion of a <span class="code">Protocol-Based</span> URI, 
			which is a URI that can be <em>de-referenced</em> via a common protocol 
			to provide access to a Representation.&nbsp; The most common example 
			of this in the current implementation of the Web is HTTP [<a href="#RFC2616">RFC2616</a>]			</li>
		  <li><em>Representation</em> - a data stream corresponding 
			to the state of a Resource at the time of a dereference of its protocol-based 
			URI.&nbsp; The Web Architecture allows for multiple Representations 
			of a Resource with access mediated by <em>Content 
			Negotiation</em>. </li>
		  <li><em>Link</em> - a directed connection between 
			two Resources.&nbsp; In most common usage, a link is expressed via link 
			or anchor tags (a <em>hyperlink) </em>in an HTML Representation of the 
			originating Resource to the URI of another Resource.&nbsp; An extension 
			of this, where links are typed relationships, is explained below.</li>
	  </ul>
		<p>The combination of these concepts forms what is commonly referred to
		as the <em>Web Graph</em>, with nodes that are URIs (which identify Resources), from which Representations are made available, and edges
		that are Links. An example of a Web graph is shown below.&nbsp; Note 
		that this example shows that the Web graph is not necessarily connected 
		- nodes <span class="code">O</span>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <span class="code">P</span> 
		link to each other but not to other nodes in the graph.</p>

<p class="figure"><img alt="Depiction of general web graph" src="datamodel-images/WebGraphBase.jpg" width="438" height="300" /></p>

<h3>2.2 <a name="Semantic_Web_and_RDF">Semantic Web and RDF</a></h3>
		<p>This specification also leverages Semantic Web concepts from RDF [<a href="#RDF_Concepts">RDF
		Concepts</a>].&nbsp;In RDF, Resources are described using sets of <em>triples</em>,
		each made up of three parts: a <em class="code">subject</em>, a <em class="code">predicate</em> 
		and an <em class="code">object</em>. The subject is a URI that identifies the described Resource;
		the object is either the URI of a second Resource or a <em class="code">literal</em> that 
		identifies values such as numbers and dates by means of a lexical representation; and the Predicate is a URI
		that identifies a type of relationship. Each triple states that a relationship of the type
		indicated by the Predicate (a URI) holds between the Resource identified by the subject (a URI) and the
		object (a URI or a Literal).</p>
	  <p>A set of RDF triples is referred to as an <em class="code">RDF Graph</em> because it can
		  be represented as  a node and directed-arc diagram, in which each triple is represented as a node-arc-node link.
		  The <em class="code">nodes</em> of an RDF Graph are the subjects and objects of the constituent triples.
		  In an RDF Graph each node is connected to at least one other node in the graph.</p>
	  <p>Note: this is a slight simplification of the RDF model because it ignores the concept of &quot;blank nodes&quot;. The ORE model does not make use of &quot;blank nodes&quot; and they are not discussed
		  further in this document</p>
	  <p>An example of an RDF Graph
		is shown in the figure below. As shown, the subject and Predicate
		of a triple are always URIs (the URI is indicated by the text in the
		yellow circle and shown with bracketed syntax <span class="code">&lt;A&gt; </span>in the table) and the object may be a URI or a literal (shown
	  as a blue rounded rectangle in the graph and in quotations in the table).</p>

<p class="figure"><img alt="Example RDF graph and triples" src="datamodel-images/Triples.jpg" width="468" height="253" /></p>

		<p>Another tool from the Semantic Web, the RDF Vocabulary
		Description Language [<a href="#RDFS">RDFS</a>], provides the mechanisms
		to define vocabularies for defining the types of these relationships.&nbsp;
		In combination with the RDF-defined relationship <span class="code">rdf:type </span>this vocabulary makes it possible to express types for Resources.
		The figure below shows an example of this.&nbsp; As shown, the objects of
		the triples with <span class="code">rdf:type</span> Predicates are URIs, that denote classes or types.</p>

<p class="figure"><img alt="Use of rdf:type" src="datamodel-images/types.jpg" width="555" height="185" /></p>

<h3>2.3 <a name="Named_Graphs">Named Graphs</a></h3>
		<p>Finally, this specification builds on the notion of a Named Graph [<a href="#Named_Graph">Named 
		Graph</a>], which extends RDF to allow the association of a name - a URI 
		- with a set of triples - a graph.&nbsp; A number of aspects of Named Graphs 
		are shown in the figure below.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Named Graph is a Resource, identified by a URI. That URI can be the subject or object of  triples. These triples can, for example, express a type for the Named Graph, or associate metadata
			  properties (e.g., <span class="code">dc:creator</span>) with the Named
			  Graph. The figure shows a graph that represents three triples in which the URI
			    of the Named Graph <span class="code">NG-A</span> occurs as subject or object&nbsp; </li>
		  <li>The Named Graph is NOT the RDF Graph itself.&nbsp; Instead it is a
			  Resource with a Representation that encodes a set of triples that form the graph.&nbsp; The relationship
			  between the Named Graph and the RDF Graph that its Representations encode is defined
			  via a function <span class="code"><em>rdfgraph</em></span>. The
			  semantics of a Named Graph are similar to RDF
			    reification [<a href="#RDF_Semantics">RDF Semantics</a>], in the manner that they allow the assertion of relationships between other Resources and the set of triples. This provides the basis for signing, authority, and trust.&nbsp; This is relevant
			  in this specification where Named Graphs are being used to provide
			  descriptions of citable intellectual objects.</li>
	  </ul>

<p class="figure"><img alt="Named Graph" src="datamodel-images/Named%20Graph.jpg" width="581" height="395" /></p>
		<h2><a name="CO" id="CO"></a>3. <a name="Aggregations">Aggregation</a></h2>
		<p>The introduction to this document introduced the concept of an aggregation in informal terms in order to outline the sort of problems the ORE Model seeks to address. The purpose of this section is to define more formally a class of Resources calledl Aggregations.</p>
		<p>An <span class="definition">Aggregation</span> is a set of Resources which together form a &quot;logical unit&quot;. Each of the individual Resources that compose an Aggregation is referred to as an <span class="definition">Aggregated Resource</span>. A Relationship of type <span class="code">ore:aggregates</span> exists between an Aggregation and each Aggregated Resource.</p>
		<p>In some cases, Relationships may be asserted to exist between the Aggregated Resources that constitute an Aggregation; in other cases, no Relationships are asserted to exist between the Aggregated Resources.</p>
		<p>In some cases, Relationships may be asserted to exist between the Aggregated Resources and other Resources; in other cases, no such Relationships are asserted to exist.</p>
		<p>Each Aggregation is described by a single Resource Map. The concept of the Resource Map is defined in the following section.</p>
	  <h2>4. <a name="Resource_Map">Resource Map (ReM)</a></h2>
		<p>A <span class="definition">Resource Map </span>(<span class="definition">ReM</span>) 
		is a Resource that specifies a URI for an Aggregation and describes its composition, 
		properties, and relationships to other Resources. It does this 
		via a set of triples, an<a href="#RDF_Graph"> RDF Graph</a>, in the same 
		manner as a Named Graph.&nbsp; This Graph has a <a href="#RDF_Graph">well-defined 
		structure</a>.</p>
	  <p>A Relationship of type <span class="code">ore:describes</span> exists between a Resource Map and an Aggregation. For each Aggregation, there exists exactly one Resource Map that describes the Aggregation; and for each Resource Map, there exists exactly one Aggregation that is described by that Resource Map. In other words, the <span class="code">ore:describes</span> Relationship is an <span class="code">owl:InverseFunctional </span>[<a href="#OWL">OWL</a>] Property.</p>

<h3>4.1 <a name="URI-R">Identification of a Resource Map (URI-R)</a></h3>
		<p>Because a Resource Map is a Resource, it is uniquely identified by a 
		URI. This specification uses URI-R to denote URIs that identify Resource 
		Maps.&nbsp; A URI-R MUST be a Protocol-Based URI .&nbsp; A Resource Map may have multiple Representations, each of which is referred to as a <span class="definition">Resource Map Document</span>. These Representations MAY differ by character encoding, expressiveness, compression, and other 
		characteristics, The syntax of these Representations is particular 
		to each serialization format, each of which is defined in companion
		<a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/toc">ORE specifications</a>.&nbsp;Each serialization format MUST have well-defined rules for deterministically mapping to triples that conform to the <a href="#RDF_Graph">well-defined 
		structure</a> of a Resource Map. Some serialization formats MAY have reduced expressiveness and therefore MAY not include all features of the data model described here.</p>

<h3>4.2 <a name="Identification_of_an_Aggregation">Identification of an Aggregation (URI-A)</a></h3>
		<p>As noted above, this specification uses URI-A to denote URIs that identify Aggregations.&nbsp; 
		A URI-A MUST be unique relative to the one Resource Map that describes the respective Aggregation.&nbsp; This one-to-one relationship 
		between a URI-R and its corresponding URI-A is syntactically enforced. A 
		URI-A MUST be constructed by appending a
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#fragid">fragment identifier</a> to the URI-R, which MUST be the string  <span class="code">#aggregation</span>. For example, 
		the URI-R <span class="code">http://sample.org/ReM-1 </span>would be the 
		Resource Map that describes the Aggregation with URI-A
		<span class="code">http://sample.org/ReM-1#aggregation</span>.</p>
	  <p>Note that as defined in [<a href="#URI">URI</a>], resolution of a fragment 
		identifier is left to the client, after resolution of the URI - stripped 
		of the fragment - by the server.&nbsp;Therefore,  any request to a server to dereference URI-A results in a dereference of URI-R.</p>

<h3>4.3 <a name="Semantics_of_URI-A_and_URI-R">Semantics of URI-A and URI-R</a></h3>
		<p>Note that a URI-A denotes an Aggregation, and the corresponding URI-R 
		denotes a Resource Map that describes that Aggregation.&nbsp; Clients SHOULD 
		recognize this distinction when linking to or expressing relationships with 
		a URI-R or URI-A.&nbsp; Notably, a relationship, such as a citation link, 
		to the &quot;intellectual object&quot;&nbsp; SHOULD use URI-A rather than URI-R, since 
		the latter denotes a citation of the Resource Map, which is usually not 
		the intended target of a citation.</p>

<h2>5. <a name="RDF_Graph">RDF Graph of a Resource Map</a></h2>
		<p>A Resource Map is a specialization of a Named Graph.&nbsp;
		Like any Named Graph it is a Resource - a first-class object in the Web
		Architecture - that expresses an RDF Graph via the triples it encodes.&nbsp;
		In a general Named Graph, the structure and composition of&nbsp; the RDF Graph expressed by the triples&nbsp; are not defined, and there are no restrictions on the Resources identified by nodes in the graph.</p>
	  <p>The RDF Graph expressed by a Resource Map must conform to a number of restrictions. The graph&nbsp; MUST be 
		connected, with its structure defined as follows (and expanded upon in the 
		numbered section accompanying each bullet):</p>
<ul>
			<li>It MUST express the relationship between the Resource Map and Aggregation 
			(<a href="#ReM-to-aggr">5.1</a>).</li>
			<li>It MUST express basic metadata about the Resource Map and MAY 
			express 
			additional metadata about the Resource Map (<a href="#Metadata_about_the_ReM">5.2</a>).</li>
			<li>It MAY express identifiers of the Aggregation other than URI-A (<a href="#Other_ids">5.3</a>).</li>
			<li>It MUST express the relationships between the Aggregation and one or more Aggregated Resources that are constituents
			of the Aggregation. (The subgraph of the Resource Map resulting from these relationships is referred to as the Aggregation Graph) (<a href="#Defining_the_aggregated_resources">5.4</a>).&nbsp;</li>
			<li>It MAY express Internal relationships among Resources identified by  nodes in the Aggregation 
			Graph (<a href="#Internal_Relationships">5.5</a>).</li>
			<li>It MAY express External relationships between Resources identified by nodes in the Aggregation 
			Graph and Resources not identified by nodes in the Aggregation Graph (<a href="#context">5.6</a>).</li>

	  <p>A complete example of the RDF Graph expressed by a Resource Map is shown

<h3>5.1 <a name="ReM-to-aggr">Relationship between a Resource Map and an Aggregation</a></h3>
		<p>A Resource Map MUST establish a relationship to its respective Aggregation
		via a triple with an <span class="code">ore:describes</span> Predicate, where the
		subject is  URI-R and the object is  the <a href="#Identification_of_an_Aggregation">corresponding URI-A</a>.&nbsp;
		The <span class="code">ore:describes</span> relationship defines that the Resource denoted by the subject is a resource of type <span class="code">ore:ResourceMap </span> and the Resource denoted by the  object is a resource of type <span class="code">ore:Aggregation</span>.&nbsp;
		Therefore, the explicit inclusion in the Resource Map of triples asserting these types is
		OPTIONAL.</p>
		<p>The <span class="code">ore:isDescribedBy</span> relationship is the inverse of <span class="code">ore:describes</span>. Semantically,<span class="code"> ore:isDescribedBy</span>&nbsp; has 
			  an <span class="code"> owl:inverseOf </span>[<a href="#OWL">OWL</a>] relationship to <span class="code">ore:describes</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			  This means that every triple of the form <span class="code">&lt;ResourceMap&gt;&nbsp;&lt;ore:describes&gt; 
			    &lt;Aggregation&gt;</span> implies the inverse triple <span class="code">&lt;Aggregation&gt; &lt;ore:isDescribedBy&gt; 
        &lt;ResourceMap&gt;,</span>&nbsp; and vice versa. A Resource Map SHOULD NOT include these implied <span class="code">ore:isDescribedBy</span> triples.</p>
	  <p> The figure below illustrates the triples asserting the relationship between a Resource Map and an Aggregation and the resulting RDF
		graph.&nbsp; The implied types for each Resource are also shown.&nbsp;
		The table to the right of the triples shows the URIs used to identify the Resources and
		relationships.</p>

<h3>5.2 <a name="Metadata_about_the_ReM">Metadata about the Resource Map</a></h3>
		<p>A Resource Map MUST express minimal metadata properties about the Resource 
		Map.&nbsp; Those metadata properties are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Some identity of the authoring authority (human, organization, or 
			agent) of the Resource Map, using the <span class="code">dc:creator
			</span>term.&nbsp; This SHOULD be used by consuming clients as one means 
			of establishing trustworthiness of the information in the Resource Map.&nbsp; 
			The exact mechanisms for author identification and digital signing of 
			that identification are out of scope of this specification.</li>
			<li>The last modification date-timestamp of the Resource Map, using the
			<span class="code">dcterms:modified </span>term.&nbsp; This date-timestamp 
			MUST accurately reflect when the Resource Map was last changed so that 
			consuming clients of the can determine appropriate actions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A Resource Map MAY include additional metadata properties about the Resource 
		Map.&nbsp; Examples of additional metadata properties are:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Rights information related to the use of the Resource Map, using 
			the <span class="code">dc:rights </span>term.&nbsp; </li>
			<li>The initial creation datetimestamp of the Resource Map, using the
			<span class="code">dcterms:created </span>term.&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
	  <p>The figure below shows an RDF Graph 
		expressed 
		by a Resource Map that includes metadata properties about Resource Map.&nbsp; Note that aspects of the graph already described 
		are grayed-out (this convention will be used for the remainder of this section). 
		Note also that in this example, the objects of all the metadata relationships 
		are literals.&nbsp; Alternatively, the objects may be URIs denoting other Resources.</p>

<h3>5.3 <a name="Other_ids">Other identifiers of the Aggregation</a></h3>

<div class="open-issue" id="Use_of_owl_sameAs">There is some uncertainty over whether this is an appropriate use of owl:sameAs, which by some interpretations implies an exact equivalence between the subject and object of triples with this predicate. Indeed, we do not mean exact equivalence but an assertion of semantic equivalence.</div>

	  <p>In some cases there may exist other identifiers for the Resource identified by URI-A.&nbsp; These identifiers may be protocol-based URIs such as the HTTP URI of a <em>splash page </em>for a document in an institutional repository, a non-protocol-based URI such as a DOI [<a href="#DOI">DOI</a>], or some other form of identifier. The Resource Map MAY express the existance of these other identifiers via triples with the <span class="code">owl:sameAs </span>[<a href="#OWL">OWL</a>] Predicate, where the subject is the URI of the Aggregation and the object is the other identifier. Note that the semantics of <span class="code">owl:sameAs</span> state that the two URIs serving as subject and object of the respective triple are interchangable and any node in a triple that matches one of the &quot;sameAs&quot; URIs can be replaced with a node that is the corresponding URI.</p>
	  <p>The addition of this information about other identifiers to the RDF Graph is shown below.</p>

<p class="figure"><img alt="Other identifiers of the Aggregation" src="datamodel-images/AggrSameAs.jpg" width="598" height="427" /></p>

<h3>5.4 <a name="Defining_the_aggregated_resources">Aggregated Resources and Aggregation Graph</a></h3>
		<p>An <a href="#Aggregations">Aggregation</a> consists of one or more Aggregated
		Resources, which are logically the constituents of the Aggregation.&nbsp;
		To enumerate these,&nbsp; the Resource Map MUST express one or more triples
		where the subject is the URI of the respective Aggregation, the Predicate is&nbsp; <span class="code">ore:aggregates</span>, and the object is URI of  a Resource
		that MUST NOT be the Resource Map or the Aggregation itself.&nbsp; Note
		that a Resource MAY be expressed as an Aggregated Resource by multiple
		Resource Maps. The <span class="code">ore:aggregates</span> relationship
		defines
		that the Resource denoted by the subject is a Resource of type <span class="code">ore:aggregation </span>and the Resource denoted by the object is a Resource of type <span class="code">ore:AggregatedResource</span>.&nbsp;
		Therefore, the explicit inclusion in the Resource Map of triples asserting these types is
		OPTIONAL.</p>
		<p>The figure below shows the RDF Graph&nbsp; that results from the triples
		  expressed by the Resource Map that have the Predicate <span class="code"> ore:aggregates</span> in color.&nbsp; This subgraph of the RDF Graph
		  is known as the <span class="definition">Aggregation Graph</span>.&nbsp;
		  The implied types for each Aggregated Resource are also shown.
	    The remaining nodes are in grey.</p>

<p class="figure"><img alt="Aggregated Resources and Aggregation Graph" src="datamodel-images/ReMAggregates.jpg" width="629" height="486" /></p>

        <p>For a Resource Map <span class="code">http://example.org/ReM-1</span>, the Aggregation Graph is defined by the following SPARQL query [<a href="#SPARQL">SPARQL</a>]</p>

<div class="exampleInner">

<h3>5.5 <a name="Internal_Relationships">Internal Relationships</a></h3>

<div class="open-issue" id="Is_the_Internal_External_distinction_helpful">The distinction between internal and external relationships may prove to be more confusing than useful and may be excluded from future versions.</div>

      <p>As described in the previous sections, the minimal RDF Graph expressed 
		by a Resource Map expressees properties of the Resource Map itself and 
		expresses 
		the relationship of the Resource Map to the corresponding Aggregation.&nbsp; 
		In addition, via the <span class="code">ore:aggregates</span> Predicate, 
		it expresses the Aggregation Graph that defines the Resources that are constituents 
		of the <a href="#Aggregations">Aggregation</a>, the Aggregated Resources.
		</p>
		<p>As defined thus far, there are no relationships among the Aggregated Resources, shown 
		above as&nbsp; <span class="code">AR-1</span>, <span class="code">AR-2</span>, 
		and <span class="code">AR-3, </span> except for their status as 
		constituents of the Aggregation.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Resource Map MAY express relationships among the Resources denoted by the nodes in the Aggregation Graph, in 
		addition to the minimal <span class="code">ore:aggregates</span> relationships.&nbsp; 
		relationships where both the subject and object are nodes in the Aggregation 
		Graph are <span class="definition">Internal Relationships</span>.&nbsp; These 
		relationships may be useful for describing the structure of the aggregation 
		with semantics such as containment, format variation, and the like.&nbsp; 
		The Predicates of triples asserting Internal Relationships MAY be defined by any vocabulary.</p>
	  <p>The figure below shows the addition of a triple asserting an Internal Relationship to the 
		RDF Graph defined by the Resource Map.</p>

<p class="figure"><img alt="Internal Relationships" src="datamodel-images/IntRels.jpg" width="662" height="430" /></p>

        <p>For a Resource Map <span class="code">ReM-1</span>, the RDF Graph containing the Triples which assert Internal Relationships is defined by the following SPARQL query [<a href="#SPARQL">SPARQL</a>]:</p>

<div class="exampleInner">

</div>

<h3>5.6 <a name="context">External Relationships of an Aggregation</a></h3>
		<p>The RDF Graph expressed by a Resource Map MAY contain triples that reference
		Resources that are not denoted by nodes in the Aggregation Graph.&nbsp; In addition it MAY contain triples where the subject is a node in the Aggregation Graph and the object is a literal.  These are known as <em class="definition">External Relationships.</em> Note that a Resource Map MUST NOT contain triples where the subject is not a node in the Aggregation Graph and the object is a literal. These are useful for expressing two types of information:</p>
<ul>
          <li>They may define the semantic types of the nodes in the Aggregation Graph.&nbsp;
            These triples MUST have a subject that is a node in the Aggregation
            Graph (the URI of  either the Aggregation or an Aggregated Resource), a predicate
            that is <span class="code">rdf:type</span>, and an object that is the URI of a
            Class defined by any vocabulary.</li>
		  <li>They may define the relationships of the Aggregation or an Aggregated Resource  to other Resources.&nbsp;
		    Either the subject or object of the triples expressing these relationships
		    MUST be&nbsp; a node in the Aggregation Graph and the Predicate MAY
		    be defined in any vocabulary.&nbsp; These relationships are useful for
		    metadata properites of the Aggregation Graph and/or the Aggregation, citation linkages, lineage links, mirrors, and the like.&nbsp; </li>
	  </ul>
		<p>The figure below shows the addition of triples asserting External Relationships expressing
		  type semantics and other relationships to the Aggregation Graph.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;
	 </p>

<p class="figure"><img alt="External Relationships" src="datamodel-images/ExtRels.jpg" width="610" height="532" /></p>

        <p>For a Resource Map <span class="code">ReM-1</span>, the RDF Graph containing the Triples which assert External Relationships is defined by the following SPARQL query [<a href="#SPARQL">SPARQL</a>]:</p>
<div class="open-issue" id="Need_SPARQL_for_External_Relationships">SPARQL query to extract Triples which assert External Relationships is needed.</div>

<h3>5.7 <a name="isAggregatedBy" id="isAggregatedBy">Relationships to other Aggregations</a></h3>
			<p>  Every triple of the form <span class="code">&lt;Aggregation&gt; &lt;ore:aggregates&gt; &lt;Resource&gt;</span> implies the inverse triple <span class="code">&lt;Resource&gt; &lt;ore:isAggregatedBy&gt;    &lt;Aggregation&gt;</span>. Formally,
			  <span class="code">ore:isAggregatedBy</span>  has an <span class="code">owl:inverseOf</span> [<a href="#OWL">OWL</a>] relationship to <span class="code">ore:aggregates</span>.  
	  </p>
<p>Triples of the form <span class="code">&lt;Resource&gt; &lt;ore:isAggregatedBy&gt; 
			  &lt;Aggregation&gt;</span> MAY be included in a Resource Map to assert that an 
			  Aggregated Resource is also an Aggregated Resource of another Aggregation.&nbsp;The assertion in a Resource Map of <span class="code"> ore:isAggregatedBy </span>relationships is OPTIONAL and dependent on use 
			  case .&nbsp;&nbsp; When appropriate for a use case (e.g. providing a scholarly citation, establishing lineage, or facilitating discovery), it is RECOMMENDED that a Resource Map  include 
			  triples with<span class="code"> ore:isAggregatedBy </span>Predicates only when the Aggregation that is 
			  the object of the triple 
			  is described 
			  by another Resource Map, thereby establishing them as <a href="#context">external 
			    relationships</a> of the Aggregation.&nbsp; Inclusion in a Resource Map of triples with<span class="code"> ore:isAggregatedBy </span>as <a href="#Internal_Relationships">internal 
			    relationships</a> (the subject and object are members of the respective 
			  Aggregation Graph) is OPTIONAL, since these are implied by <span class="code">ore:aggregates </span>relationships that are already asserted in that Resource Map.</p>
	  <p>Because the assertion of <span class="code">ore:isAggregatedBy</span> is OPTIONAL,  a&nbsp;  client MUST NOT assume that a triple with an <span class="code">ore:aggregates</span> Predicate has a corresponding inverse triple with an <span class="code">ore:isAggregatedBy </span>Predicate in the same or another Resource Map .</p>

	  <h4>5.7.1 <a name="Aggregated_Resources_and_external_Aggregations" id="Aggregated_Resources_and_external_Aggregations">Aggregated Resources and external Aggregations</a></h4>
			<p>A use case demonstrating the use of <span class="code"> ore:isAggregatedBy </span> to make assertions about the relationship between 
			  Aggregated Resources and other Aggregations is illustrated in the figure 
			  below.&nbsp; The Aggregation (<span class="code">A-3</span>)<em>, </em>described by the Resource Map <span class="code">ReM-3</span>, is 
			  a <em> journal, </em>where the Aggregated Resources, <span class="code">AR-3 </span> and <span class="code">AR-4,</span> are selected scholarly papers<span class="code">. </span>As shown, <span class="code">AR-3</span> is included in two other Aggregations, <span class="code">A-1</span> and <span class="code">A-2</span>, which are themselves  journals.&nbsp; The authority managing <span class="code">AR-3 </span>would like to make the inclusion in the other 
			  journals visible to clients accessing the  journal.&nbsp; Therefore, the 
			  Resource Map describing <span class="code">A-3 </span>includes triples 
			  with the Predicate <span class="code">ore:isAggregatedBy</span>, 
			  asserting such relationships between <span class="code">AR-3 </span>and <span class="code">A-1</span> and between <span class="code">AR-3</span> and <span class="code">A-2</span>.</p>

<p class="figure"><img alt="isAggregatedBy" src="datamodel-images/extLinkAggregatedBy.jpg" width="607" height="427" /></p>

			<h4>5.7.2 <a name="nestedAggregations" id="nestedAggregations">Relationships among nested Aggregations</a></h4>
			<p>Another use case of the <span class="code">ore:isAggregatedBy </span>relationship is nested 
			  Aggregations, where the Aggregated Resources of one Aggregation are 
			  themselves Aggregations described by other Resources Maps.&nbsp; An example 
			  of a nested Aggregation is a <em>journal </em>consisting of multiple <em>issues</em>, each of which is 
			  an Aggregation of multiple <em>articles</em>, each of which may be an 
			  Aggregation in its own right.&nbsp; The figure below illustrates nested Aggregations, 
			  omitting some details of previous figures (e.g. metadata, typing).&nbsp; 
			  Aggregation <span class="code">A-1 </span>described by<span class="code"> ReM-1 </span>has constituents<span class="code"> AR-1</span>, <span class="code">AR-2</span> and <span class="code">AR-3</span>, which are   
			  are themselves Aggregations.&nbsp; Each of these &quot;aggregated Aggregations&quot; 
			  is described by a corresponding Resource Map (<span class="code">ReM-2</span>, <span class="code">ReM-3</span>, and <span class="code">ReM-4</span>) 
			  which describes the Aggregated Resources and other aspects of these 
			  Aggregations.</p>

<p class="figure"><img alt="recursive" src="datamodel-images/recursive.jpg" width="534" height="373" /></p>

			<p>The authority authoring and managing a nested Aggregation MAY 
			  choose to inform consuming clients of the &quot;part/whole&quot; nature of 
			  such nested Aggregations by including triples with the <span class="code">ore:isAggregatedBy </span>Predicate in the 
			  Resource Maps that describe the nested Aggregations.&nbsp; In this 
			  manner a client accessing one of the issues has direct access back 
			  to the aggregating journal. The figure below illustrates this use of the <span class="code">ore:isAggregated</span> relationship for nested Aggregations.&nbsp; This is the same &quot;journal/issue&quot; example shown above, 
			  but simplified to show only one &quot;issue&quot; <span class="code">AR-1</span>, 
			  aggregated in the &quot;journal&quot; <span class="code">A-1</span>.&nbsp; As 
			  shown, <span class="code">ReM-2</span> expresses a <span class="code"> ore:isAggregated </span>relationship for its respective nested Aggregation, <span class="code">AR-1</span> thereby providing information about 
			  the &quot;containment&quot; of <span class="code">AR-1</span>, the &quot;issue&quot;, in <span class="code">A-1</span>, the &quot;journal&quot;.</p>
