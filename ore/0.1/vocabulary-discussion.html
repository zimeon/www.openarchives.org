<div class="body">
<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This document is designed to be a staging area for vocabulary terms that
have been proposed for the main OAI-ORE Vocabulary document. It lists
Properties, Relationships and Classes from vocabularies other than the
ORE specific vocabulary.
Each entry below has the following information, and any new entries
submitted should follow the same layout.
</p><dl>
<dt>Title</dt>
<dd>A heading for the entry</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>A free text description of when the term should be used.</dd>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>The name of the term in the vocabulary it comes from</dd>
<dt>URI</dt>
<dd>The URI which identifies the term, if one exists</dd>
<dt>ORE Entities</dt>
<dd>How the term should be used with the 4 primary ORE entities</dd>
<dt>Use Cases</dt>
<dd>Motivation for why this term should be included in the main vocabulary</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<div class="body">
<h2><a name="properties" id="properties"></a>2. Properties</h2>
<p>The Properties in the vocabulary document are reasonably firm decisions, 
however exactly which entities they can be applied to is still very much up for debate.
In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>As an Aggregation is tied directly to the Resource Map, should it be allowed to have different properties to the Resource Map?  For example, is the creator of the Aggregation necessarily the same as the Resource Map?</li>
<li>The time of last modification for the Aggregation can certainly be different to that of the resource map, if the change was to an external entity (and hence not part of the Aggregation). Here is one property that seems like it must be able to be different.</li>
<li>Which properties should be expressed about Aggregated Resources?  We don't want to get into the field of re-expressing everything in Dublin Core or more in Resource Maps, that information should be in related documents. (See rdfs:seeAlso)  However some basic information would be useful for processors... what information?</li>
<li>Should we be able to express properties for External Resources at all? As above, we don't want to fill the Resource Map with potentially out of date information about resources that aren't even part of the Aggregation.  However, without at least a pointer to where an agent can find more information about the resource, the identifier is potentially completely useless (if it's not de-referencable and not a known scheme, for example).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional Specific properties:</p>
<dl>

<dt>Format</dt>
<dd>
The file format of the entity, typically a string literal containing a
MIME type. Other possible format specifications include Apple's Uniform
Type Identifier and Pronom's format identifier.
<ul>
<li>Name: dc:format</li>
<li>URI: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/format</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> MUST NOT have a format. It is an abstract object.</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MAY have a format. If present, it MUST be "application/atom+xml"</li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> SHOULD have a format. It SHOULD be a mimetype, or drawn from a publically accessible set of formats.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> MAY have a format, if they are
dereferencable Resources. It SHOULD be a mimetype, or drawn from a
publically accessible set of formats.</li>
</ul>
<b>Example:</b>
<div class="exampleInner">
<pre>URI-AR-1 dc:format "application/pdf"
</pre>
</div>

<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
<ul>
<li>Format is important for machine processing of files, as neither the identifier nor the transfer protocol may include this information.  For example, the format of "ftp://ftp.somewhere.com/pub/dataset/allRecords" could be in any format.</li>
</ul>
</dd>


<dt>Identifier</dt>
<dd>
A string literal which can be used to unambiguously reference the
entity within the ORE context. An object MAY have more than one
identifier, but an identifier MUST identify exactly one entity. All
identifiers within the OAI-ORE context MUST be URIs. <ul>
<li>Name: dc:identifier</li>
<li>URI: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/identifier</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> MUST have a URI identifier.  It is the URI of the Resource Map that describes it, followed by "#aggregation".</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MUST have an HTTP URI identifier. It MUST NOT be the identifier for the <a href="#aggr">Aggregation</a> or any of the <a href="#ar">Aggregated Resources</a>.  The ORE specified <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/atom">serialisation</a> MUST be available by dereferencing the identifier.</li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MUST have an ultimately dereferencable URI identifier. They may also have additional non URI identifiers.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> MUST have a URI identifier.</li>
</ul>
<b>Example:</b>
<div class="exampleInner">
<pre>URI-AR-1 dc:identifier "http://www.openarchives.org/ore/vocabulary/"
</pre>
</div>

<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
<ul>
<li>Actually, we don't need an identifier property as in order to talk about any object it MUST already have an identifier.  However when serialising, the identifier for the object itself should be present (eg it should be self-identifying)... So does this deserve to be in the main vocabulary, or just a footnote?</li>
</ul>
<br />
</dd>

</dl>


</div>



<div class="body">
<h2><a name="relationships" id="relationships"></a>3. Relationships</h2>
<p>As with properties, the subject and object of many of the relationships is up for debate.</p>

<dl>
<dt>owl:sameAs</dt>
<dd>
Should this be used for expressing equivalency between aggregated resources, or should dcterms:hasFormat be used, or another relationship entirely?

<ul>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MAY have equivalences stated.</li> 
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MAY have equivalences stated.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> SHOULD NOT have equivalences stated.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>And there are many additional relationships which will be important across disciplines.</p>

<dl>


<dt>Additional Metadata</dt>
<dd>The described resource has additional metadata available at, or is otherwise described by, the referenced resource.
<p>
Rather than expressing large amounts of metadata about every resource within the <a href="#rem">Resource Map</a>, it may be desirable to point to a further resource which has this information.  For example, an <a href="#ar">Aggregated Resource</a> might be further described by a file in XML.  <a href="#er">External Resources</a> may also have this relationship, in order to avoid making these assertions in the Resource Map. 
</p><ul>
<li>Name: rdfs:seeAlso</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> MAY have additional metadata in other resources.</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MAY have additional metadata.</li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MAY have additional metadata.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> MAY have additional metadata.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>Citeseer document has pointer to ACM equivalent.</li>
<li>External or Aggregated PDF has a lot of additional metadata known, but not suitable for presenting in the Resource Map.</li>
</ul>
<br />
</dd>



<dt>Audience</dt>
<dd>The intended audience of a resource. The object should be a class
of agent, either Person or SoftwareAgent. For example, a Dataset
resource would be intended for a SoftwareAgent to interact with,
whereas a textual description of that resource would be intended for a
Person.
<ul>
<li>Name:  dcterms:audience</li>
<li>URI:  http://purl.org/dc/terms/audience</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> MUST NOT have an intended audience. They are not experienced directly by any agent.</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MUST NOT have an intended audience. It is SoftwareAgent.</li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MAY have an intended audience.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> SHOULD NOT have an intended audience.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
<ul>
<li>The same resource may be available in different formats, one
intended for human use and the other for machine interpretation. The
formats may not be sufficient information to discern the difference.
For example, a short description in XML with a stylesheet of a dataset
may be useful to a human, whereas the full dataset in XML without a
stylesheet is not.</li>
<li>A 'splash page' is the human equivalent of a Resource Map.
Combined with rdfs:seeAlso (above) we can make this relationship
explicit.</li>
</ul>
<br />

</dd>


<dt>Conformance to Standards</dt>
<dd>A reference to an established standard to which the resource conforms.
<p>
For example, <a href="#rem">Resource Maps</a> may conform to one or
more application or domain profiles. These profiles might specify
additional requirements, or simply list additional vocabularies to use.
</p><p>This MUST NOT be used to denote conformance with a file format,
nor give a semantic type, even if that format or type is a standard.
See the Format property.
</p><ul>
<li>Name: dcterms:conformsTo</li>
<li>URI: http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> MAY conform to a standard.  For example a standard which designates good practices for aggregations of a certain type.</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MAY conform to a standard.</li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MAY conform to a standard.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> SHOULD NOT conform to a standard.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
<ul>
<li>Communities will produce conformance documents or profiles for
recommended best practices in creatingn resource maps. ConformsTo
allows the creator to assert compliance.</li>
<li>Aggregated and External resources may conform to any number
of different non format/non semantic type standards. For example, a
vocabulary might conform to the ISO11179 guidelines.</li>
<li>If the format is text/xml, should conformsTo be used for representing schema/dtd information, or is there a better relationship?</li>
</ul>
<br />
</dd>


<dt>dcterms:hasFormat vs owl:sameAs</dt>
<dd>
<p>
owl:sameAs has the semantics:  
</p><blockquote>
The described resource is intellectually the same as the referenced resource. 
</blockquote>
<p>
dcterms:hasFormat has the semantics:
</p><blockquote>The described resource pre-existed the referenced
resource, which is essentially the same intellectual content presented
in another format.
</blockquote>
<p>The pre-existing notion is troublesome for asserting that two
Aggregated Resources are equivalent. However, it is perhaps a closer
fit for this usage than owl:sameAs? </p>
<br />
</dd>



<dt>References</dt>
<dd>The described resource references, cites, or otherwise points to the referenced resource.
<p>
This is the general relationship for citation, linking and similar. If
communities want to be more specific about the type of citation or
reference, then the relationship should be a child of this one.
Also note that the inverse relationship is frequently used as well and
can easily be accommodated by switching the subject and object. For
example on may wish to list works which cite a component resource,
rather than works which the component resource cites.
</p><ul>
<li>Name: dcterms:references</li>
<li>URI: http://purl.org/dc/terms/references</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> MAY have references.</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MUST NOT have references. </li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MAY have references.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> SHOULD NOT have references.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
<ul>
<li>Citations. What more motivating use case do we have in the scholarly publication world?</li>
<li>But is there a more specific and widely understood relationship that we should be using for such an important one?</li>
</ul>

<br />
</dd>

<dt>Related Resources</dt>
<dd>The described resource is somehow related to the referenced resource.
<p>This is the general relationship for any non reference relationship.
For example, in order to list resources related by topic or genre.
</p><ul>
<li>Name: dc:relation</li>
<li>URI: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/relation</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> MAY have related resources</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MAY have related resources.</li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MAY have related resources.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> SHOULD NOT have related resources.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
<ul>
<li>Most splash pages have links to related or similar resources, eg Citeseer, YouTube etc.</li>
<li>By linking to known, related Resource Maps, we will improve discovery and use.</li>
</ul>

<br />
</dd>


<dt>Replaces</dt>
<dd>The described resource supplants, displaces, or supersedes the referenced resource.
<p>Similar to hasVersion, but the old resource should not be referenced
again in the future. For example, a resource map that does not validate
should be replaced by one that does. However a resource map where a new
relationship has been added or a typo fixed may warrant a hasVersion
relationship instead or as well as. The older document may also wish to
be changed to specify that it is replaced by the new one.
</p><ul>
<li>Name: dcterms:replaces</li>
<li>URI: http://purl.org/dc/terms/replaces</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> MAY replace previous versions.</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MAY replace previous versions. </li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MAY replace previous versions.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> SHOULD NOT have replaces relationships listed.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
<ul>
<li>The new resource may not be a version of the old resource. For
example if an aggregation (lowercase a) is described again by a
different creator to the first description, and should be used instead
of it. For example, a third party could describe an important resource
and then the creator might describe it more authoritatively. One would
want to say that the new description replaces the old description, but
is not a version of it.</li>
</ul>

<br />
</dd>

<dt>Requirements</dt>
<dd>The described resource requires the referenced resource to support its function, delivery, or coherence of content.
<p>For example, a component resource may be a dataset that requires an
application to interact with it. The application may not be able to be
a component, and hence the necessity to identify how the resource is to
be displayed.
</p><ul>
<li>Name: dcterms:requires</li>
<li>URI: http://purl.org/dc/terms/requires</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> MUST NOT have requirements.</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MUST NOT have requirements. </li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MAY have requirements.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> SHOULD NOT have requirements.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
<ul>
<li>Every format requires some sort of interpreting software with which
to interact with it. For very common formats, we can assume that this
is not necessary but for custom datasets or rare formats, it would be
important for preservation and re-use to be able to reference the
software required. For example, an ARFF data file requires the WEKA
data mining toolkit.</li>
</ul>

<br />
</dd>


<dt>Thumbnail</dt>
<dd>The referenced resource is a thumbnail version of the described resource.
<ul>
<li>Name: foaf:thumbnail</li>
<li>URI: </li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> are not images and hence MUST NOT be part of a thumbnail relationship.</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> are not images and hence MUST NOT be part of a thumbnail relationship.</li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MAY be thumbnails, if they are images.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> MAY be thumbnails, if they are images.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
<ul>
<li>Flickr, PhotoBucket etc.  Or anything that has thumbnails that need to be explicitly described rather than using owl:sameAs.</li>
</ul>

<br />
</dd>

<dt>Version</dt>
<dd>The described resource has a version, edition, or adaption, namely the referenced resource.
<p>This relationship may be used to point to older versions of the
resource, to show how the resource has changed over time. For example,
if a new resource is added to the aggregation, it may be useful to
maintain the old aggregation as a separate version.
</p><ul>
<li>Name: dcterms:hasVersion</li>
<li>URI: http://purl.org/dc/terms/hasVersion</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Aggregations</i> MAY have versions.</li>
<li><i>Resource Maps</i> MAY have versions. </li>
<li><i>Aggregated Resources</i> MAY have versions.</li>
<li><i>External Resources</i> SHOULD NOT have versions listed.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Motivating Use Cases:</b>
<ul>
<li>Referencing older versions of Resource Maps or Aggregated
Resources. For example Arxiv descriptions link to previous versions of
the paper.</li>
</ul>

<div class="body">
<h2><a name="types" id="types"></a>3. Classes</h2>
<p>In order to give a semantic type to an object, we use rdf:type and a class from some vocabulary, as below:</p>
<blockquote>
<code>URI-AR1 rdf:type http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Collection</code>
</blockquote><p>The following classes, other than the final two required
for audience, are drawn from the DCMI Types Vocabulary and seem to be
generic and useful. However, there are of course many other
vocabularies with similarly generic and useful types. Suggestions as to
more appropriate or useful class heirarchies are encouraged.</p>

<h3>5.1 Generic Classes</h3>

<h3>5.2 Scholarly Communication Classes</h3>

<p>There are many different vocabularies which have tried to define
classes for scholarly communication, and choosing between them is non
trivial. We as a community should, however, come to some initial
decisions in order to demonstrate how other communities can bring their
own domain into the OAI-ORE world.
</p><p>The first three entries in the list above seem to be the most
appropriate, followed by the next two should the prove to be taken up
in practice. It's not necessary to pick terms from only one vocabulary,
but it's certainly easier. We certainly do not need to invent a new
one.
</p><p>
<br />
<b>Annotated bibliography:</b>
</p><dl>
<dt><a href="http://ontoware.org/projects/swrc/">http://ontoware.org/projects/swrc/</a></dt>
<dd>"The SWRC (Semantic Web for Research Communities) is an ontology
for modeling entities of research communities such as persons,
organisations, publications (bibliographic metadata) and their
relationships."
It seems to contain a good set of classes and relationships, with
intuitive names. Seems to be reasonably well used and published about.
The OWL was last updated (at time of writing) in June 2007, so seems
reasonably current.
<br /><br />
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.iswc2006.semanticweb.org/projects/semdis/swetodblp/">http://www.iswc2006.semanticweb.org/projects/semdis/swetodblp/</a>

</dt>
<dd>"SwetoDblp is a large-size ontology (spin-off of SWETO ontology)
focused on bibliography data of Computer Science publications where the
main data source is DBLP." Again, seems to have all of the classes that
we require. The second link above is to a comparison of SwetoDblp and
other ontologies. Seems current: recently published about and recently
updated (August 2007).
<br /><br />
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.marcont.org/ontology/documentation/marcont.html">http://www.marcont.org/ontology/documentation/marcont.html</a></dt>
<dd>Thankfully, no three digit numbers in sight! Has all of the useful
classes and properties. They describe the project: "The goal of MarcOnt
bibliographic ontology is to provide a uniform bibliographic
description format. It should capture concepts from existing formats
such as Bibtex, Dublin Core, MARC21." Recently updated (June 2007) and
ongoing work (2004-2007).

</dt>
<dd>A "simple vocabulary for use with the dc:type property" for
Eprints, from the Dublin Core community. Again, seems to cover the
majority of the types, but as of yet hard to assess how much takeup it

</dt>
<dd>Bruce D'Arcus and Frédérick Giasson's bibliographic ontology.
Quite current, but by no means finished. Seems to be a mpre recent
version of Bruce's <a href="http://vocab.org/biblio/schema">http://vocab.org/biblio/schema</a>,
and I guess is possible this will form the basis of OpenOffice 3.0's
bibliographic support. While not finished, it's mostly in need of
better documentation; the classes and relationships seem very good.

<dd>A very old (for the web) project from Stanford. Copyright is 1992,
but it defines a comprehensive set of classes and could easily be
brought into line with modern technologies.
<br /><br /></dd>

<dt><a href="http://zeitkunst.org/bibtex/0.1/">http://zeitkunst.org/bibtex/0.1/</a></dt>
<dd>Early version of bibTex in OWL, but doesn't seem to be actively
developed beyond 0.1, which has a lot of questions raised in the
description. 2004 and version 0.1, so unlikely to be useful other than
as a reference.

<dd>Semantically Interlinked Scientific Communities. Perhaps not
directly relevant, but a good demonstration of very similar work in a
specific discipline. Note the use of SIOC (Semantically Interlinked
Open Communities, http://sioc-project.org/,
http://www.w3.org/Submission/2007/02/ ) which seems to have a lot of
support.

<dd>Another related effort from the Biodiversity discipline, also very
current. It would be good to try to reach some sort of
cross-disciplinary consensus if possible!

<dd>FRBR derives ontology for bibliographic information. No
documentation could be found, so very hard to assess. Still, worthy of
a point in the list.

<dd>"Bibliographic Management using RSS Technology" (Not sure where the
M went?) "... is a lightweight specification for publishing
bibliographic information using RSS 1.0". Heh, that sounds kind of
familiar, though OAI-ORE isn't tied specifically to bibliographic
material and uses ATOM instead of RSS. Uses SWRC for classes etc, but
is worth looking over to compare to our approach.</dd>
