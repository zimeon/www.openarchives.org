<h2>1. <a id="Introduction" name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The Architecture of the World Wide Web [<a
href="#Web_Architecture">Web Architecture</a>] uses the term
<em>Resource</em> to refer to any item of interest. Some web content,
such as a stand-alone HTML document, is contained within one
Resource. But frequently a logical unit of web information is actually
an aggregation of Resources. Examples of these aggregations are:</p>

<ul>
			<li>A simple unordered set, or bag, of Resources, such as a collection 
			of favorite images from various Web sites.</li>
			<li>A multi-page, HTML document where the pages are linked together 
			by hyperlinks that provide &quot;previous page&quot; and &quot;next page&quot; access.</li>
			<li>Information available from &quot;social networking&quot; sites, which contain content and related social activity around that content. An example is 
			<a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a>, where each participant has an entry page providing access to images in multiple sizes and resolutions that are organized in sets and collections. All of these entities are separate Resources. These are then linked to additional Resources that are comments and annotations about the images.</li>
			<li>A scholarly publication stored in an ePrint repository such as
			<a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a> or in a
			<a href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a>,
			<a href="http://www.eprints.org">ePrints</a>, or
			<a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/">Fedora</a> repository. 
			Such a publication may appear on the Web as multiple Resources, each 
			with an individual URI. The set of Resources typically consists 
			of a human readable &quot;splash page&quot;, that links to the body of the publication 
			in multiple formats such as LaTeX, PDF, and HTML. In addition, 
			the publication may have citation links to other publications, each 
			existing as one or more Resources.</li>
			<li>An <em>overlay journal issue </em>that aggregates multiple scholarly 
			publications as described above, each located in their origin repository, 
			into an <em>issue</em>. Issues may be recursively aggregated themselves 
			into <em>volumes</em>, and then into the <em>journal </em>itself.</li>
			<li>A semantically-linked group of cellular images &mdash; each available 
			as a Resource resident in repositories from research laboratories, museums, 
			libraries, and the like &mdash; in the manner implemented in the
			<a href="http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk">ImageWeb Project</a>.</li>
			<li>Published scientific results such as those envisioned by&nbsp; [<a href="#Lynch_CTWatch">Lynch 
			CTWatch</a>] that, in addition to the features of the scholarly publication 
			described above, incorporate data plus the tools to visualize and analyze 
			that data.</li>
	</ul>

<p>These aggregations exhibit the following characteristics:</p>

	<ul>
          <li>They consist of one or more Resources, which all may be 
            located on one web server, or may be distributed over the Web.</li>
		  <li>Relationships  may exist  between  Resources in the aggregation
		    that express semantics indicating that one Resource has a containment 
		    relationship to another, one is an alternate version or format of another, 
		    and the like.</li>
		  <li>One or more of the  Resources in the aggregation may have types, where the types are  
		    defined by various vocabularies. Informal examples of such types 
		    are &quot;splash page&quot;, &quot;bibliography&quot;, or &quot;table of contents&quot;.</li>
		  <li>Relationships may exist  between the aggregation and/or the 
		    individual  Resources in the aggregation and information units external to the 
		    Aggregation. 
		    These external resources may be individual Resources or aggregations 
		    themselves. Examples of such relationships include citations, mirrors, 
		    and translations.</li>
	  </ul>

<p>A mechanism to associate identities with these aggregations and
describe them in a machine-readable manner would make them visible to
Web agents including browsers and crawlers. These machine-readable
descriptions could then be the basis of user interfaces, allowing
users to navigate and manipulate the aggregations. Some example
applications and contexts where &quot;aggregation-awareness&quot;
might be useful include:</p>

<ul>
			<li>Crawler-based search engines could use such descriptions to index 
			information and provide search results sets at the granularity of the 
			aggregations rather or in addition to their individual parts.</li>
			<li>Browsers could leverage them to provide users with navigation aids 
			for the aggregated resources, in the same manner that
			<a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">machine-readable site maps</a> provide 
			navigation clues for crawlers.</li>
			<li>Other automated agents such as preservation systems could use these 
			descriptions as guides to understand a &quot;whole document&quot; and determine 
			the
			best preservation strategy for the document [<a href="#Compound_Object">Compound Object</a>].</li>
			<li>Systems that mine and analyze networked information for citation 
			analysis/bibliometrics could achieve better accuracy with the knowledge 
			of aggregation structure contained in these descriptions.</li>
			<li>Institutional repository applications could use them as the basis of interoperability for exchange and service interaction with other institutional repositories.</li>
			<li>These machine-readable descriptions could provide the foundation 
			for advanced scholarly communication systems that allow the flexible 
			reuse and refactoring of rich scholarly artifacts and their components 
			[<a href="#Value_Chains">Value Chains</a>][<a href="#SCOPE">SCOPE</a>].</li>
</ul>

<p>This document describes the Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse
and Exchange (OAI-ORE) data model for the description and exchange of
aggregations of Web resources, named <a
href="#Aggregation">Aggregations</a>. OAI-ORE introduces the notion of
<a href="#Resource_Map">Resource Maps</a> that describe an
Aggregation. A Resource Map describes an Aggregation: it asserts the
finite set of constituent resources (the Aggregated Resources) of the
Aggregation, and it can express types and relationships pertaining to
the Aggregation and its Aggregated Resources. This data model conforms
to the concepts defined in the Architecture of the World Wide Web [<a
href="#Web_Architecture">Web Architecture</a>].</p>

<p>The ORE Model can be implemented in a variety of serialization
formats. The details of these formats are described in <a
href="toc">companion ORE documents</a>. The nature of a
particular serialization format and its respective expressiveness may
affect the details of the mapping from the model to the
implementation. This mapping is described in detail in each
serialization specification.</p>

<h2>2. <a id="Foundations" name="Foundations">Foundations</a></h2>

<p>The ORE Data Model builds on the following foundation technologies
and architectures.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The architecture of the World Wide Web  [<a href="#Web_Architecture">Web 
	Architecture</a>].</li>
  <li>Semantic Web concepts including RDF  [<a href="#RDF_Concepts">RDF
	Concepts</a>] and the RDF Vocabulary
	Description Language [<a href="#RDFS">RDFS</a>].</li>
  <li>Cool URIs [<a href="#ref-cool-uris">Cool URIs</a>] and Linked Data [<a href="#Linked_Data_Tutorial">Linked Data Tutorial</a>].</li>
</ul>

<p>Readers unfamiliar with these technologies are encouraged to refer
to reference documents for each. A brief introduction to the relevant
aspects of these technologies is also available in the <a
href="primer#Foundations">ORE Primer</a>.</p>

<h2>3. <a name="Entities" id="Entities">Data Model Entities</a></h2>

<p>The ORE Abstract Data Model includes the entities that are
described in the remainder of this section.</p>

<h3>3.1 <a name="Aggregation" id="Aggregation"></a>Aggregation</h3>

<p>An <span class="definition">Aggregation</span> is a Resource of
type <code>ore:Aggregation</code> that is a set of other
Resources. The type <code>ore:Aggregation</code> is associated with a
Resource via an assertion by at least one <a
href="#Resource_Map">Resource Map</a>. The association between a
Resource Map and an Aggregation is described in a <a
href="#ReM-to-aggr">section 4.1</a>.</p>

<p>This specification uses URI-A to denote URIs that identify
Aggregations. Because URI-A identifies the Aggregation, it SHOULD be
used as the target of links referring to the set of Resources as a
logical unit. Examples of such links are citation, review, annotation,
and the like.</p>

<p>Because a URI-A identifies the Aggregation, it SHOULD NOT be a URI
used for another purpose, such as the URI of a specific manifestation
of some content &mdash; for example, the PDF of some scholarly paper
&mdash; or the URI of a human-readable &quot;splash page&quot;, which
really identifies only that page and not the Aggregation as a
whole.</p>

<p>A URI-A MUST be a protocol-based URI. However, an Aggregation is a
conceptual construct, and thus it does not have a Representation. In
contrast, a Resource Map that asserts the Aggregation does have a
Representation in which that assertion is made available to clients
and agents. The <a href="#ref-cool-uris">Cool URIs for the Semantic
Web guidlines</a> are adopted to support discovery of the HTTP URI of
the asserting Resource Map given the HTTP URI of an
Aggregation. Details about the mechanisms of access are described in
<a href="http">ORE User Guide - HTTP Implementation</a>.</p>

<h3>3.2 <a name="Aggregated_Resource" id="Aggregated_Resource"></a>Aggregated Resource</h3>

<p>An <span class="definition">Aggregated Resource</span> is a
Resource that is a constituent of an Aggregation due to an assertion
in a <a href="#Resource_Map">Resource Map</a> that describes the
containing Aggregation.The manner in which these assertions are made
is described in <a href="#ore:aggregates">section 4.3</a>.</p>

<p>This specification uses URI-AR to denote URIs that identify
Aggregated Resources. A URI-AR MUST be a protocol-based URI.</p>

<h3>3.3 <a id="Resource_Map" name="Resource_Map">Resource Map (ReM)</a></h3>

<p>A <span class="definition">Resource Map</span> (<span
class="definition">ReM</span>) is a Resource, with type
<code>ore:ResourceMap</code>, with information content consisting of
assertions that:</p>

<ul>
<li>MUST describe a single Aggregation.</li>
<li>MUST enumerate the constituent Aggregated Resources.</li>
<li>MAY include additional properties about the
Aggregation and Aggregated Resources, such as
relationships among the Aggregated Resources,
relationships from the Aggregated Resources to other
Resources, and other properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>The nature of these assertions are described in <a href="#ReM-to-aggr">section 4.1</a>.</p>

<p>Each Resource Map MUST be identified by a single protocol-based
URI, which MUST be distinct from the Aggregation identified by the
Resource Map. This specification uses URI-R to denote URIs that
identify Resource Maps.  There MAY be multiple Resource Maps for a
single Aggregation.  Each Resource Map MUST have a distinct URI
(rather than forming multiple Representations from a single URI-R).  A
deference of a URI-R results in a serialization which the assertions
described above can be extracted as a set of triples that when
combined form an <a href="#RDF_Graph">RDF Graph</a> that MUST conform
to a <a href="#RDF_Graph">well-defined structure</a>.</p>

<p>Multiple Resource Maps MAY contain assertions about the same
Aggregation, identified in each with a single URI, URI-A. These
Resource Maps fall into two classes:</p>

<ul>
	    <li>An <span class="definition">Authoritative Resource Map</span> is one that is accessible via a dereference of the  URI-A of the Aggregation that it describes. Details about the mechanisms of access are described in <a href="http">ORE User Guide - HTTP Implementation</a>. There MUST be at least one Authoritative Resource Map for each Aggregation. There MAY be many Authoritative Resource Maps for an Aggregation, each with a unique URI-R. As noted above each URI-R MUST dereference to one serialization. The serializations available from this set of URI-Rs SHOULD be in distinct formats (e.g., <a href="atom">ATOM</a>, <a href="rdfxml">RDF/XML</a>). However, the RDF graph derivable from those serializations MUST express the same <a href="#ore:aggregates">Aggregation Graph</a> and define the same <a href="#Proxies">Proxies</a>.</li>
        <li>A <span class="definition">Non-Authoritative Resource Map</span> is one that contains assertions about a URI-A, without reference from information
          obtained via a dereference of URI-A. Because of the nature of the Web, where agents may assert any information, multiple non-authoritative Resource Maps MAY exist.  Clients SHOULD assume that the agent or authority responsible for the creation of a non-authoritative Resource Map is independent from and not recognized by the agent or authority responsible for the Aggregation.  Note that because of their creation by independent agents, this specification expresses no rules about their composition. It is RECOMMENDED that Agents  not create  non-authoritative Resource Maps. Instead, an agent SHOULD define another URI-A (a distinct aggregation), define one or more Authoritative Resource Maps describing that Aggregation, and use the methods described <a href="#ore:similarTo">below</a> to assert a relationship between the two Aggregations.<br />
        </li>
 </ul>

<p>Unless specifically noted, the remainder of this specification will
describe only authoritative Resource Maps. The qualifier
&quot;authoritative&quot; will only be used for appropriate
emphasis.</p>

<h3>3.4 <a name="Proxy" id="Proxy"></a>Proxy</h3>

<p>A <span class="definition">Proxy</span> is a Resource, with type
<code>ore:Proxy</code>, that indicates an Aggregated Resource in the
context of a specific Aggregation. The type <code>ore:Proxy</code> is
associated with a Resource via an assertion in a <a
href="#Resource_Map">Resource Map</a> that describes the Aggregation
that is the context of the Proxy.The URI of a Proxy, indicated by
URI-P throughout this specification, then can be used in assertions
specific to the Aggregated Resource in the context of that
aggregation. This contrasts with the URI-AR of the Aggregated
Resource, which has no special meaning relative to the Aggregation.
The use of Proxies, which are OPTIONAL, is described in <a
href="#Proxies">section 5.3</a>.</p>

<p>A Proxy URI (URI-P) MUST be unique to both an Aggregation (URI-A)
and to a particular Aggregated Resource (URI-AR) of that
Aggregation. Using the terminology described 
<a href="#Resource_Map">above</a> this means that a URI-P asserted in an
authoritative Resource Map for one URI-A MUST NOT be asserted in
Resource Maps that describe another URI-A. When implemented using
HTTP, Proxy URIs SHOULD conform to 
<a href="http#ProxyRequirements">certain requirements</a>.</p>

<h2>4. <a id="RDF_Graph" name="RDF_Graph">RDF Graph of a Resource Map - Basics</a></h2>

<p>A Resource Map asserts a set of RDF triples expressing information
about an Aggregation, its constituent Aggregated Resources, metadata
about the Aggregation and Resource Map, and other Relationships. The
RDF Graph that is manifested by the triples asserted by a Resource Map
MUST conform to a number of restrictions. The graph MUST be
connected, with its structure defined as follows (and expanded upon in
the numbered section accompanying each bullet):</p>

<ul>
	<li>It MUST express the relationship between the Resource Map and the Aggregation 
	described by the Resource Map (<a href="#ReM-to-aggr">4.1</a>).</li>
	<li>It MUST express basic metadata about the Resource Map and MAY express 
	additional metadata about the Resource Map and Aggregation (<a href="#Metadata_about_the_ReM">4.2</a>).</li>
	<li>It MUST express the relationships between the Aggregation and one or more 
	Aggregated Resources that are constituents of the Aggregation. (The subgraph of 
	the Resource Map resulting from these relationships is referred to as the 
	Aggregation Graph) <a href="#ore:aggregates">(4.3</a>).</li>
	<li>It MAY express relationships between the Aggregation and similar resources 
	(<a href="#ore:similarTo">4.4</a>).</li>
	<li>It MAY express r<a>elationships between Resources in the Aggregation Graph 
	and other Resources and Types</a> (<a href="#GlobalRels">4.5</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The remainder of this section explains the components of this graph
in a step-by-step progression. The constraints on the graph are
summarized in a <a href="#Constraints">table</a> later in this
document.</p>

<p>Later sections describe how to extend this RDF Graph to assert 
<a href="#ore:isAggregatedBy">relationships between Aggregations</a>
and the use of <a href="#Proxies">Proxies</a> to <a
href="#Proxies">establish Aggregation-specific URIs for Aggregated
Resources</a>.</p>

<h3>4.1 <a id="ReM-to-aggr" name="ReM-to-aggr">Relationship between a Resource Map and an Aggregation</a></h3>

<p>A Resource Map MUST include one triple with an
<code>ore:describes</code> predicate. The subject of this triple MUST
be the URI-R of the Resource Map. The object is the URI-A of the
Aggregation described by the Resource Map.  The URI-A that is the
object of this triple MUST NOT be the same as URI-R. A Resource Map
MUST NOT include more than one triple with the
<code>ore:describes</code> predicate.</p>

<p>The <code>ore:describes</code> relationship asserts that the
Resource denoted by the subject is a resource of type
<code>ore:ResourceMap</code> and the Resource denoted by the object is
a resource of type <code>ore:Aggregation</code>.  Therefore, the
explicit inclusion in the Resource Map of triples asserting these
types is OPTIONAL.</p>

<p>The figure below illustrates the RDF Graph expressing the
relationship between a Resource Map and an Aggregation. The triples
producing the graph are included below the graph.  The table to the
right of the triples shows the URIs used to identify the Resources and
relationships. The syntax of the URIs in the triples table are
illustrative only and the reader SHOULD NOT infer metadata about the
identified resource from the form of the URIs. The 
<a href="http">ORE User Guide - HTTP Implementation</a> describes
implementation details on suggested syntax for URIs used in ORE.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="datamodel-images/RemToAggregation1.jpg" alt="Relationship between a Resource Map and an Aggregation" width="642" height="184" /></p>

<p>As described earlier, multiple Resource Maps MAY assert an
<code>ore:describes</code> relationship with the same URI-A as the
object of the triple. In the case where there are multiple Resource
Maps, each Resource Map SHOULD assert a triple with the
<code>ore:isDescribedBy</code> predicate (the inverse of
<code>ore:describes</code>) expressing a relationship with each other
authoritative Resource Map. These triples make alternate
serializations of a Resource Map visible to clients.</p>

<p>The figure below illustrates the existence of multiple Resource
Maps and the use of the <code>ore:isDescribedBy</code> predicate. Note
that the illustrated assertions are expressed by <code>ReM-1</code> in
the figure.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="datamodel-images/RemToAggregation2.jpg" alt="Multiple Resource Maps" width="631" height="441" /></p>

<h3>4.2 <a id="Metadata_about_the_ReM" name="Metadata_about_the_ReM">Metadata about the Resource Map and Aggregation</a></h3>

<p>A Resource Map MUST express minimal metadata properties about the
Resource Map. Those metadata properties are:</p>

	<ul>
			<li>The  identity of the authoring authority (human, organization, or 
			agent) of the Resource Map, using the <code>dcterms:creator</code> predicate, with an object that  MUST be a reference to a Resource of type <code>http://purl.org/dc/terms/Agent</code>. This MAY then be the subject of the following triples:
			<ul>
			  <li>A triple with  the predicate <code>foaf:name</code> and an object that is a text string containing some descriptive name of the authoring authority.</li>
			  <li>A triple with  the predicate <code>foaf:mbox</code> and an object that is a  URI that is the email address of the authoring authority.</li>

		  </li>
	      <li>The last modification date-timestamp of the Resource Map, using the

			MUST be updated when the triples asserted within the Resource Map, and expressed in the serializations of that Resource Map,  change so that 
			consuming clients of the can determine appropriate actions.</li>
	</ul>

<p>A Resource Map MAY include additional metadata properties about the
Resource Map. Examples of additional metadata properties
are:</p>

	<ul>
		  <li>Rights information related to the use of the Resource Map, using 
			the <code>dc:rights</code> term. (Note rights information for the Resource Map is distinct from that for the Aggregation.  The latter MAY be described separately as described below.)&nbsp; </li>
			<li>The initial creation datetimestamp of the Resource Map, using the
			<code>dcterms:created</code> term.</li>
        </ul>

<p>A Resource Map MAY assert metadata properties about the
Aggregation. These metadata properties MAY be defined by a variety of
vocabularies. A common metadata property is the identity of the
authoring authority (human, organization, or agent) of the
Aggregation, using the <code>dcterms:creator</code>
predicate.</p>

<p>The figure below shows an RDF Graph expressed by a Resource Map
that includes metadata properties about Resource Map and
Aggregation. Note that aspects of the graph already described
are grayed-out to emphasize the concepts introduced by the
figure. This convention will be used for the remainder of this
document along with other simplifications to make the figures easier
to read.</p>

<h3>4.3 <a name="ore:aggregates" id="ore:aggregates">Aggregated Resources and the Aggregation Graph</a></h3>

<p>A Resource Map MAY include one or more triples with the
<code>ore:aggregates</code> predicate. Each asserts that the object of
the predicate identified by URI-AR is an 
<a href="#Aggregated_Resource">Aggregated Resource</a> of the subject
identified by URI-A. A URI-AR MUST NOT be the same as the URI-A of
the Aggregation that is the subject of the <code>ore:aggregates</code>
predicate.</p>

<p>The <code>ore:aggregates</code> relationship defines that the
Resource denoted by the subject is a Resource of type
<code>ore:Aggregation</code>. Therefore, the explicit inclusion
in the Resource Map of a triple asserting the type is OPTIONAL.</p>

<p>A Resource Map MAY include one or more triples with the
<code>ore:isAggregatedBy</code> predicate to assert that an Aggregated
Resources is a <a href="#ore:isAggregatedBy">constituent of other
Aggregations</a>.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the RDF Graph with the addition of triples
with the <code>ore:aggregates</code> predicate. This subgraph of
the RDF Graph, rooted in the Aggregation with one or more
<code>ore:aggregates</code> relationships to Aggregated Resources, is
known as the <span class="definition">Aggregation
Graph</span>.As described earlier, all authoritative Resource
Maps describing the same Aggregation MUST assert the same Aggregation
Graph.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="datamodel-images/ReMAggregates.jpg" alt="Aggregation with ore:aggregates figure" width="630" height="331" /></p>

<p>For a Resource Map <code>http://example.org/ReM-1</code>, the
Aggregation Graph is defined by the following SPARQL query [<a
href="#SPARQL">SPARQL</a>].</p>

<div class="exampleInner">
<pre>PREFIX ore: &lt;http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/&gt;
CONSTRUCT   { ?a ore:aggregates ?ar1 . }
WHERE       { &lt;http://example.org/ReM-1&gt; ore:describes ?a .
              ?a ore:aggregates ?ar1 . }</pre>
</div>

<h3>4.4 <a name="ore:similarTo" id="ore:similarTo">Relationships between the Aggregation and Similar Resources</a></h3>

<p>A Resource Map MAY include one or more triples, with URI-A as the
subject, which assert that the Aggregation is a Resource with content
that is similar to another Resource. The predicate MAY be either
<code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> or its sub-property
<code>ore:similarTo</code>. The predicate actually used depends on the
strength of the assertion of similarity.</p>

<p>The <code>ore:similarTo</code> relationship asserts that the
Aggregation has similar intellectual content to the Resource
identified by the object of the triple.  An example of the use of
<code>ore:similarTo</code> in the scholarly communication context is
the relationship between an Aggregation and a Resource with
non-protocol-based URI like a Digital Object Identifier [<a
href="#DOI">DOI</a>] or an info URI [<a href="#INFO">INFO</a>].</p>

<p>An example of the use of the weaker <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> in a
Resource Map is the relationship between two Aggregations that have an
<code>ore:similarTo</code> relationship to the same DOI.</p>

<p>The use of <code>ore:similarTo</code> and <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code>
predicates in a Resource Map is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="datamodel-images/AggrSameAs.jpg" alt="Aggregation associated with other resource using ore:similarTo" width="631" height="489" /></p>

<h3>4.5 <a name="GlobalRels" id="GlobalRels"> Relationships to other Resources and Types</a></h3>

<p>A Resource Map MAY include additional triples that assert
properties about the Resource Map, Aggregation, Aggregated Resources,
or other related Resources or Literals. The RDF graph produced by the
addition of these triples MUST be <em>connected</em>. Formally that
means that all nodes in the graph MUST be reachable via a traversal
that begins at the node denoting the Resource Map and follows the
edges corresponding to the predicates expressed in the triples.</p>

<p>Some appropriate uses for  additional relationships are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They MAY define the semantic types of the nodes in the Aggregation Graph.
    In this case, the subject is a node in the Aggregation
    Graph (the URI of  either the Aggregation or an Aggregated Resource), a predicate
    that is <code>rdf:type</code>, and an object that is the URI of a
    Class defined by any vocabulary.</li>
  <li>They MAY define the relationships of the Aggregation or an Aggregated Resource  to other Resources.
    The predicate of these relationships MAY
    be defined in any vocabulary. These relationships are useful for
    metadata properties of the Aggregation Graph and/or the Aggregation, citation linkages,  mirrors, and the like.</li>
</ul>

<p>The scope of these additional assertions corresponds to the global
manner in which RDF statements are interpreted. That is, the meaning
of these additional triples are not constrained or altered by their
&quot;assertion context&quot; in a Resource Map. Each assertion is
essentially independent, and therefore a triple with subject URI-AR is
a statement about that Resource without reference to its existence in
the respective Aggregation. Assertions about Resources contextualized
by the Aggregation via the use of <a href="#Proxies">Proxies</a> are
described in <a href="#InterAggr">section 5.3.1</a>.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the RDF Graph with the addition of triples
expressing type semantics and other relationships to the Aggregation
Graph.</p>

<h3>5.<a name="RDF_Graph_Advanced" id="RDF_Graph_Advanced"> RDF Graph of a Resource Map - Advanced</a></h3>

<p>This specification has thus far included the mechanisms for
describing an individual Aggregation. This section describes
mechanisms by which one Resource Map MAY assert relationships between
Aggregated Resources and other Resource Maps or Aggregations.</p>

<h3>5.1<a name="ore:isAggregatedBy" id="ore:isAggregatedBy"> Asserting that an Aggregated Resource is a constituent of another Aggregation</a></h3>

<p>A Resource Map MAY include one or more triples with the
<code>ore:isAggregatedBy</code> predicate to assert that an Aggregated
Resources is a constituent of other Aggregations.</p>

<p>A use case is <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a>, in which
it is possible for a picture to be a member of multiple sets. The
Resource Map describing a set might include information about other
set memberships of its constituent pictures. The figure below shows
three Aggregations, <code>A-1</code>, <code>A-2</code>, and
<code>A-3</code>, corresponding to the three sets in flickr. All
include some image, <code>AR-3</code>, as an Aggregated Resource. The
Resource Map <code>ReM-3</code>, which describes the flickr set
<code>A-3</code>, includes triples with the predicate
<code>ore:isAggregatedBy</code>, asserting that <code>AR-3</code> is
constituent of the sets denoted by the Aggregations <code>A-1</code>
and <code>A-2</code>.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="datamodel-images/extLinkAggregatedBy.jpg" alt="Use of isAggregatedBy figure" width="607" height="408" /></p>

<h3>5.2 <a name="ore:isDescribedBy" id="ore:isDescribedBy">Nesting Aggregations  </a></h3>

<p>As stated earlier, any Resource can be an Aggregated Resource in
some Aggregation. Because an Aggregation is itself a Resource, it can
be an Aggregated Resource in some other Aggregation.  The result is
then <em>recursive nesting </em>of Aggregations. Note that this
nesting MUST be expressed in multiple Resource Maps, since one
Resource Map MUST describe only one Aggregation.</p>

<p>A Resource Map that asserts another Aggregation as an Aggregated
Resource MAY assert an <code>ore:isDescribedBy</code> relationship
between this Aggregated Resource and a Resource Map describing the
other Aggregation. This informs clients of the Resource Map of the
nesting.</p>

<p>Note that this use of the <code>ore:isDescribedBy</code> predicate
has the same semantics as described 
<a href="#ReM-to-aggr">earlier</a>. The predicate asserts that the
subject of the triple, which is an Aggregation, is described by the
object of the triple, which is a Resource Map.</p>

<p>An example of a nested Aggregation is a <em>journal </em>consisting
of multiple <em>issues</em>, each of which is an Aggregation of
multiple <em>articles</em>, each of which may be an Aggregation in its
own right. The figure below illustrates nested Aggregations,
omitting some details of previous figures (e.g. metadata,
typing). Aggregation <code>A-1</code>, described by
<code>ReM-1</code>, has constituents <code>AR-1</code>,
<code>AR-2</code> and <code>AR-3</code>, which are themselves
Aggregations. Each of these &quot;aggregated Aggregations&quot;
is described by a corresponding Resource Map (<code>ReM-2</code>,
<code>ReM-3</code>, and <code>ReM-4</code>) which describes the
Aggregated Resources and other aspects of these Aggregations. The
sub-graphs associated with these other Resource Maps are intentionally
grayed out to emphasize the fact that the triples relevant to this
example are exclusive to <code>ReM-1</code>.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="datamodel-images/recursive.jpg" alt="Nested Aggregations figure" width="635" height="485" /></p>

<h3>5.3.<a name="Proxies" id="Proxies">Proxies for Aggregated Resources</a></h3>

<p>This specification has thus far used the URI-AR of an Aggregated
Resource as the subject or object of triples. As described earlier, a
URI-AR is not specific to the Aggregation &mdash; an individual URI-AR
MAY be asserted within multiple Aggregations and MAY be used
independent of any Aggregation. Thus, the use of URI-AR as the subject
or object of triples does not imply any association with one
Aggregation, or even with any Aggregation at all.</p>

<p>In some cases it is useful to assert relationships to Aggregated
Resources in a manner specific to the Aggregation context. These
relationships may be among Aggregated Resources or between Aggregated
Resources and Resources external to the Aggregation. A URI distinct
from the URI-AR is then necessary.</p>

<p>This section describes the notion of a <span
class="definition">Proxy</span>, which is a Resource that &quot;stands
for&quot; an Aggregated Resource in a manner that is specific to one
Aggregation. The URI-P of this Proxy is then available for use in
triples where the intended semantics is a relationship specific to the
Aggregated Resource in the context of the respective Aggregation.
Note that the assertion of Proxies is OPTIONAL and unnecessary if
context-specific assertions are not needed.</p>

<p>The URI-P of the Proxy MUST be unique to the Aggregation.  A
Resource Map MUST assert two triples to associate the Proxy with the
Aggregation and Aggregated Resource.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first has the URI of the Proxy as the subject, the predicate <code>ore:proxyFor</code>, and the URI of the associated Aggregated Resource as the object.</li>
  <li>The second has the URI of the Proxy as the subject, the predicate <code>ore:proxyIn</code>, and the URI of the associated Aggregation as the object.</li>
</ul>

<p>A Resource Map MUST assert only one of each of these pairs of
triples for each Proxy. All authoritative Resource Maps for an
Aggregation MUST assert the same Proxies.</p>

<p>The remainder of this section describes use cases for Proxies and
how to express them in the Resource Map</p>

<h4>5.3.1 <a name="InterAggr" id="InterAggr"></a>Proxies: Relationships among Aggregated Resources</h4>

<p>An example of the use of Proxies for relationships among Aggregated
Resources is the assertion of sequencing between Aggregated Resources,
expressing an ordered list where <code>AR-1</code> follows
<code>AR-2</code> which follows <code>AR-3</code>. Without any
sequencing information, the order of Aggregated Resources can not be
inferred &mdash; they form an unordered set. It would not be
legitimate for the Resource Map to express this sequencing by
asserting a triple of the sort <code>&lt;AR-1&gt; &lt;hasNext&gt;
&lt;AR-2&gt;</code>, since this fact is only true in the context of
the specific Aggregation, and is not a &quot;global&quot; fact. As
noted <a href="#GlobalRels">earlier</a>, in RDF the meaning of triples
are not constrained or altered by their &quot;assertion context&quot;
in a Resource Map. Each assertion is essentially independent, and
therefore a triple with subject or object URI-AR is a statement about
that Aggregated Resource without reference to its existence in the
respective Aggregation. Therefore, a relationship such as the
previously mentioned &quot;sequence&quot; must be expressed in terms
of Proxies that denote Aggregated Resources contextualized by a
specific Aggregation</p>

<p>The following figure illustrates how to express this
Aggregation-specific sequencing via the definition of proxies and
assertion of related triples in a Resource Map. The hypothetical
predicate <code>xyz:hasNext</code> used in the figure indicates a
sequencing relationship between the two Aggregated Resources. The
Resource Map <code>ReM-1</code> defines two Proxies <code>P-1</code>
and <code>P-2</code>. It also asserts triples with the
<code>ore:proxyFor</code> and <code>ore:proxyIn</code> predicates that
associate the Proxies with the respective Aggregated Resource and with
the Aggregation. These Proxies are then the subject and object of the
<code>xyz:hasNext</code> predicate, asserting the sequencing
relationship in the context of the Aggregation.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="datamodel-images/Proxy.jpg" alt="Proxy node figure" width="564" height="432" /></p>

<h4>5.3.2. <a name="ProxyTarget" id="ProxyTarget"></a>Proxies: Externally asserted relationships to Aggregated Resources</h4>

<p>A Proxy can be the subject or object of triples asserted elsewhere,
with semantics that the relationship asserted by the triples are
specific to the Aggregated Resources contextualized by the
Aggregation.</p>

<p>The figure below illustrates an example of this use of a Proxy. In
the example, the Aggregation <code>A-1</code> may be a collection of
best scholarly papers found on the web about some selected topic.
<code>AR-1</code> is one of these selected papers. A citation to that
paper, asserted by the triple <code>&lt;URI-2&gt; &lt;xyz:cites&gt;
&lt;AR-1&gt;</code>, carries no semantics about the selection of the
paper in the &quot;best papers&quot; collection, because the URI
<code>AR-1</code> is simply the identity of the paper. However, the
triple <code>&lt;URI-1&gt; &lt;xyz:cites&gt; &lt;P-1&gt;</code>, where
<code>P-1</code> is asserted by the Resource Map to be the Proxy for
<code>AR-1</code>, is semantically a citation to that paper as a
constituent of the &quot;best papers&quot; collection.</p>

<p>The assertion of Proxies is OPTIONAL. This example demonstrates
that it MAY make sense for an agency creating Resource Maps to assert
these Proxies to provide appropriate link targets for outside
clients.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="datamodel-images/ContextLink.jpg" alt="Context link figure" width="587" height="209" /></p>

<h4>5.3.3. <a name="Lineage" id="Lineage">Proxies: Lineage of an Aggregated Resource</a></h4>

<p>As described <a href="#ore:isAggregatedBy">earlier</a>, the
<code>ore:isAggregatedBy</code> predicate asserts that an Aggregated
Resource in one Aggregation is also an Aggregated Resource in another
Aggregation. In fact, one Aggregated Resource MAY be in multiple
Aggregations, and therefore it MAY be the subject of multiple
<code>ore:isAggregatedBy</code> triples. In applications such as
scholarly communication there is a need for a stronger relationship
indicating <span class="definition">lineage</span>, which indicates
that an Aggregated Resource originated or was sourced from another
Aggregation. Lineage or provenance is one basis of integrity in
scholarly communication.</p>

<p>A Resource Map MAY assert triples with the predicate
<code>ore:lineage</code> to express this notion. The subject of
<code>ore:lineage</code> MUST be a Proxy specific to the Aggregation
and the object MUST be a Proxy specific to another Aggregation. Both
the subject and object Proxy Resource MUST be proxies for the same
Aggregated Resource.  In other words, the Resource Map for subject
Proxy MUST contain a triple <code>&lt;P-1&gt; &lt;ore:proxyFor&gt;
&lt;AR-1&gt;</code> and the Resource Map for object Proxy MUST contain
a triple <code>&lt;P-2&gt; &lt;ore:proxyFor&gt; &lt;AR-1&gt;</code>
where <code>AR-1</code> is the same in both triples. One Proxy MUST
NOT be the subject of more than one <code>ore:lineage</code>
relationships expressed in a Resource Map.</p>

<p>The following figure illustrates the use of
<code>ore:lineage</code>. Aggregation <code>A-1</code> is an eScience
result aggregating, with other Resources not shown, some data set,
<code>AR-1</code>. Aggregation <code>A-2</code> includes the same data
set. Both Resource Maps establish proxies for that Aggregated
Resource, <code>P-1</code> in <code>A-1</code> and <code>P-2</code> in
<code>A-2</code>, creating Aggregation-specific URIs for the data
set. <code>ReM-2</code> also asserts the triple
<code>&lt;P-2&gt;</code> <code>&lt;ore-lineage&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;P-1&gt;</code> to express the origin or provenance of the
data set in Aggregation <code>A-1</code>.</p>

<h2>6.<a name="Constraints" id="Constraints"></a>Structural Constraints on a Resource Map</h2>

<p>The following table summarizes the constraints on the structure of
