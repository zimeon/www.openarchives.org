<h2>Strategy for discontinuation of Version 1.0 of the Metadata Harvesting Protocol 
  of the OAI.</h2>
<h3>1. July 3rd 2001 </h3>
<p>1.a. Release of OAI 1.1 protocol and change of status of OAI 1.0 to deprecated. 
</p>
<p>- The effect is that OAI 1.0 will continue to be accepted by the OAI registration 
  validator. When registering, registrants are warned that version 1.0 will become 
  obsolete by December 1st 2001. </p>
<p>- Implementations of this new version will return 1.1 as their protocol version 
  in response to the Identify request. </p>
<p>1.b. Provision of a <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/1.1/migration.htm">migration 
  document</a> detailing the changes required by data and service providers to 
  become conformant with 1.1. The number of changes to be made to achieve conformance 
  with 1.1. are small. </p>
<h3>2. September 1st 2001 </h3>
<p>Soft rejection of OAI 1.0 by the OAI registration validator. </p>
<p>- No new registrations of sites using 1.0 will be allowed. </p>
<p>- All previous registrants still at version 1.0 will be warned that a hard 
  reject from the registration database will result by December 1st 2001. </p>
<h3>3. December 1st 2001 OAI 1.0 is made obsolete. </h3>
<p>The OAI registration validator will reject sites that do not support 1.1. </p>
