Herbert reported a broken link inside openarchivesprotocol.htm.  Fixed
this link (copy/OAISC/alpha-testing-press-release.htm should be
meetings/steering/alpha-testing-press-release.htm).

Broken link to OAI/1.1/openarchivesprotocol.html
The most recent version of that was OAI/1.1/openarchivesprotocol.htm
(windows wars again).  So, I put a link from the former to the latter.
I don't know who/what is referring to the html extension.
