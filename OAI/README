Directory cleanup - got rid of duplicate copy of migration.html
The official one is now OAI/1.1/migration.htm -- Donna

May 20, 2002:

Directory cleanup.  htdocs/OAI_protocol no longer the official
OAI directory.  Changed top-level index.html to point into this
directory (htdocs/OAI).  Replace www.clir.org/dlf with 
www.diglib.org.  Changed groups on many files from lagoze to web.
Removed some spurious execute priviledges.  Made archive and copy
non-world readable.  Changed protocol.htm[l] to be links, not
copies, of 1.1/openarchivesprotocol.  Blew away the 2.0a3 directory.

Stuff prior to October 22, 2001:

1.  This directory contains stuff that is seen when you go to
http://oaisrv.nsdl.cornell.edu protocol document.

1.0/ etc. are sub-directories that contain different versions 
of the protocol.  A copy of openarchivesprotocol is taken from
the latest sub-directory and stored in openarchivesprotocol.html.

The subdirectories contain the .html files and all the .xsd files
referred to by the protocol document.

The *.xsd files are copies of the 1.0/ xsd files and are to be
kept in this directory until Protocol 1.0 has been entirely
expunged.  As of protocol 1.1, the xsd files are referred to
by a link that contains the version number.

"migration.html" is the short document giving the steps whereby
people could migrate from Protocol 1.0 to 1.1.

October 17, 2001

   Temporarily stored baseURL.html here so that Michael Nelson could
   refer to it.  We are working on this as an OAI tech issue.
   - Donna Bergmark

October 22, 2001

   Removed baseURL.html.  See my own notes directory for final copy.
   Made fixes to openarchivesprotocol.html, as per Michael Nelson.

December 2002

   RejectedSites contain the sites that were removed from the OAI
   database during the December 1, 2002 purge.  They are sites that
   were still at 1.1 as of that time.  This list is pointed to by
   /web/OAI/cgi-bin/BrowseSites.pl, so if you move this list, you
   should also update BrowseSites.pl
